  "post_message": "Oh where to begin. I ll post here because apparently my emailed complaint might take 3 days to respond to.  Order 246776485 - your systems are currently showing it as delivered this evening  but it wasn t.  Imagine you have a \u00a350 incentive reward card  in the format of a Mastercard. Imagine you also have a delivery saver refund of \u00a315.  Now imagine  that having put the code through  at checkout it tells you the exact amount to pay is \u00a350.  Then  the next day  the store tries to put through a payment of over \u00a370  because that s how the system works . Really? You check cards for a higher payment than that to be charged?   Yes we check the card before any vouchers or delivery saver comes off  said the clueless woman on the phone.  Erm  overstepping the mark part 1 there. I authorised \u00a350 at checkout  not \u00a371.   That s what would happen if you shopped in store  said the clueless woman on the phone.  now let s see... you would scan my shopping  then scan any vouchers... nope you don t know if I am paying by card or cash at this point but would tell me the amount. So no  it isn t what would happen in store.  I then get home from work after telling you to stick the order up your backside to be told by the teenage children that you also called my home number & asked one of them to make an alternative payment.  I m sure he d pay you it back  was what was said.  Overstepping the mark part 2 there Tesco  discussing my account with other people.  I look forward to my voucher being given back to me too  that was for monies already paid to you.",

  "post_message": "Just wanted to post a massive big thank you to the customer service girl who was working within Bidston Tesco  Wirral last night.  After having a really bad day yesterday as well as feeling unwell  on returning an item for a refund I realised I couldn t locate my bank card although I had used it 10 minutes earlier in a different shop.  The kind girl on customer services contacted the shop I had previously been in and confirmed I had left it in the chip & pin machine in error.  I left Tesco to go and collect my card and on my return the lovely girl not only carried out the transaction I wanted but had written a lovely card and produced a bottle of wine and instructed me to go home and put my feet up!  It was such a totally unexpected act of kindness xx",

  "post_message": "Tesco  WHY do you have to keep adding artificial sweeteners to drinks that are not marketed as  low sugar  or  No sugar ?? For example  your Tesco  tangy & refreshing 50% Fruit Juice Orange squash . Opened a new bottle and the first mouthful of the drink immediately left a peculiar  and unpleasant  taste in my mouth  which I recognised as an artificial sweetener - Sucralose to be precise.  I had not noticed the  new recipe  tag  or I would have checked closer before buying it.  I also think the other tag on the bottle (pictured below) is misleading  as Sucralose is an artificial flavour (sweeteners are a flavour to most people)!!!!!!",

As this takes about 3-4 mins to cook and even less time to devour  it s the perfect choice. So it would seem  whilst tucking into my meal I came across 2 strands of plastic. Probably completely harmless if consumed but nevertheless probably the furthest thing from a vegetable.

They arranged for a wheelchair to take her out of the way  brought a blanker and arranged for paramedics to come. They also waited until they arrived. I had my young son in the trolley and my daughter in a pram and they also had a lovely staff member come and assist me with my children and trolley to the tills and back to my car. Thank you so much to you all.",

She s arthritic  blind in one eye and about 50% vision in the other and has recently had a few accidents with hot kettles so we thought a coffee machine would be useful. And we told her her nearest shop  Tesco in Carlton  sells the pods so should be ok for easy access.  I got a call off her today to pick some pods up from asda cos she can t make sense of the Tesco prices after struggling to see the SELs in the first place. So i nipped in and just across a single range of pods there was 3 different comparative prices. Per 100g  per unit or per kg. Is this really the best you can do? Don t you believe in clarity and clear pricing for your customers? I have put pictures in the comments   Maybe it was a stroke of luck as I ve now been told they re on offer at Asda",

I was desperately trying to find a santa list present so I checked online  spoke to local stores  they checked stock of other stores  I spoke to the central telephone line 4 times and I messaged on FB. Supposedly the item wasn t made in the size I wanted (even though I d seen it in that size in store previously!!)  and when that point was conceded  I was told it was completely out of stock throughout the whole country. One quick FB ask to friends and family and I was found one in Kent. How come Tesco couldn t find me one in their own stores but the mother in law could?! If your stock system can t give you a correct answer  I would rather know that than be told a lie. If I had taken your answer at face value I would have had a very unhappy little girl on Christmas morning",

  "post_message": "Just visited your store in Wallace Street  Stirling  and I ve got to say  I am appalled at the level of customer service I just received from the member of staff on till 17.   Said member of staff made no attempt to chat  being from a background in customer service  this is a vital aspect of any customer facing role  and really makes a difference to the experience from the consumers view.   Said member of staff was too interested in staring at their own hands and picking the skin around their nails to engage in even  I assume  essential  Tesco  chat. I wasn t asked if I had a clubcard  I handed this to the member of staff and it was promptly snatched out my hands  scanned and thrown back to me  I wasn t asked if I needed any bags  on this occasion I did need to purchase a 5p bag  so had to ask for this. Price of my shop was rudely grunted at me  with no eye contact  and hand held out in anticipation for money. I asked to pay by card and again was grunted approval of this.   There was no thank you  no see you later  nothing  there was nothing...   As a company working mainly in customer service  I feel certain members of your direct customer facing team need vast improvement and training on their skills.   I am not asking for a full life story and to find out what the member of staff serving me had for dinner on Monday last week and where they are off on holidays next year  but I do feel it would equate to a much more pleasant shopping experience  if your staff at least tried to engage with their customers. I appreciate everyone has bad days  days they don t want you talk to people  they may be ill  be suffering from personal issues or potentially just had a right rollicking from a senior member of staff  but unfortunately  from my experience  when you are serving customers  especially face to face  you have to push this aside.   I m not going to say I won t shop here again  I know I will  leading a busy life and with the shop mere moments from my front door  I do lean towards the convenience  I can only hope next time I spend money in your store  the next member of staff who serves me will be a vast improvement on the last.",

  "post_message": "Have you stopped selling hatchimals in store because no customers were getting them? We ve been lied to repeatedly about delivery dates by Tesco Kidderminster. At the beginning of November  we were told that the store has non food deliveries Friday night/ Saturday morning and Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. The woman on customer services even checked the expected delivery contents of the delivery expected that night and showed us that they were anticipating a small number of the toys. We got to the store at 00:05 and asked a woman on the shop floor to check the delivery for us (it had clearly been delivered as they were unpacking it in the aisles) and she said that had nothing had been delivered for the toy section at all and that they don t get toy deliveries on Friday nights and that it would be Monday at the earliest. So we found the woman from customer services and told her what had happened. She apologised and said that the manager of the of the toy department had confirmed they were expecting a delivery on that night.  She offered to get us the night manager but by this point it was nearly 01:00 and and we wanted to go home.  Monday morning we go in and asked if any Hatchimals had been delivered overnight in the delivery. We were told that the store didn t have non food deliveries on Sunday night/Monday morning.   We left it a couple of weeks. Last week  we asked customer services if any had been delivered. The woman told us that they had had one delivered in the previous week  but the best day to ask would be Wednesday because that s delivery day. We told her about what had happened earlier in the month so she rang the warehouse and they confirmed that non food deliveries -including toys - were Friday night/Saturday morning and Tuesday night/Wednesday morning.  Last Wednesday  my dad goes in at 04:50  en route to work  and asks if any had been delivered. He got told that they don t have deliveries for toys on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning and to try Friday.  My dad goes in Friday  as suggested  and asks if any Hatchimals had been delivered. The person on customer services says that Friday isn t a delivery day and that he should have come in Wednesday as they had a delivery in the night because that s their toy delivery date and they had DEFINITELY had some delivered.  Now  in the grand scheme of things  not being able to get a toy is hardly the end of the world. Would it be nice to be able to get one? Of course it would  but nobody is going to die and the world is going to carry on spinning. However  the lying is not acceptable. I suspect the staff were probably witholding them and your withdrawal from stores will probably remedy this  but why feel the need to lie in the first place? If they weren t doing anything wrong  then surely there wasn t a need to lie to us and lead us along?  It would be less infuriating if the journey to the store wasn t a 10 mile round trip  or if the mistake had only happened once.",

I got to work and was about to open them when I was shocked to see a strand of hair enclosed in the sealed packet. I think there has been some slack in the quality control process. Not only was i disappointed and felt sick to my stomach  my colleagues also thought it was disgusting. Please see attached the photos. I hope something will be done about this  not what I would expect from Tesco.",

She couldn t have put me more at ease and even tried to converse with my son. Unfortunately due to being stressed I didn t get her name but she has dark hair and was manning customer services at 6.10pm.

I cut my finger and obviously now need to arrange for a replacement/top segment. I would have thought the package would have been labelled handle with care due to the black glass material that was used for the top. I think you should contact the delivery company as I handled the stand with care and only moved it two feet from where it was delivered.  Can someone get back to asap in regards to getting a replacement sent out.   This is the second Black Friday I have used Tesco direct and the first was a nightmare.  Regards  Kial",

  "post_message": "Well Tesco  where do I start? To say I am disappointed is an understatement!  I ordered a gift for my friends little boy on 17th Nov  the email stated it would be delivered 19th Nov! I then received a text and email advising me that the product was in store! I went to the store (Falkirk) on the 20th Nov with my 3 month old baby (with temp -2) outside to be advised it was not in the store! The lady checked other stores nearby just in case but said no  not in any store!  I called cust serv on the 21st Nov  the lady advised me this was a courier error! She said she could either refund or re order  was this was for a gift I asked for it to be re ordered  she guaranteed me it would be in the store the following day (22nd Nov)! This wasn t the case!!  I received an email on the 23rd Nov advising me it would be delivered on the 26th Nov!  Today I went to the store to collect and guess what.... no parcel there! The lady kindly checked and told me it was at FennyLock (which I ve never heard off)! So back home I go (again having to waste petroleum  time and taking my baby out the house in cold weather)   I phone customer services (the guy on the phone sounded like he couldn t care less) told me that this was unsuccessfully delivered to the store but didn t know why! I advised this is the 2nd time this has happened (I can t understand as it s a 24 hour store) and asked to speak to complaints department!  I then speak to a lady (turned out the guy hadn t done a warm transfer) who I had to tell my story to again  she advised oh I am not the right person to be dealing with this and put me through to another guy (this time doing a warm handoff)! He advised me that he didn t think he was the right person either  so I explain my story again (for the 3RD time)! He then says he can only apologise and will order the goods again! I advised him this is the first and last time I will use Tesco online and could I complain! He advised me Tesco do not have a complaints department (which I find VERY hard to believe) but he gave me a customer journey email address (yes it will outline my journey but won t resolve my complaint)! I asked the guy when my product would be in store  he couldn t tell me and said it will be on your email  but normally takes 2 days to arrive but can take longer! So after 40 minutes on the phone and speaking to 3 different people my complaint has not been resolved so the only other option is go to social media! So Tesco I am looking for the following: - why on 2 occasions has my parcel been undelivered to a 24 hour store? - why is there no complaints department? - how are you going to restore me as a customer shopping with you again? - what are you doing about my inconvenience? - what are you doing to ensure my perception arrives in the store?   I look forward to hearing from you soon  failure to do so I will be taking this further!  Thanks",

I will not bore you with all the details but it has been a very long 4 weeks with lots of phone calls to and throw. Real shame that throughout this process one of your Tech staff were very rude on 2 separate occasions and spoke to me like something on the bottom of his shoe !  It s a shame it took over 4 weeks to get a replacement ( not able to collect until Thursday)  but certainly wouldn t want any other customer enduring this process again with Samsung and the number of let downs we went through. Definitely needs improving on that side of things with Samsung.  Thank you Phil again though and thanks for all your help .",

Today (29/11/2016) at 6pm my partner went to collect the weekly shop from your click and collect colletts drive Cheltenham. However disaster soon arose when we realised to our horror half our shopping was missing! Especially the toilet rolls cos come on have you had two toddlers and no toilet roll??? We briefly considered calling in MI5 batman iron man or even Darth Vader.... But instead we sufficed with an amaze balls duty manager called James Williams who was our superhero! He went above and beyond to find what happened to our shopping.... After determining that it had not been abducted by aliens  held hostage or held under protest it was in fact determined the packer  forgot  half the printed list (he or she was obviously pre engaged with end of the world matters and the survival dynamic as a whole).. Any way James in his super cape had a van to us within the hour with said missing items and even magicked up a box of choccies for the problems we faced. The customer service we faced was of super cape standard and may you long keep it up!!!  #tesco",

  "post_message": "So  after a extensive look on the interwebs to find a good deal for the Xbox one game battlefield  1 the Tesco extra in Blackpool was the place which did not indicate out of stock!  Yo Tom  fancy some maccies and a trip to Tesco?  Tom replies   mate  after all the shots last night you would be a life saver but don t drive like a loon  bowels aren t the best!  And off we pop! We had a lovely date at maccies ordering our scran and taking the biscuit out of all the cretins in the restaurant even though we looked pretty sketty ourselves. As we get to Tesco all is well  there are copies of battlefield 1 on the shelves  also the price! Fantastic I thought  I shall have much fun when I get home shooting people in the ham flower! Only when we took the box to the checkout and the lady went to get the game she came back with the worst news!  I m sorry we are out of stock! . I was most annoyed with an almighty  oooohhhh nnnnnooooo! . What made it more annoying is that the woman that served us said and I quote  we should of put an  out of stock  sticker on shouldn t we? . This I find is unacceptable  and thought I would share this uplifting but then soul destroying experience with you! You have just contrabuted to 7 miles of emmisions from my car for this error!

Called and turns out they won t be getting anymore stock and that s that! Had a sleepless night worrying about it. Called customer services and was told to visit the store as it s up to their discretion. I visited the store which is not near me at all! And was advised all they could do was let me spend the \u00a352 voucher on toys on their store. I didn t want any toys I wanted the paw patroller I had paid for and expected to collect at some point! They were unwilling to offer me cash or let me spend the voucher on other areas of the store. I visited the small toy isle and there was nothing either of my children would be interested in!  I only want a paw patroller!!! I now have a useless \u00a352 voucher and no paw patroller + so I don t disappoint my son Christmas Day I m going to have to go buy 1 in another shop for \u00a360+!!! I work part time and cannot afford this sort of unplanned spend. I thought I had a paw patroller in the bag for Christmas morning. Now I am having unnecessary stress purely because Tesco messed up!",

Called because the app seems to think I wanted my groceries for tomorrow in pre-booked Christmas slot. Unbeknownst to me the customer service (Joanne who apparently is the top boss over there \ud83d\ude44  please tell me another lie) tells me that  she couldn t possible change the order back to it s original slot (from 5-10 mins ago).   Could she call the store (that would be Musselburgh) and explain for me.....ABSOLUTELY NOT. That would be a firm no as well.   So basically your app is poor and now I get no food tomorrow or the Christmas slot. BRILLIANT!!!  Please listen to the call (I asked her to repeatedly record it). Where Joanne and Rachael basically didn t try to ease the situation but made it worse (pretty much a   what not to do in a call centre customer service environment)",

  "post_message": "I have always been an avid Tesco shopper. Not because it is better value than anyother store as I think many of the main supermarkets are very much of a muchness.  But for the convenience  it has always been a shop I know and can pop in and out very quickly. Unfortunately today has been a sad day for me. I visited your Long eaton shop to find disorder. I understand that you have felt the need to add more clothes stores which many people I am sure are happy about. What I am unsure about is that I would have thought your main line was as a food provider. This it would appear has unfortunately taken a slip here.  People are struggling to find anything in your store. I am aware that you have had to reshuffle things about to make way for the new clothes but please please could I make just 3 suggestions. 1) Please change the overhead signs so they are actually correct (I for one struggled to understand why Clingfilm and foil is stored on the pet food isle it took me ages to work that one out??) I know there were small signs on the isles telling people where things now are but those seem to have disappeared. 2) Give out a floor plan to your shoppers so that they know where everything now is. 3) Make sure all your staff know where everything is and are happy to show people. This I would have thought was a given but today it took me 3 people to ask before I found out where the cling fulm was. The 1st person wanted to moan about how they had no idea why they were having to change everything around (apparently their not paid for that  something I really didnt want to know) and the 2nd person didn t have a clue.   I hate to moan but maybe a little more pre thinking and organisation would have been better.  I hate to say it but my next shop may well be Asda  if I have no clue where anything is at Tesco anymore I might as well give Asda a shot as many people have recommended them to me and now I don t feel any need to be loyal as I dont need thus hassle  shopping is stressful enough when I know where everything is.",

To add insult to injury so to speak I ve found out that you actually require that the disposed of food in crushed in the bags! Why is this ? So the homeless or those in need don t go looking in the bins? It is such a shame that supermarkets don t utilise there waste food and give it to those who need it. If you can t legally sell it  the food to you is already wasted and so Is the profit  but someone could have it   someone may eat that day and not starve  someone could be given the calories to survive these cold nights.

I bought all 3 kids shoes for September and less than a term into wearing them Ivana had worn through at the bottom and stitching broken at the back  Jack and Theodore s shoes were worn down and split underneath  you could clearly feel the square supports underfoot and the velcro was coming up on both sets. I guess there is no saving money by going for cheap shoes. I have had to buy 3 new pairs of shoes now... I ve gone for Clark s and put the receipt safe this time!",

I put in an order for a gazebo to keep two primary school choirs dry if the weather turns during our charity event on Friday.  It said it would be delivered within 2-5 days. Once I had clicked through and paid  it changed its delivery time to 8 days! Thats 3 days after the event so useless to me. I understand that you are dealing with a lot of black friday orders  but please  please ensure your website gives the correct details! Changing a delivery date after payment is  unethical at best and probably illegal.  To make it worse  when I clicked through to cancel  it wouldn t let me click the  give a reason  button and wouldn t let me cancel the order without clicking it. So when I desperately need to be finding a gazebo elsewhere  from a company who will deliver when they say they will  I had to spend time on your automated phone system  then waiting to speak to a manager because your call centre staff said a refund wouldn t clear for 3-5 days!

  "post_message": "Hi  I ve just been to your Tesco Extra store in Pool  Cornwall to return a pack of boys school socks which were originally purchased for when my son started school in September 2015.        I bought the correct size for his measured feet only to find  after trying on a pair at home  that they were absolutely massive.              I didn t  unpack  any more of them and decided to put them to one side for him to grow into and purchased another pack in the smaller size on my next visit.           He has now outgrown/worn out of the smaller ones so I got the larger pack out of the draw. Again they were still really big even though his feet have obviously grown a lot.                                        I cut the rest of the packaging (the plastic bits that hold all of the pairs together) off of the pack this weekend only to discover that there were 2 different sizes in the pack. On closer inspection there were actually 3 different sizes!!! (Even though they all say the same size in them!)                                                                                    Obviously he needs more than a couple of pairs that fit to see him through the week which is why I went to return them today and hopefully end up with 1 pack (7 pairs) of all the same size socks.                  First of all the lady on customer service desk disputed the obvious size differences but said if I wasn t happy then to go and get another pack.                                                                                  On returning with a pack of socks she started shaking her head at me. The reason for this was that there were no socks there that resembled the school socks that I was returning - the only grey school socks were ribbed and only had 5 pairs in the pack (2 pairs less - which I was prepared to accept).                                                                                               So due to not having kept the receipt or the outer cardboard packaging (for over a year and not realising the socks weren t all the same size)  she said they couldn t exchange them and that was the end of it.           I understand that not having the receipt or barcode makes things more difficult but the socks all have  F&F  in them with the size and obviously haven t been worn.                                                                                                                             I would be extremely grateful if someone could help me with this matter as when I purchased the original pack  I did not receive a complete pack of the same size socks as stated.   Regards  Helen x",

  "post_message": "So Tesco remove messages instead of replying with an answer when they do not like what you say to them.  In view of the fact that your company emailed my daughter allegedly by you as a priority customer the slots for booking Christmas Eve delivery and she could not get a slot because you say YOU DONT DELIVER XMAS EVE which meant she missed out on an earlier slot for her xmas shop.  There is nothing you can do it was an error.  What a disgraceful way to treat loyal customers who spend a lot of money with you on a weekly basis.  It is difficult for her to get to the other side of Lincoln with three young children and being pregnant with her third which is why she uses online shopping.  Your customer services have solved nothing in this case and all you have done is removed my opinion.  Is that the best you can do. really???",

It is a very nasty preservative responsible for allergies of an epidemic scale!! I have a bottle at home which is  free-from  but on Sunday I looked at the label in-shop and saw the dreaded word. The only alternatives (there are only two free of MI) are either over \u00a31 or \u00a32 which is a bit rubbish seeing as your own costs under 50p!!  Please  Google  this allergy. It is very nasty and often affects people who have never suffered from sensitive skin. It is essentially a poison and can cause nerve damage and digestive problems as well as the classic skin/ mucous membrane problems....It is basically a cheaper alternative whose use should be restricted to paint and industrial lubricants. However it is now put into cosmetics and even in baby products....",

  "post_message": "So today I was sat there waiting for my weekly shopping delivery off tescos when I recived a phone call off the delivery driver to say he is outside my house only it s the wrong adress! I ve recently moved and totally forgot to change the adress with everything going on plus my 6month old son has been poorly! The driver said that usually what would happen is that I would have to re order my shopping to get delivered again  but the money wouldn t go back in my account for 3 days! My heart sank as I spent up the last of my money on the shopping and I don t get paid until Wednesday. The delivery driver said that as he could see I ordered baby food and nappies he would phone his boss and see what he could do (this was without me explaining my situation) he then phoned back and asked me for my adress. This lovely man then came and delivered my shopping still with a huge smile on his face even though it was completely out of his was for his next job! I would like to say a huge thank you and for this man to get some recognition as I know for some it might not seem huge but for me it s made a massive difference between being ok and struggling until Wednesday. I have recently just bought a house and I  have a 6 month old so maternity pay is far from great it hasn t been easy  but this man s act of kindness has made a huge difference so thank you to the tescos delivery driver from walkden tescos you ve made my day!

  "post_message": "What do I have to do to make a complaint about my local Tesco and have it taken seriously? Food  which should be refrigerated is left out for long periods while other non-refrigeration items are shelved in order of priority (Weird!!). I have photo evidence of this. Then there is a person on checkout about whom I have had cause to complain more than once. He packs bags with soft items being crushed beneath heavier items making some foods look inedible. What s the point of purchasing nicely presented foods in nice packaging if they re going to be squashed into a lump of slop when I reach home?! This evening I went to the sane store with a friend who bought a Tesco Finest Chicken Madeira. This stupid individual (I can only imagine) must have thought it clever to scan the barcode and then flip the item several times before placing it in a bag resulting in the item being entirely spoiled. I was furious at this! Why is this person still employed by Tesco??!! Other staff have commented too about him and his slack attitude. Somehow I will find a way to go very public about this store. I m not kidding either!!",

Went to collect today from click and collect to find that 1 part of the order was actually 2 quilts 2 pillows and 2 bins. As you can imagine I was annoyed. Phoned customer service to be told that 1 of the toys was now out of stock. Said that you will set me up for stock alerts but no guarantee this would be before Christmas or a refund so went for the refund. Said you would refund me the monies for that item to look at my emails to see that you are only refunding me half the price as I was now not eligible for the 3 for 2. Furious is not the word can t get the toy anywhere else and not having 3 for 2 plus expecting me to wait in 7am till 7pm on my only day off work for a courier to collect the parcel that was incorrectly sent by yourselves. Absolute shambles I have order lots from tesco but can say you have lost my custom and will be telling friends and family about my experience #unhappycustomer",

I got really excited when it said guaranteed to last the festive period and thought to myself what could go wrong ! 4 days later it s dying on me \ud83d\ude10. I know it likes the warm   so I ve had the heating on for it and when it was starting to look sorry for itself I plonked in front of the fire but it s still giving up on me . As for water if I give it anymore it s either gonna drown or I m going to cause a drought in winter and if I m not careful the waterboard will be looking for an underground leak . One friend Karen Mycroft accused me of pre-meditated murder but I can assure you I bought this plant with good intentions ! Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep this plant alive so it can at least see one happy Christmas ?

After a couple more phone calls of them having no idea where my shopping is and no explanation they asked me to re-schedule.( baring in mind we do our shop for every Sunday  so we have no food or anything in the house. ) I have been advised to re-schedule but not helpful to me  I decided to cancel my whole shop because I am disappointed with the service that I have had to deal with today  I have never had a problem before so I am very disappointed.

Shopping yesterday with my 10 month old in the trolley  all was well and I thought she might fall asleep on the way round. However  as I picked up the last item on my list she began crying  I picked her up for a cuddle but this did not appease her. She wanted only one thing  and that was to be breastfed. Now  I m not particularly shy or bothered about feeding in public  but with her show down she had created quite an audience. Non the less  I pulled my trolley over to the end of the frozen aisle and began feeding hoping she d be quick and I wouldn t be in anyone s way. After about two minutes I looked up to see a few members of staff approach me  as if reading my mind they offered me to get me a chair to sit down on so I could continue feeding her in comfort. I was so pleased I could have cried! Not only for the chair  but for the acknowledgement and acceptance of normalizing breastfeeding in public! Well done Tesco!

Once I arrived at the store my 5 year old son spent 10 minutes deciding which one he wanted before we made our way to the self service till to complete our purchase. Having queued for 5minutes it was our turn next  scanned product and it came up on the till unrecognised item. The assistant came across  who then called someone else over to find the code to put it through the till. We were left waiting a further 10minutes for the assistant to return to tell us that they are unable to sell us the \u00a318 iPad case as it won t scan on the till.  If you have children you will understand how upset my son was that he couldn t buy the item he wanted and the fact that we had spent 10 minutes waiting for some to come to the conclusion that we just couldn t by it. The Tesco staff in the store didn t seem interested in making the customer happy or in fact that the were losing a sale. I don t understand why you have products on sale if you won t sell them.  We returned home minus a case  resulting in a iPad that is still unprotected  one very upset child  1hr of our time wasted and 10miles travelled for no reason.

Now I m here because the replacement has decided it no longer wants to turn on! Yes I know it is over the 12 month warranty  but let s face it  no one buys a TV and only expects it to last 15 months which means I m sure you ll agree this would not be classed as the TV lasting a reasonable length of time as the sale of goods act states it should. Hopefully this can be resolved quickly and easily or I ll have to consider setting my son up with his Ps4 using a display tv in our local Tesco store instead of my living room TV so that Tesco staff can better understand why this needs to be resolved!",

  "post_message": "Today I went into your superstore in Cheltenham and bought myself a packet of 20 Gluten free Chicken Nuggets and a Goodfellas Gluten free Pepperoni Pizza from the frozen aisle. These two everyday items cost me \u00a36.50. If I was to buy these items not gluten free it would have cost me \u00a33.00. So I want to ask you why am I being charged over twice as much for having to eat gluten free products? If you are unaware  eating Gluten Free means you have an auto-immune disease called Celiac Disease  eating Gluten when you have Celiac disease means your body attacks your small intestine and in turn damages your digestive track leading to both long and short terms health problems ranging from vomiting  cramping and excessive bathroom use  to lasting damage to your digestive track and an inability to absorb nutrients from foods. It is not a choice  nor is it a fad diet.  An average supermarket stocks 80 000 different lines  your frozen gluten free section is two bays wide. And yet these are the products you have chosen to charge an extortionate amount on knowing full well that if a person with Celiac disease wants the modern convenience of a frozen pizza or chicken nuggets  they will have no choice but to spend over twice as much.   This not only goes for Gluten Free products  but also Lactose free and other items that you stock that adhere to people with food intolerances and allergies. Please explain to me why I feel like I am being discriminated against over a health issue I have no control over.",

  "post_message": "I m not one for having a moan at all but I have to say just how shockingly awful the service is in the Tesco in Watford. Made a special visit there today  battled the ques to get in and park kids in tow went to buy a tablet in the black Friday offer qued to pay with my clubcard  I wanted to use the money towards my purchase only to be told that i needed the voucher printed. So lost my place in the que went to find the printer machine... it was out of order ... asked the customer service lady what can be done? Her reply ... nothing. There is nothing tesco could do to help. The machine had been offline since last night and wasnt working. When i explained that wasnt my fault and asked if they could help me find another way round it i was told  go ask over there  so again i went to ask somebody else if they could help and was told to go home and print them myself. GREAT STUFF! Now bearing in mind our family spend thousands of pounds a year in that shop on our groceries and homeware AND the fact that I had the clubcard in hand I find it absolutely obsurd that no one was willing to help. I am appalled at the system or lack of systems that you have in place.  One machine that if it breaks in the biggest event of the year there isn t a back up or an alternative route to help your customers. So with two young children and one wasted journey I feel truly disappointed. Tesco can have all the high tech fruit smoking machines and expensive posh bakerys in the world but what matters most to a business like yours is providing excellent customer service and I m afraid to say Tesco Watford doesn t.",

  "post_message": "We went to your West Durrington store today  aiming to do a full food shop.  Unfortunately less than half way round my son filled his nappy which was unpleasant for him  us and anyone passing him.  So we had to make the decision between changing him on your toilet floor (grim) and finishing our food shop or paying for the few bits we had managed to collect and leaving to go home and changing him.  Pretty obvious which option we picked. So today when we would have spend over \u00a3100 in your shop we ended up spending less than \u00a330.  We also would have stayed and had something to eat and drink in Costa Coffee but we couldn t because my son was so upset at being in a dirty nappy we had no choice but to leave. Shame really that you fail to provide better facilities so that he could have had the dignity you and I have and we could have cleaned him up and carried on our day instead of having to cut our trip short and return home where we will now probably stay for the rest of the day because its just easier not to go out. You provide toilets for all your other customers  men  women  children and babies  this store has a large disabled toilet as well.  Yet none of these were suitable for my son (or his friends who live locally) because he is 7 and is severely disabled so your baby changing table is far too small to hold his weight.   Please consider providing an adult sized changing table and a hoist to aid with lifting so that next time we can simply pause our shop and carry on our visit afterwards just like everyone else does.  This would benefit a huge number of people in and around the Worthing area who shop in Tesco - or who don t currently because of the lack of facilities but would like to.",

I emailed to complain this morning  only to recieve a reply saying that Tesco are not doing deliveries on Christmas eve. ***This is not what your email states*** Really Tesco  what is going on?!? and now it is even too late to book a delivery slot for the 23rd or even the 22nd of December. The lady who replied to my email  even suggested that i try and select click and collect. I am a pregnant mother with 3 children at home and Tesco is the other side of my town  therefore this is not an option!  We have our shopping delivered weekly from Tecso but this is seriously making me want to shop elsewhere from now on!  I would like a delivery slot allocating to me  given that I ve been given false and misleading information and if it can t be on the 24th  then it needs to be the evening of the 23rd  or another supermarket will be getting my custom.  Thanks.",

  "post_message": "Well Tesco  I was very much looking forward to my Chicken Korma last night but I finished my meal very disappointed. A Korma is normally yellowish in colour and very coconutty. This jar of own brand \u201cKorma\u201d bared just about no resemblance to what any normal person would call a Korma. The easiest way to describe the jar contents is like this. Imagine the mildest curry you can get from the chip shop and then add a pinch of coconut. The colour matched greeny chip shop curry to an art  but it wasn t chip shop curry I wanted. I wanted yellowie  coconutty  slightly creamy Korma.  Who ever you had doing the taste test on this one must have obviously been given the wrong the wrong curry to taste. Thoroughly disappointed and I will not be buying it again! Hopefully the jar of \u201cButtery Chicken\u201d is as it should be or I ll be back here with more disappointment.",

Firstly  I would like to point out my annoyance at the fact that your Belfast Metro store does not accept contactless payments or PayQwiq despite this sign on every self service till in the store. This evening I went to purchase some items using PayQwiq and if it had not have been for my boyfriend  then I would have been left sad and without my 4 bars of chocolate (yes 4  don t judge me). It was rather frustrating as I like the ease of not having to bring my purse out with me all the time since I can use your app.",

After twenty minutes we left and went to your Batley store instead (not very convenient but we needed to get our shop).  I was appalled at the state of the shelves. More than 30 tins (7 different types) were displayed in disarray  dented  damaged and some leaking.  Disgraceful! Shop management should be ashamed! We couldn t buy everything we wanted due to shelves being empty or items too damaged.  Not good. Next time we can t park in Brighouse we will shop at Sainsbury s across the road instead.",

  "post_message": "Dear Tesco   Being a proud home-owner  I enjoy the fragrant scent offered by reed diffusers and you do have a lovely range. But I m disappointed to tell you I ve now wasted 40 mins  and cut several of my fingers  attempting to remove the plastic plug from the bottle of one of your White Grace reed diffusers. The instructions state to merely  remove the plastic plug from bottle   but it appears the bung has been pushed into the bottle tighter than a sealed vault. Coupled with this  the fact that attempting to prise the bung from the bottle starts to release small amounts of the oil and causes the whole thing to become more slippery than the frost-covered roads this morning  I feel like I m attempting the type of challenge one sees on a TV game show - designed for the contestant to never win. I ve tried a knife - hence the cut fingers  keys  a metal nail file & my bare hands. I still cannot remove the plug from the bottle to enjoy the wonderful fragrance (though I do now have nice-smelling keys). I m relatively strong and deadlifting 97kg at the gym this morning to be frank  took nowhere near as much effort & was not as exhausting as attempting to open this bottle. Can you possibly please offer some advice?",

This has changed in the last few weeks while trying to get a Hatchimals. While I understand that there is a high demand for this toy I would like you to tell me how it s fair that even when you get a delivery of them they are not even making it to your shelves for the customer to buy!! On 3 separate occasions in 3 different stores I have being told that you are expecting a delivery but basically they have been taken by delivery drivers or staff before they even make it onto the shop floor. This included 2 late night trips into your stores. Now I know staff are entitled to some perks but surely it s unfair for this to keep happening so that customers don t even have a chance to buy this toy. Come Christmas morning my daughter and niece are going to be very disappointed that Santa couldn t deliver them this toy due to the probable greed of some of your staff. Fair enough if they are buying them for their children but I hope they are only allowed to buy 1 which seems to be the policy of a lot of stores.",

It has just been renewed and looks very nice  and the bread is of a very high standard as opposed to the other Tesco in the area.  Unfortunately you have decided to display the fresh bread unwrapped straight on the shelf.  Saw several people coughing and sneezing on it  and one person after having quite a hacking cough into his hands  pick a bloomer up  then put it back.  Surely hygiene has to be in question.  It s not like you can wash bread as you do fruit and veg  and it is the height of the cold and flu season.  I personally won t be buying fresh bread from your store until it is wrapped again  Andy I know a few Didsbury locals who won t be either.

You put great emphasis on looking after your customers but I don t see any behaviour that supports it from yourself.   1. I bought a shopping online nearly 2 weeks ago and it was supposed to be delivered. The delivery man rang and I literally missed his call by less than 20 seconds. I tried to call back straight away and there was no answer  I tried calling several times and got not response.  I contacted you by phone and the fella told me that he doesn t need to pick up the phone!  I have a problem with that  firstly your staff are making all the effort to go around the warehouse/ store to pick up the ingredients. Then putting them into a basket for the driver  the drivers drives all the way to us and then he is too lazy to make an effort and is not obliged to pick up the phone. He ll drive all the way back and the stuff is put back  I don t know what you are considering saving money. But if you do that with every customer  it wouldn t surprise me if your going to losse money because of the laziness of your staff. (Btw everytime I go into a tesco there is at least one problem that I can point out to you)  Anyway  I m also being told that I will be refunded the full amount.

So after a long and very disagreeable conversation with your customer services I now have to wait up to ten days to get the vouchers resent to me so I can use them again. So not only did I lose my confirmed order but also my clubcard vouchers which I had to phone and chase to get back. Sort yourselves out Tesco. Not impressed.",

I m thinking we could use this idea for even more - for our hardworking older generation  many of which have nobody and nothing at all. Year after year I have seen respectable people who have worked all their lives  yet don t have any family or money and are sat in the cold dark lounge on their own. Anything such as sachets of hot chocolate/Horlicks  marmalade  jam  biscuits  slippers  socks  warm pyjamas  scarves  tissues  handkerchiefs  toiletries... it would all help. I am looking to put together some packages which will be handed out by our local branch of Contact The Elderly to vulnerable elderly people at their Christmas get togethers.  Anybody who is interested in getting involved don t hesitate to give me a message  it would be really appreciated. \u2764\ufe0f\ufe0f\ud83c\udf84\ud83d\udc74\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc75\ud83c\udffb",

I did them a favour saying the pork is off and the lady that served me had so much attitude and hate ... she made me feel like I was lying about the pork being off ( she did not smell or touch the pork I returned!)  Didn t even say sorry and I had to ask for the refund!  Huh Tesco says they value this and that well they don t value their customers that s for sure!!  Very disappointed",

  "post_message": "I m pretty annoyed.. tonight me and my best friend tried to buy some NON alcoholic  Champaign  and grenadine  so we could make Mocktails  it s for my 22nd birthday - I m pregnant so can t drink alcohol  and we thought that mocktails would be a good substitute. This was an idea we came up with after I had been let down for some prior plans the same day  so I was looking forward to it.   Unfortunately. You apparently have to have I.D for Non alcoholic items too!! I had mine in my purse but my friend didn t  so we were refused. The lady seemed confused and called over another member of staff over too ask if we really needed I.D for non alcoholic items. She was very blunt even after I explained it s for my birthday and I m pregnant etc etc. (By the way I m quite obviously pregnant as I m 23 weeks with a big bump)   The lady on the till then said do you want the rest of your stuff  the bar kit (with plastic cocktail glasses and straws etc) and some juices (orange juice etc) we took a minute to decide as I was wondering if it was worth it without the grenadine (as that s what gives it a cocktail feel) we decided to purchase the rest of our items  the lady then proceeded to slam our receipt on top of our shopping quite rudely.   I m honestly very angry about all this  I think it s ridiculous that we should need our I.D for non alcoholic drinks. I d like to know why firstly... I ve never seen a law anywhere that says I.D is required for NON alcoholic drinks (beer wine champagne).   Thanks for ruining my only plans I had left for my birthday  and the very rude service we received for absolutely no reason at all. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

I m going to have a moan at you on here as I ve moaned at you on Twitter and nobody has listened over there (I m hoping that whoever looks after your Facebook page is better than the folk running your Twitter). Anyway  here goes... like a lot of folk I m quite partial to a nice bottle/can of craft ale and regularly visit your Thirsk store to replenish my stocks. Annoyingly  whoever decides where the aforementioned ale resides on your shelves clearly doesn t know what they re doing as it s spread over no less than three different areas in the aisle (some with the lager  some with the beer and (most bizarrely) some with the alcopops. This makes keeping track of what you have in stock a bit of a challenge and could mean that folk are missing out on the fine examples brewing that you have in stock (particular kudos for the Brooklyn East IPA). Is there any chance you could rustle up a dedicated craft ale section on your shelves - it can t be too tricky as other (not to be named) competition seem to be able to manage. It would make my life a lot easier and would probably mean you d sell more beer too. Cheers (literally and metaphorically) \ud83c\udf7b",

One manger who I will refer to as  Chris  picked it up and asked the other store manager who I believe is  steve   have you seen this new cheese? It s expensive  I can tell you now that won t sell in Brownhills  ...now that ladies and gentlemen is class discrimination at its finest (excuse the pun) surely as managers they are given training in how not to discriminate?? I will say  while Steve didn t pull chris up on his discriminative manor  he didn t agree with him either he just said  you never know  . My point to this post is  even if the cheese won t sell to us Brownhills folk at least give us the courtesy of keeping your opinion private! I do believe if it wasn t for us Brownhills people shopping at the store you wouldn t have your job there!!! Am I correct??? #thinkbeforeyouspeak",

My time is very precious and I do not appreciate having to wait for nearly an hour for the 24 hour shop to open. It is my birthday and as a treat to myself I wanted to get my food shopping done before getting the children up  doing the school runs and going to work. You have foiled my plan by closing a 24 hour functioning store. Like I said to the lovely store assistant (through the massive metal shutters)  I don t care if it s Black Friday or green Tuesday  this is not on. I have to go to some serious lengths to shop on my own and I thought I was in for a right treat. It s not on Tesco. I am very disappointed in you.",

He is a lovely guy and super helpful and every year happy to have a photo with our girls so they can see over the years that santander really is real and working in tesco in hucknall Nottingham.

As we got to the checkout  his temperature spiked  his face turned completely white and his lips blue and he began to vomit.

I want to say a massive thank you to your staff who were absolutely amazing. First aiders were immediately alerted  an ambulance called and reassurance given all so quickly. We were taken to a private room to give us some space and were offered and given literally anything and everything. Your care  kindness and generosity is something I cannot thank you enough for. You were all amazing and deserve recognition for going above and beyond.  I only caught the names of three people  Nick  Nicky and Sharon but please pass on my thanks to everyone who assisted us. Joey appears to have had a febrile convulsion due to his high temperature and has low blood sugar. He is still very poorly but is now tucked up fast asleep.

My partner has just been on a special trip to your Hattersley branch in search of a Chrome cast  after looking on your website to check if they had stock. It said there was stock there but on arrival he was told there were none but perhaps they were being delivered the next day which is why they were showing as in stock. There is no point I providing a stock checker on your website if the information is incorrect which then leads to a wasted journey.

It was not just one thing but a number of things to the point that it made me so mad and disappointed. I felt very let down from Tesco and their staff!  I decided I was paying at a till as I still love the face to face of customer service I normally get at Tescos! I waited for ages while the 2 sales assistants put through and bagged. 1 just had a terrible attitude didn t want to be there at all and when I finally go there he asked did I have a bag... I explained while stopping my son from doing his own merchandising and I popped my bag down told my son to stop and the sales guy tutted and just stood there not engaging at all with myself but finishing scanning was chatting to the other sale assistant  I passed my club card and he was angry to deal with it and muted under his breath the total and I paired by card he put the receipt on my bag and then went off before I even got my card out of the reader! I enjoy shopping in your stores but I will not be doing so for a while as I am totally disgusted with his attitude and shocking lack of customer service  if he is a long standing member of staff he needs updating on his understanding on customer service as today s events show he has no understanding and if he is new your standards for choosing staff is seriously low to the point if I do come back to shop at that store and there are more sales assistants like that I would be totally disappointed and never shop with you again I do not wish that to be an option I expected better from you and your sales assistants after all they are the face of Tesco s",

But I popped into the tesco petrol station yesterday to get a wrap  and they have changed and now have bacon. Not only that  every wrap and sandwich in there contained bacon or ham  except the chicken mayo  which has way too much mayo and is horrible.

We work really hard to make sure our daughters know there are no such things as boys toys and girls toys  and boys clothes and girls clothes - there are just toys and clothes  and they can play with and wear the things they like. So it frustrates me no end that  even on this small level  everyday sexism is prevalent across the child-focused aisles  and unravels what we re trying to do.  My daughters are already growing up in a world where they ll have to fight tooth and nail to be seen on an even footing in so many aspects of life. We re doing what we can as parents to arm them to fight against it - but please don t keep making it even harder for them by continuing this sort of gender division.",

  "post_message": "I m so upset right now after having to deal with Tesco Direct.  I placed on order on-line for the 3 for 2 offer and purchased 3 toys for my son on Saturday 19th November. I received an email to say all 3 items had been dispatched the next day  Sunday 20th. On Monday the 21st I then had a text to say 2 of the items were ready to collect  I thought I would wait for the 3rd to arrive and collect them all together.  By this morning I was getting a little concerned as I hadn t heard anything on the 3rd item so I called Tesco Direct  I was told that my item had definitely been dispatched and was just waiting to be collected from the warehouse. She than also said she was putting me on a stock alert as the item was out of stock in case my item didn t arrive. This set alarm bells ringing as if my item had definitely been dispatched why would it not arrive.  I went to my local store this afternoon to collect the 2 items that were waiting and discussed my concerns with the sales assistant who also seemed confused as if my item had been dispatched as stated on email and by the call centre staff  then it should have arrived. The sales assistant again called Tesco Direct to discuss my order. After a lengthy wait and being on hold it was confirmed my item was never dispatched as it is out of stock.  The item that is out of stock is the 1 present my son wants this year  other places had great deals on this item that weekend but as I was looking at other items with you it made great sense to benefit from the 3 for 2 offer.  The options I have been given is either stay on stock alert and hope it comes into stock or receive a refund for 1/2 the price of them item I haven t received which would then leave me out of pocket and have paid more than the other 2 items cost.   Item 1 cost \u00a371.24 (out of stock) Item 2 cost \u00a336.05 Item 3 cost \u00a328.49  I paid \u00a3107.29 which is the total of item 1 and 2 and the 3rd was free.   I have been offered which I think is disgusting that if the item 1 does not come back on stock I will get a refund of 1/2 the value which works out at \u00a335.62.  So not only through no fault of my own am I losing out on the 3 for 2 deal but I am also paying more than what the other 2 items were worth.  The total cost of item 2 and 3 is \u00a364.54 if you take that from the \u00a3107.29 I paid it leaves \u00a342.70. So why am I only getting a refund of \u00a335.62. Meaning I ve paid \u00a37.08 more than the 2 items I have received cost on the first place.  My money should not have been taken if the item was not available to be sold and now there s a good chance my son won t get the 1 thing he has asked for because it is out of stock everywhere.",

Today an older lady justified her parking in a parent and child bay by the fact that her husband has had a heart attack. Very sad indeed. But then she went on to say (when we suggested parking in the disabled bay)  that she couldn t park there cause she didn t have a disabled badge. Nevermind that... But the husband sat in the car waiting for her to do the shop. So did it really matter where the car was parked???  For me it isn t about the distance but the space around your car to be able to take your baby out of the car without being restricted by other cars parked next to you. Such a shame there is no solution to stopping people with no children from parking in the parent and child bays  :( Unless there is???",

To my surprise I was told these tablets can not be repaired!  So a \u00a390 tablet used very little and still under warranty now has to be thrown in the bin!!!  So please take this into account when buying for children   and maybe look at spending slightly more with a better company so these easily damaged parts  which normally cost very little won t end up costing you a new tablet \ud83d\ude21",

In the last 3 weeks I have made around 20 visits to this store in a desperate attempt to purchase a Hatchimals Toy for a Christmas gift  each time I was repeatedly told to return on the next delivery day and try again. Whilst I understand that this is a very popular toy this Christmas I certainly did not expect to hear what I did at 1am this morning!  I was told to return to store at 10pm (expected delivery time) by your main customer service call centre  upon this visit I was then told that the delivery was not expected for another couple of hours and if I really wanted to I could return at 1am thus giving the staff enough time to unload their delivery etc. When I returned at 1am I was quite rudely told that staff were unable to sell the item as they had a very long list of customers phone numbers to offer them to first! I was never informed of this procedure by any member of staff in this store over the 3 week period nor by your customer service team and find it rather disgusting that whilst every other store is providing them on a first come first served basis  this store seems to be making its own rules up!  Please could you clarify what company policy is on this issue??",

I ve had family members everywhere trying to source dairy free treats and food for my little boys first proper Christmas  and for a few items including a staple every child wants (advent calendar  chocolates  mince pies) it s almost costing as much as it is to feed our whole family on Christmas day.

  "post_message": "To Whom it May Concern    RE: Tesco Extra Sunbury   On 3rd November 2016 at around 19:20  I was a customer at your store  in Sunbury. Prior to entering your store  I was mugged of \u00a3250 at the cash point on your premises  for the use of your customers.   Upon being mugged  I ran inside and informed the security guard  who came outside  looked in the direction that the mugger ran and told me to call the police  without offering any support and to call them on my behalf or waiting with me whilst I called them. The security guard told me that he was new  and that he didn t know what to do  so was going to speak to the manager.   I called the police  with the support of a kind member of public  and they were there in good time  took DNA swabs  a full statement and were hopeful to obtain an outcome from either the DNA swabs from my hands or from your CCTV overlooking the cashpoint.   Considering I am a petite  22 year old young woman who was alone  I would have thought that a member of management or staff may have come out to ensure that I was okay  considering I was on your premises  using a service that you provide  with the intentions of purchasing products from this store. However  not one member of staff  asked if I was okay  offered me a drink or waited with me until the police arrived. Instead  I was left with strangers  all be it  they were luckily very kind members of the general public.   Following police investigation  today I have been informed by the police that the CCTV camera that I was relying on to provide some evidence  and show the crime being committed  does not record. The police have also informed me that management at this store said the CCTV cameras inside the building are the only ones that work  because they are for customer safety  implying that I was not a customer.   I am eager to know  why I was not a customer on that evening? I was using a service provided by Tesco at most  if not all of your stores  with every intention of using the store after I had withdrawn my money. As a local person  I would normally use your store on a regular basis  at least 3 times per week. But I am not a customer?  Since this event  I have only been to your store if accompanied  with the exception of day light hours. I did however  have to nip in to this store this evening  and on my way back to my car  which I parked close to the building  I became overwhelmed with panic and ended up running to my car and locking the doors.   I am aware that it is unlikely that the person who will find and respond to this message probably doesn t work in the stores  however I would like to know what is going to be done by Tesco  moving forward in order to protect myself and other customers (or non customers as Sunbury management believes) when using the store  or the services provided on the premises.   I look forward to your response.   Kind Regards  Megan Bardini",

The keys have those security tags on that set off the bleepers so why weren t they stopped? I ve had a email back siding with the staff which I knew the were going to do and a half hearted sorry  the manner in which she spoke left me upset and feeling like being disabled was my own fault and a hinderence to others.

They were similar on price  however  the number of bags used in their bagless delivery shocked us and we returned loyally to you. So imagine my sadness when this was tonight s bagless shop from you.  Each of those 7 green carriers  without exception  ONLY contained pre-packed vegetables or fruit. They are utterly superfluous. This is despite us asking for a bagless delivery and adding extra notes about not bagging items.  I know you don t charge for these (which is strange) when ordering online  but for us this has nothing to do with cost and I also realise that they are recycled and recyclable. Yet  they are also utterly redundant. It is a significant enough issue for us to change brands as evidenced above.  Please do better  it really matters to some of us.",

  "post_message": "I am interested in your views. As someone who cannot eat gluten I applaud your efforts to make a free from section in store.  I am however a little confused as to how you can sell gluten free chocolate hob nobs at \u00a33.50 for a pack containing 8 biscuits. Not only is this more than double the price of regular hob nobs  the actual biscuits are smaller! A similar comparison can be made with your gluten free beers and other products. It feels as if people like myself are penalised for wanting to enjoy your products that are safe for us to consume. Could you explain why gluten free products seem to carry a very expensive premium in your store?",

  "post_message": "i went to Tesco Ellon this morning - now last year when I was pregnant I fell at this time of year because the car park wasn t gritted... this morning  at 9.15am  I drove in  skidded getting in to a parent and child space  I then got my 8 month old son out of the car and nearly fell twice carrying him from car park space over to side of store to get a trolley.  We got back to the car safely but on driving out  heading down the slight hill towards the petrol station  there is a zebra crossing.  A very frail old man was waiting to cross and I hit the breaks  car went from 2nd gear to 1st  and wouldn t stop.  I had to pull my handbreak on  nearly hit a lamp post and did a 360 degree turn  with my baby in the car  in order to miss the old man due to black ice/  This is absolutely ridiculous.  I did speak to a member of staff  about it but was told that someone would be out soon to grit the area.  OK  but many elderly people like to get out early to do their shopping  never mind the likes of me who prefers to shop with a baby before its bus   and I find it extremely  irresponsible that Tesco do not have someone designated on these frosty days to ensure customers safety.  its not like its an irregular occurance at this time of year that there is ice.    I am a very loyal shopper but to be honest I will rethink where I shop due to the car parking situation for my and my baby s safety.  So shocked that this is yet another year and Tesco cant get their act together to get that car park safe.",

The garage manager came out and admitted that the plate wasn t mounted back correctly by maintenance. I luckily took pictues showing that it was not placed back on its base correctly. I filed a damage clain in store. Today I received a letter from Tesco saying that their technician checked it and said that it was in perfect working order. I returned to the car wash today and the spray plate has been reset correctly. Again I took pictures of it. Not happy about being lied to when they are clearly at fault. I will be filing a claim with county court on Monday.",

To add insult to injury this item was in the three for two and one of the more expensive items (\u00a333) so I said ok so your refunding the \u00a333 then I was met with no .. you will be paying full price for the item that again I have proof of purchase for and should of been and shows on the receipt as the free item as now (through no fault of my own one item is it if stock and I m not eligible for the 3 for 2 deal) so not only is one of my sons Christmas presents not arriving tomorrow but you also are refusing to refund me the full price of it .... if I had known this would of been the case I would of shopped elsewhere and will likely be doing so from now on .

As consumers we cant tell this until the first two bites ..   So either warn consumers they may be unripe when buying or work with your suppliers to help improve the ripening process.  When you eat an unripe astringent persimmon (American or Asian) the mouth immediately draws up. Sometimes you ll get a hint of sweetness (if it is near-ripe) but the mouth-feel is immediate.  I now know you can hasten ripening by leaving persimmons in a paper bag along with an apple  which produces extra ethylene to soften the fruit.

I said they re not they are only \u00a37 to which she replying well if they are not on file you can buy them. She snatched them out of the cashiers hand and walked off.   It was disgusting behaviour to be honest. No sorry no explanation just bad manners!   I then went to the customer service desk where the girl after leaving her post and going to check came back. Tried scanning them. Tried keying them in and apologies and explained that if they weren t on file then she couldn t sell them as their may or may not be a health and safety issue. Her manner was fantastic.  Leaving me with 2 unhappy but accepting children.    So my question is this. Can these animotsu large plush please be put on file so I can come and get them.",

I was bought a purse like this by a wee friend but I accidentally left it on the bus on the way home from my Uni placement last night and unfortunately it hasn t been handed in : ( I don t care about the money that was inside but I m gutted about the purse because the little lady who bought it for me asks me if I have it whenever I see her!  I really don t want to think about the sad look on her face when I tell her I lost it  so I m really hoping you might have one somewhere at Tesco Towers that I can buy!  Fingers crossed! x",

As I m sure many people understand  this time of year is the busiest for the members of the NHS and emergency services. What many people don t understand is that we may be expected to work for 12 hours without breaks if required. That s half a day without food  drink or even loo breaks. Yesterday  the local Tesco stores donated a large amount of mince pies to our ambulance station. These have been gratefully received  and have made many hungry paramedics very happy.  Thank you all and Merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84  Written by a colleague of mine but sent with my heartfelt thanks too.",

  "post_message": "At the moment I have 3 very disappointed granddaughters and am very disappointed myself with Tesco customer service!! My 10 year old granddaughter was lucky enough to win a family cinema ticket to see the new Trolls movie at our local Tesco extra in Pool Redruth Cornwall. At the time of entering we didn t realise that there was no odeon cinemas in Cornwall and that if she was lucky enough to win she would need to travel well over a 100 miles to take up the prize. She was delighted when her mum received the email telling her that they had won but imagine her disappointment when they looked to see where the nearest odeon was Exeter or Taunton!! Practically up country to us way down in Cornwall!! So I phoned Pool Tesco today and spoke to a very nice man who tried his best to help with changing the tickets but unfortunately it was out of his control and gave me the number for your head office customer service. Unfortunately the lady there was not so helpful!! She said she was sorry that my granddaughter was upset but it was an odeon promotion and out of Tesco s hands. When I questioned this she told me not to shout which I was most certainly not doing!! she said she couldn t speak to me if I raised my voice which if the conversation was recorded I think you will find I was not doing and yes I probably sounded angry as I am and upset for my granddaughter and with Tesco for making no effort to help!! She also said that the adult with my granddaughter should of check first before entering but obviously she assumed it was local!! So my question is why have a promotion in Cornwall why not check first and make it acceptable to all making sure there is an cinema taking part in the region!!what would happen if they are unable to take up the prise is there an alternative or will it just go to someone else which will upset her even more??",

When querying with the manager we were told you compare the whole basket shop....even your own Tesco label products. How is this a BRAND match and how can you compare products that are not available in other supermarkets I.e. your own products. If this is the case you are falsely advertising your Brand Match Guarantee scheme  which states no less than twice on the bottom of your receipts  your BRANDED basket was \u00a3x cheaper  as opposed to your shopping was \u00a3x cheaper. More accurate to call it a PRICE match if it includes ALL products not just branded products but as I ve said how can you match items that are exclusively your own!",

I want to the store on 18/11/16 to see if it had arrived and I hadn\u2019t been sent confirmation but sadly it hadn\u2019t arrived.  The lady I spoke to at the store was very helpful and apologetic that my order wasn\u2019t there.  She took my number said she would look into it and call me back and as promised she called me later that day to say it had been delivered to the wrong store and it had been re-ordered for me and would be re delivered into my local store (Market Harborough).  I got an email to say it would be delivered into store on 22/11/16.  I got text alerts saying it was going to delivered on the 22nd but I didn\u2019t get any confirmation that it had been delivered so I then checked the delivery address only to find yet again it has gone to the wrong store 53 miles away from me!!!!  Come on Tesco is it that difficult to send my order to the correct place  it is one of your own stores after all????? What now another attempted delivery to another incorrect store???  I ordered these for a Christmas gift for my godson who lives in Ireland  a family member was going to take them over for me but as they fly out tomorrow morning I will now have the added expense of posting them or waiting and taking them with me when I go to see him next year. Another fail by Tesco direct (completely separate order) just last week I ordered a printer cartridge to be sent to my local store.  I placed and paid for the order only to have an email 2 hours later saying it\u2019s not in stock so they have cancelled my order and will process a refund which took 3 days why don t they know their stock levels?

Absolute disgrace  enforcing preferential treatment for the wealthy.   Does Tesco have a policy of discriminating against any other demographics (BAME  LBGTQ) or is it just the working class?   I won t be visiting your stores again  it s equally convenient for me to visit co-op and Morrisons as it is your outlets. I ll be encouraging friends and family to do the same.",

  "post_message": "My Dad collapsed in the Gainsborough store  yesterday. The duty manager Christine and many members of the staff were exemplary in their care and consideration of my Mum  sorting out her shopping ensuring she was warm( getting a scarf and gloves for her)attending to my Dad calling for an ambulance. Hannah took charge of Mums phone and contacted me and put out a tannoy message for Mick  my husband  who by coincidence was shopping there. My Dad has been admitted to hospital   he had a cardiac arrest and after he was settled in   we went back to Tescos to pick up Dads car. Karen was the duty Manager and she was lovely   confirming that Chris had dropped off Mums shopping personally at home 10 mins previously. She then handed Mum a beautiful bunch of flowers Sure enough the shopping was waiting with a get well card for Dad  my mums favourite wine and a bunch of roses. Mum and me cannot thank everyone enough for the way they dealt with the emergency.",

  "post_message": "Dear Tesco I have returned from Chard Tesco following an unsuccessful quest for haricot beans. My Son requires these for his cookery lesson tomorrow and I have had the usual 12 hours notice for ingredients  although he received the list last week - evidently I thrive on a challenge. I could find butter beans  kidney beans  runner beans  broad beans  a rather dated Christmas dvd of Mr Bean (remember when he got the turkey stuck on his head? Oh how we laughed!!) but alas  no haricot beans. I have therefore resorted to buying baked beans and washing off the tomato sauce (by the way  a 420g tin of baked beans only contains 205g of actual beans...he needed 200g - lucky for him  I wouldn t have gone back for more) and I have told him to add them at the end rather than cook for 20 minutes and end up with something resembling houmous. I know he may never win Masterchef - especially with a Mother who has packed dried mixed herbs (with  bay  added to the ingredients list in pen) instead of buying the required fresh thyme  parsley  garlic etc  but I will be expecting a formal apology from Tesco if he loses marks over the haricot beans. Now  you will have to forgive me but I have a dvd to watch...gotta love Rowan Atkinson!!",

I was disgusted by her lack of customer service she gave me & didn t even look at my receipt so i happily rang head office and they told me to bring it back in store as i should of had my money in the first place !i was happy with the other lady who served me as she herself questioned why a member of staff didn t cash it in the first place & with it having the tesco information on the receipt should of been cashed in still regardless of what day it was printed! Was not happy with the service and the woman who refused me needs to learn on her customer skills because i don t think she knew what she was doing anyways!",

  "post_message": "Initial complaint on the 27th October still had no contact back regarding this from the  relevant  person. Your company practices a zero customer service level. I am guessing like most people I spend on average \u00a3400 a month within your stores and petrol stations  meaning \u00a34800 annually and nearly a quarter of million in a lifetime  obviously you could not give a toss about my custom so I am now forced to shop with Sainsburys instead.   I have had 3 fob off emails 2nd  9th and 18th from Amanda Clark.   This my initial complaint and responses.   Order ref:19218800  Yesterday evening our delivery arrived at our door with 12 free range eggs on top of the crates  as per your standard practice  except every single egg was smashed with all of their contents covering the rest of our order. This in turn went all over our carpet and was spread through the hallway and kitchen. We had to wash everything before drying it and then putting them away  plus scrubbing our carpet and mopping the kitchen. The driver was apologetic  however this is not the first issue we have had with the online service  although it is the first time I have decided to voice this to yourselves. We have always shopped with you guys either in store or online as I am sure you can see from my clubcard  but the so called convenience of online is not what I experienced last night after getting home from work. I encourage you to smash 12 eggs and see just how much mess this creates  plus the inconvenience of then not having 12 eggs that you ordered.  I made a complaint last week reference this order. I was called by your HQ on 27th at 10:06am and they were very understanding of my issue and said that a member of staff would call me shortly from the Aylesford depot with a resolution. Someone then called me from a mobile number 07718 534425 at 10:23am I had to explain my issue all over again to him  he then said that he will call me back in the next few minutes once he had spoken to his manager. That phone call never came  so I called back at 16:53 and spoke to a woman who was very rude abrupt and unhelpful. I asked her if someone could call me back first thing in the morning  something that again never happened. I rang the main customer service number on the 28th at 15:52 and was told there is nothing that could be done until the depot call me. We are now Monday and I have heard nothing. It is obvious to me that my custom means nothing to Tesco so I will not be shopping with your brand anymore.",

I was told by a man that I was texted at 9am saying that delivery was 45mins late. I kindly told the man that I hadn t got this text hence my call.  So I waited  and waited and waited. nOTHING! I call again at 13:52 and spoke to a very helpful man called Tom. He politely apologised for the unconvinced and said he ll look into this  he even offered to call me back. I replied with  no thank you I ll hold .. Tom put me on hold  so he could look at notes and contact driver. After some time Tom came back and said that he can t reach the driver. Drivers log states he was back in store at 12:08 as round done. Well obviously it wasn t as I haven t received my food shop. He said he will contact the branch and was I ok to still hold. Well of course i was. Tom came back and said that the store (Erith) had told him  that the driver was out of he s hours. So has returned to store with my shopping as well as another customers. This was extremely frustrating as firstly I was told after first call that it was running 45 mins behind then To be told that driver was out of there hours. Well how can they be if they already know it s running 45 mins late  then surely they already know if the driver is going too be at end of he s shift!!!!! Yet I m still waiting and no contact has been made to apologise or let me know. Tom said that the store (Erith) has said that both deliveries will be out for this afternoon drop of 14:00-18:00. This is a joke and an insult  I booked a time slot  in fact an hour time slot. The most frustrating part is that I have now had to spend this time chasing delivery and typing this post. I was due to go to hospital at 2pm as my mum has had a stroke and these are the visiting times. Now I m late seeing her and having to cut the time short to rearrange childcare. No consideration given by the store what so ever. This is not the first time either!! Extremely disappointed in the customer service given by the Erith branch. If it wasn t for Tom  I would still be in the dark as to where my delivery is. I ve now had to get my neighbour to sit at mine to wait for delivery. One very disappointed customer!!!  Whilst I have been typing I have received a good will gesture voucher for \u00a310. His doesn t help with the lack of customer service shown and the fact I m still having to add more stress to my plate to sort out my shopping being delivered.",

I am writing in regards to a particuarly nasty and upsetting incident this lunch time.  Just been to the Tesco Express in broadmead and slipped over on a broken white wine bottle (so am here in my office with a painful knee and stinking of booze).  The staff inside the staff were not helpful or sympathetic in any way.  The way you can rectify this would be by doing 2 things: 1)  Train your staff in how to deal with spillages.  When something is spilled  get a member of staff to stand by the spill and direct people round it whilst another goes to get a wet floor sign.  This is very basic (was when I worked in a supermarket) but wasn t done.  Customers were (hurriedly) walking though the liquid and glass with no warning.   2)  Train your staff on customer service.  When staff see someone is hurt they should show empathy.  They should ask whether the customer is OK  and possibly help them to their feet.  They shouldn t just say  they re cleaning there... .  I was obviously embarrassed after crashing to the floor  in pain  worried about possible glass in my knees or clothing and got no support from the staff.  The cleaner who was in the area (I assume dealing with another spill/another part of the spill) didn t even make eye contact.",

On top of that I have asked to speak to a manager 3 times and been refused. Your customer service sucks and i now refuse to purchase my food shopping or order from your tescos direct.",

  "post_message": "I had a thoroughly unpleasant shopping experience today in your Tesco Extra store in Hastings. Maybe not your fault directly  but your crappy customers! Turned up with my nearly 3 year old and 3 month old  only shopping here as I could park underground. Drive to the parent and baby spits and could I get one? No. drove round twice. Finally  saw one man sat in his car  door open. Clearly no intention of leaving. Drove along a bit and a woman was sat in her car  lights on. Sat indicating behind her until another driver came behind me and felt unable to see I was waiting for a spot and therefore drive around me. So I gave up. And parked over two spots to enable me to get my doors open fully so as to access the car seats safely. By the time I had the kids put the car - along with my changing bag and bag of bags - I started walking to where the baby trollies are and the second parking spot hogger leaves - with no baby or small person in her car!! Oh yes  she had a car seat  but it was very much empty!! So this selfish cow knows what it s like to take small children shopping  yet still feels so entitled that she takes a spot when alone!! (If you are reading this love  I hope you struggle getting parked somewhere suitable the next time that car seat is occupied!!)   So as I say  this is obviously not your fault but maybe you could have a few more baby spots?? Maybe some that could be parent and child OR disabled to go alongside those you already have?? Or maybe you could find people abusing these spots?? I bet a month of someone s wages would be recouped in a week from people parking there with no kids or with teenagers sat in the car! Or those really annoying ones where one parent stays in the car with the kids and the other goes in - why do they need the spot??  I m thoroughly wound up now today and blame Tesco s entirely!!",

After trying numerous times over the weekend to order toys on the 3 for 2 offer without success  from Tesco direct  I was advised by the online team to try in store. Unfortunately the items I wanted were not available in store. Though not actually on the customer service desk Karen was present when I queried about any other options to order. This lady was obviously very busy with other things yet took about 40 minutes helping me with the online computer in store. The problem was one of the items was coming from a third party and therefore not applicable to the deal  although was showing as 3 for 2 on the site. Unfortunately the in store computer crashed when we finally got the the payment screen with one alternate product. I did return home and place my order saving a huge amount of money which I would have missed out on without Karen s informative help.",

  "post_message": "If this is true I will be changing my provider!!!  A Tesco store in Edinburgh has been accused of discriminating against state school children by making them queue outside while private school pupils are allowed to come and go as they please.  It has been claimed that students from Boroughmuir high school  near the city centre  were made to stand behind a barrier by Tesco staff and only allowed to enter their local store in small groups. But students at the nearby George Watson\u2019s college were not stopped at all.  The issue was raised by a parent of one child at the state school  who said it was a \u201cform of discrimination\u201d. Neil Pollock  a professor of innovation and social informatics at Edinburgh university  said: \u201cEverybody should queue or nobody should queue.\u201d  Advertisement  He told the Guardian: \u201cMy son is at Boroughmuir. He has to stand in the queue each day. He\u2019s not one to complain but it was getting him down - so we decided to do something. He and his friends are frustrated because they have to wait outside whilst others go ahead of them. Tesco also \u2018police\u2019 the door in that they have a person there making sure they queue.\u201d  Pollock said the pupils were \u201cpretty angry\u201d about the situation  saying his son and his friends were \u201creally pleased that some one is finally taking it up for them. They don\u2019t want to get into trouble  or to present their school in a bad light but they just think it is unfair.\u201d  He said his son  who he asked not to be named  once tried to walk in behind a group of students from George Watson\u2019s college. \u201cThe staff member sent him \u2013 but not the Watson\u2019s boys \u2013 out off the shop.\u201d  Pollock posted his complaint on Twitter last week and a Tesco representative responded with a series of tweets  telling him: \u201cI\u2019ve called the store and spoke to the duty manager  John... He said the private school normally have a lesser amount of children which is quicker and easier for the store.\u201d  After Pollock indicated he was not happy with that explanation  a Tesco representative tweeted: \u201cI agree we cannot have different rules.\u201d",

Often its used by people with no children in their cars; people with car seats and no children; people with \u201cchildren\u201d well over 21; people using it as disabled parking.  The last time I came  I had to park at the row nearest the motorway as there were no parent and child spaces and upon going round store \u2013 very few actual children with their parents.   There is limited Parent and Child parking as it is and plenty of disabled and generic parking. Its my understanding the parent and child area should be for those with children under 12 years of age \u2013 and not just utilized by those selfish  lazy people taking away parking with extra room for those who need it.",

  "post_message": "Appalling customer service and complaint handling via Tesco direct customer services tonight! False advertising from one of the  best  retailers in the country! Looking online and found 3 items all listed in their 3 for 2 offer. Thought brilliant just what I was looking for. Quite a few items in 3 for 2 listed as out of stock. But these 3 were in stock. Added to basket but charged full price! Contact them  to get some useless customer service advisor telling me that it was no longer in stock. Then told me that offer doesn t apply to that item. I then direct him to the offer on the website and he states it s because tesco aren t supplying the item directly and sourcing it from a 3rd party! I then advise legally this is false advertising and he states it is not. I then request to speak to his manager (Billy) who states one minute they don t have a complaint process  then they do once I advise him that all my calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes. He thanks me for my  feedback ! I then explain it is not feedback and it s a formal complaint  that I expect a resolution within 8 weeks to which he replies that they will not come back to me with a resolution! Trading standards will find your false advertising interesting and the fact you have no complaint procedure that your manager couldn t talk me through.....I requested a phone call back from someone more senior to which he said wasn t going to happen  after several occasions of telling him I expect a call back am told someone will call me within 5 days......",

  "post_message": "I visited your Tesco Direct website earlier today to purchase some Sylvanian Families toys for my daughter.  I went on  all Sylvanian Families  then sorted by special offers.  After adding to basket 3 of these items (using the button on the screen below) I proceeded to the checkout to see that the saving had not been applied.  Confused  I emptied the basket and tried again producing the same outcome.  So far not a good consumer experience!  I then contacted your Contact Centre in Bury  expecting the call agent to maybe give me a code to input and trigger the discount or even take payment over the phone.  Instead he informed me that the offer wasn t available for products that were provided by a third party seller  but only those provided by Tesco.  When I questioned this  I was rudely informed  it s clearly stated on the website!   Actually when a customer follows the same path to purchase that I tried  it wasn t stated AT ALL  on any of the pages I navigated.  I asked if the offer would be honoured to be told not as  it is clearly stated  (still inaccurate).  Still not a good experience....  I asked to speak to a manager to be rudely told  there isn t one available and even if there was they would only tell you the same thing that I have.   After refusing to take no for an answer I finally spoke to a manager.  After eventually listening  he followed the path to purchase that I did and accepted that there had been no terms and conditions about the promotion on any of the pages that I had landed on. He also agreed that he could see why I felt it to be misleading but then insisted on telling me that I  should have clicked on the item and I would have seen that it didn t have 3 for 2 on that page .  Seems strange  misleading even that there (as pictured) is clearly a 3 for 2 image next to the items and I have no need to  click on the item  as under each is an add to basket button.  Experience is getting even worse...  After discussing with this manager the trades description act and the definition of changing consumer behaviour by misleading them  he finally told me there was nothing he could do as it wasn t an item being provided by Tesco.    After several more  misleading comments (seems Tesco are good at misleading) about how there were no further escalation points or more senior staff members I could speak to  and after refusing to give me the name of the Head of the Contact Centre  eventually he told me an Operations Manager (also unnamed) would phone me within 5 days!!!  Customer Service of the year award might not happen this time guys!  So  here is where we are.... 32 of the 53 Sylvanian Families items that are displayed on the picture with  3 for 2  next to it  are not actually available on the described 3 for 2 offer at all as you have no direct stock and are completing customer orders using a third party supplier.  Brilliant!  And I am supposed to wait 5 days for your unnamed Operations Manager at Bury to get in touch?  Not likely.  So please consider this as a request for intervention.  All I ask is that you honour the offer you clearly have visible on the website which is unbelievably misleading.  My next correspondence will be directly to your CEO whilst copying in trading standards.  I look forward to your response.",

Loving the Xmas decs  btw.  As a reward for getting round your store without stocking up on Krispy Kremes or spending wayyyyyy too long in the clothes aisles I decided to get myself my usual refreshing treat. Your finest freshly squeezed lemonade. I know  not exactly rock and roll  but I like it! Or  at least  I did. I know that change can be a good thing  but the old saying goes  if it ain t broke  don t fix it  and it s especially true in this case.   This lovely refreshing treat of mine used to taste as if you d been hit in the face with a bag of lemons thrown out of a lemon yellow beetle on international lemon day (Tuesday August 29th 2017  btw). Now  it tastes like water that knew a lemon once. Or rather  it was a friend of a friend of a lemon  but that totally counts  right? And don t even get me started on the distinct lack of sweetness in this once wonderfully sweet and sour drink!   Wrong  Tesco  it doesn t count. Not even slightly. Please bring back my lemony treat! The  lemonade  in this bottle is a sad imposter for the lemonade I once loved!",

  "post_message": "I ve really enjoyed my experience trying to deal with tesco direct to return a faulty mattress  it has taken me over a month so far  after being told I need to contact silent night and silent night telling me I need to call tesco directly it s been a bit of a fiasco. In a phone call today from Andrew one of your  customer care representatives  when I asked if anyone knew what they were doing because there s so much back and forth and even now I m being told contradicting information from an email he sent me this morning to what I was told in the phone call this afternoon... Andrew response to me was  well it s actually caused us quite a lot of problems trying to sort this out on your behalf  I had tried to contact the manufacturer directly as I specified many times and they told me they had to deal with tesco directly  even sent Andrew the emails to show him this. As a customer care representative is it not your duty to help and sort out problems - not moan to the customer that it s been an issue. I m fully aware it s been an issue I ve been trying to sort this out for a month!!!! He also doesn t seem to be very happy at sorting this out for me cus he added in the phone call  well we ve done our job by offering a replacement mattress ... As if that just sorts out the whole problem... CONGRATS  perhaps you d like to deliver it to me and then I will say you ve done your job properly...... I ve asked several times how I can make a complaint and not happy with the way Andrew has spoken with me today  he even sighed on the phone when I asked him a question.... I think he might be a bit fed up....I presume all your calls are recorded. I think this whole situation has been an absolute joke and I still haven t had it sorted..... In our phone call today Andrew said they attempted to deliver the mattress last week (to an old work address) but no one was in (someone is there from 7-7) and it has been  left with a neighbour and they don t know who... And no information was left at the address it should of been delivered to about where it is.... Now instead of sending out another mattress for me which I feel would be the correct thing to do in this situation and stop messing me around ...... I have to wait for him to contact the couriers  see where they ve left it  wait for them to collect it from this address and try and get them to deliver it to my home address...... Not really sure why I have to be involved in all of that",

It gave me the option to choose a day to deliver  and no option to pick it up from the store. I chose today and got an email to say they would be delivered today  CUSHTY! 11 oclock this morning  the soundbar arrived! YAY! I checked the tracking on the TV to see.. READY TO DISPATCH. Ok  I thought  lets wait  (I took the day of work for this). I chose to have it delivered today as tomorrow I have to drive 300 miles to my grandfathers funeral and then 300 miles back so won t be home  work on wednesday and the sky engineer coming out on thursday. 5pm rolls around  no sign of a tv  tracking still says READY TO DISPATCH!!! So I call the phone number on the website and was told someone will find out whats going on and call me back  no call back after an hour so I call you again....told someone will ring me back in 15 minutes  half an hour later I get the call to be told that the courier has made a mistake and only received my tv today so it is no where near to being dispatched  I would have to wait until thursday at the latest!!! Another day off work!!! I don t think so!   I did ask about a refund  5 days until the money goes back on my card  still not solving the problem of me having a tv by thursday when the sky engineer comes round. Absolutely shocking customer service! I even asked if we could have a credit put on the account so we can go to our local store to collect another one  but no  apparently this can t be done. I was given two different reasons for the mistake  1) the tv only arrived in the warehouse today so there was no chance it would be delivered today anyway (No call to let me know so i could go to work) and 2) it couldn t get here because of the weather!!! My soundbar made it ok so that doesn t wash im afraid! Finally  after talking to many staff members including a manager  I have been assured that I will get a call tomorrow (tuesday) to see if someone can give me a time slot for the delivery on wednesday instead so I don t have to take the whole day off. Lets see if this happens ",

Whilst waiting for my medication(which I d paid for) a woman handed her prescription to the pharmacy assistant. The conversation went like this: Assistant: Do you pay for your prescriptions? Woman: No I don t. A: Could you tick the box pls? W: (ticks a box) A: Do you have your card? W: No   I dont have it with me. A: Ok! Your prescription will be ready soon...  At which point  the customer toddles off to do her shopping with the notion of returning to collect her meds.  I said to the assistant   i could have told you that same excuse and could have got my prescription for free couldnt i?   The assistant ignored my comment and skulked off round the back!!

So why is it on your site advertised as part of 3 for 2 offer?? Not happy with this false advertising.  Will now have to send all back and shop elsewhere :(",

  "post_message": "Below is a desperate plea I posted on a Facebook site used by many people in ILKLEY. (Ask ILKLEY) I have received many useful comments and advice and one such comment suggested I post on Tesco s official site. I really hope this helps as I am desperate to sleep for longer than 40 minutes at a time before the dreaded high pitched buzzing invades my head!!!  This is a plea to all households and businesses situated around the Tesco store on Springs Lane.  For years a high pitched buzzing sound has been emitting from its roof top (?cooling system) and causing an extreme nuisance to nearby properties to the point that it s not possible to have any windows open during the night. This issue has been raised with Tesco on numerous occasions but with no satisfaction despite their understanding of the situation. Since last Thursday this has been particularly bad and very intrusive especially throughout the night and this his has got to stop! Would everyone who is affected by this please go into the store and resister your concern with the manager or write a post on here and I will ensure it s passed on.  Many thanks.",

  "post_message": "Dear Tesco  I am writing on behalf of my elderly parents   who have had \u00a3104 worth of online Tesco vouchers stolen by fraudsters. They only just discovered this  and when contacting Tesco were told that a person had phoned up in August  impersonating them  and had been authorised to use the vouches. It has not been explained to them how the fraudster managed to either bypass or complete the security checks I assume were in place. They are therefore understandably extremely concerned that this could easily happen again. Most importantly  the have been told that the vouches will only be returned to them in February. I m afraid that this is completely unacceptable. My father is in his late 70s  and they were saving these vouchers to use at Christmas. These vouchers were stolen through no fault of their own  and I feel it is wrong that their Christmas should suffer because of it. My parents are loyal Tesco customers  and I feel they deserve to be treated better than this. I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible and let me know how we can get this process expedited. Thank you  Emma Butterworth",

I called to ask what happened and was told one of the items was not provided by Tesco....so why is it still advertising on website surely this is a breach of advertising rules. I was offered a refund but would take 3-5 working days to get MY money back for an error on Tescos part. You take MY money in minutes yet expect me to wait days for a refund. The items I bought are likely to sell out and I wanted them for my son for Christmas  I now can t purchase them again at another retailer until I receive MY money back. I requested to speak to a supervisor because I do not think this is fair practice  I was told they will call and they have not as yet. I won t be compensated for my time or money that is not in my bank and my son may not get what he wants for Christmas. I couldn t speak to a supervisor and when I said I m not happy about that the call was terminated. I have emailed customer services but I also want to let your customers know that the 3for2 offer is not as good as it appears  check u haven t been charged for your 3rd item!",

Bought first one and experienced the issue with the memory card corrupting the screen on boot up  bought a new (expensive sandisk) memory card  and the problem remained. Went to the garage in Carluke and got a really unhelpful assistant to eventually (after an argument) to swap it out. Got home  camera worked ok with the memory card. Daughter used it on a school trip -- went to look at the pictures  and the camera had wiped them. Paid for an app to recover the pictures from the card (which it did)  only to find the picture quality is absolute rubbish. there is no way this camera is the 720 advertised  needless to say  it will be going back to tesco tomorrow. Best advice -- dont touch this camera with a barge pole. 30 odd quid then a memory card on top is a rip off for this rubbish. \u00a35 would be more appropriate.",

As I pulled in there was a sign on the pumps to say no diesel - as my car is unleaded I thought I d be ok to use the pump still - there was a cone next to the bottom of the station but as the side had come off I assumed it was to stop people going near it  and as the car in front of me had used the pump I assumed I was ok to carry on  about half way though a man working there came over  looked me me  then to the cone and back to me  I asked if he was ok not understanding his gesture  to which he said I shouldn t be using the pump. I found the way he approached me extremely rude! He could of simply said  I m sorry ma am this pump is out of use  to which I would of gone and paid and left it at that! Instead embarrassing me in this was in front of other customers is just very rude! There was no signs to say the whole of bay 8 was out of use  just a scrappy piece of hand written paper to say no diesel! I visited today between 7:30am and 7:45 am! I hope he didn t ruin anyone else s day by being so rude in front of other customers!",

For example see these two boxes of cereal both purchased on the  3 for \u00a33 cereal deal the large one was purchased a few weeks ago and the small one this week same price charged yet significantly less food for my pound. There is also a similar discrepancy in the box sizes for other cereals the multigrain boulders to coco snaps ratio is pretty amazing as well I will post a photo of that in the comments.

They never called me as I had sufficient funds so must have been a technical fault. I e-mailed your customer care team and never even received an apology or a refund for the 5 months that my delivery saver won t have been used for come the end of it by 07/01/17. I decided I might have better luck in one of your stores so popped into your Hodge Hill branch yesterday about 15.30. I made the mistake of using your temperamental self service check outs.

In the unlikely event that we charge you more than what is advertised on the shelf edge or on the product  please visit our Customer Service Desk with your receipt for a double the difference refund.  I was in the Craswell Street store in Portsmouth today and had to ask for this as it was not automatically offered; I notice that your information poster regarding customer rights has also shrunk considerably in size and is virtually impossible to read unless you are stood right next to it which smacks to me of trying to hide customer rights! I asked the employee on the CSD why the double difference was not done automatically and her response was  it can be  it depends . On enquiring what it depended on I was told  on how much it is    I find this response unacceptable and appears to indicate that staff are either not fully trained or it is a deliberate policy.

I ve worn glasses for about 6 years now and have been to many different opticians; but not once has anyone explained my astigmatism. Your optician went out of his way to show me and explain to me what it meant and how my prescription had changed. He even showed me easy to understand diagrams. The ladies working in there were also amazing. My pressure test came up high so I had to do it a second time and they managed to chill me out enough that the reading dropped hugely.

We had an emergency to get to the hospital yet she stood there in the middle of the road arranging her trays telling us that she was legally allowed to park there ! I should have taken a picture to put it up on Facebook but forgot to do so. When you train you delivery drivers make sure they have manners and know the rules of blocking traffic.

Your live chat is also down so I can not talk to someone directly. I am unable to phone. I have filled our your contact form but as that might take a few days for a reply I thought I would message on here too. I have received two texts today telling me my order would be an hour late. At least you had the courtesy to text this time  most of the time it is half an hour late with no warning. It seems like since I have had the delivery saver you don t care when my orders get to me as you already have my money. I have complained before and received an apology but no assurances that it wouldn t happen regularly. If you say you will deliver between certain times then the majority of your deliveries should be within that time  something which has not currently been happening. I have used Tesco deliveries for the past 7 years and the only time  up until the past few months that I had a problem with delivery was when the delivery was cancelled due to snow  which is obviously not your fault. I am getting fed up with having to make sure I am available for 2 hours around my 1 hour time slot. I get the deliveries for convenience but having to wait around for an extra hour is not convenient at all. As I stated on the contact form I filled out  I would like this to be looked into.

  "post_message": "Absolutely disgusting service in your restaurant in Wrexham. Went for breakfast this morning along with my 9 year old son. I asked for a small bowl for my sons cereal which I brought along myself as he doesn t eat what you have available. I was told he could not eat his own food  after explaining why he doesn t eat and why I have his own food. I was then handed a bowl and small amount of milk (just enough to make a cup of tea) and was charged \u00a311.45! \u00a311.45 for one breakfast  2 soft drinks and a dash of milk. I was charged \u00a31.50 for a dash of milk  I don t normally complain about having to pay for milk as I understand restaurants have a policy on bring in your own food but I was charged \u00a31.50 for a  glass (of) milk  yet only got a little. If I had a 8 month old baby with me and had brought a jar of food I would not have been told he/she could not eat it  so why say no to an older child after I ve explained? My son was very upset and kept asking why he was  not allowed to eat his own food yet all the other boys and girls were allowed to eat because they were alright with the food here .",

  "post_message": "Tesco can you help my upset daughter Esme? She was bought paw patrol mashems from your store on the Isle of Wight by her grandparents. This made her very happy  she was even more happy when one of these was Sky! My super pleased daughter played with these for less than 24 hours before Sky  upon being lovingly hugged  gently   burst in my daughters face. As you can imagine my happy daughter them become a grumpy devastated monster (I much prefer a happy daughter) normally this could be solved with cake  chocolate  another toy or a trip to the cinema. But my daughter is currently being assessed for ASD  she is also highly anxious and she is struggling to get over the fact that Sky  her beloved new pet  burst in her face  covering her eyes  mouth and fluffy jumper with liquid. (I certainly hope the liquid is just water) she is now terrified of touching the other mashems in case they do the same to her. So Tesco  to save me having to make a trip all the way back to your store just to exchange a mashem  (my other daughter has bronchitis so would rather not make her leave the house) which she is now scared of and would be even more upset if she didn t get sky  can you help to make my daughter happy again. Please see attached evidence of unhappy daughter  I am happy to send a picture of a receipt and the mashems. Signed one not happy mother.",

I offered but they wouldn t let me  instead they was more concerned cleaning my shoes and my daughter up!

Was waiting for my shopping tonight  due to be delivered between 9-10pm  10:30 still nothing  after half an hour on hold I finally get through to the helpline who tell me the driver didn t have time to deliver my order. I had no contact from the store to inform me of this and they also cannot deliver my order until the following evening  24 hours later than I had booked! There is no priority to send out late orders straight away the next day- which is surely common sense and courteous.  I can forgive this happening once but only two months ago an almost identical situation happened with my order- should you be taking these orders if you clearly cannot commit to getting them to customers during the allocated and paid for time slot?

  "post_message": "Tesco Ammanford have for some stupid reason massively cut the number of their own brand fizzy drinks overnight. Masses of space still allotted to the premium brands though!! And they ve put all their own brand drinks on the top shelf which means short arses like me can t reach the blinking things when stocks are running low and I have to ask someone taller to help me which is mortifying!  They appear to no longer be stocking the 2 litre bottles of own brand cola xero or cherry cola xero at all. Couldn t find anyone in store today to ask if this was really the case  the guy restocking the wine an aisle over told me it wasn t his department and he had no idea what was going on. My teenagers don t get many fizzy drinks  but they got a bottle of each on shopping day to last them the week and in the 2 for 90p deal it didn t break the bank. However 2 for \u00a32 for 1.75l bottles of the premium brand  Coke  means their cola treat is now off the shopping list. Have substituted the cola for orange xero and lemon and lime xero this week  but they re not happy kids.",

After still not receiving an email  I decided it was not a  could take 48hrs  type of email and called back today.

No  outstanding charges  had been previously mentioned to me.

  "post_message": "Hi Tesco. Let me tell you a story about one of your customers (soon to be ex customer along with my husband and daughter).  I started a new job u see  so I thought  I am going to treat myself to a new phone. So I paid off my contract handset  and bought myself a nice shiny new Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. In beautiful Rose gold. I was so chuffed! Well  after shelling out over \u00a3700 on my handset and paying off my old handset  i was pretty chuffed with myself. Well imagine my disappointment when just 3 weeks (nearly 4) later I decide to get insurance on my phone  to be told by tesco I can t buy said policy. I asked for a copy of my receipt as mine had got damaged slightly in the rain  to be told flatly  no  incase I am  trying to fiddle tesco . Well I can assure you that I am not trying to fiddle you  just trying to protect my phone. To add insult to injury  the case that I Bought from your store also broke my phone slipped out of it and guess what?.........I have a smashed screen that I am not insured for! Who would have thought? Well I have decided that I have thrown enough money at tesco now  and I will take my custom elsewhere. I am disgusted. You sell shoddy goods and your staff are  simply put  Rude.  Oh and that job I got.......Yeah  I work for O2. The company that provides YOUR net work services. Hmm.........think I ll be letting people know what poor service is being associated with their name.  I hope to hear from you soon before I seek further advice.",

  "post_message": "I think it is easy for customers to complain about dissatisfaction (and I have  myself  done this). It is less common to note the good service of particular staff members. I feel it is time to do this. I live very near to the small Tesco on Myrtle Parade in Liverpool  (near the university).   I have to say i don t like the shop because my ethical stance is very strongly against self service tills. Most people in Liverpool will know what machine one is describing if the term  job killer  is used. I often find the shop over crowded and don t like having to wait in a queue for a long time because of understaffing if the option is to use one of those things. I could complain about problems or sometimes other members of staff there and regularly walk past the shop several blocks to use the Co-Op.   Having said that you have at least one excellent staff member and I think it is worth Tesco noting this. I read her name badge and she is called Alison. She has consistently been welcoming  good-humoured and friendly. She is efficient and serves quickly and tonight while serving I noticed her genuinely listening to the customer in front of me. (I don t now her in case you think I am one of her friends but) I just think good staff should be commended or even promoted if possible. I thnk I as a customer would be more likely to regularly use the shop with more influence from staff like her.  I just thought it was important to give some positive feedback  and as a company you need more staff like her.",

It s my daughter s 18th birthday on Tuesday so I ordered the Rainbow celebration cake as it s for her party and it says that it serves 16.  I d just like to ask if this is meant to be 16 adult humans or a family of 16 Borrowers !! It is the smallest thing I have ever seen and you have the audacity to charge \u00a310 for it  there is no way you should be selling that cake for 16 people at that price. I am so disappointed. How can you justify that !!",

I received my Tesco delivery last night when unpacking my shopping well i mean before carrying it up the stairs as I live in an upstairs flat I noticed that a bottle of bleach had been leaking and was all over my hands work pants and my carpet runner at the bottom of my stairs. Meanwhile my 3 year son was helping me with the shopping as he does every week which the tesco delivery man witnessed . I called straight away to explain the situation. The bleach had been placed upside down in a bag than did not have handles and hadn t been tied at the top. I was refunded some of my chilled items where thr spilage had went into and sent an a voucher for \u00a35 for the inconvenience.\u00a35 I think that s an absolute insult I ve had to go out today and replace the goods. Whole idea of doing online shopping is that s it s more convenient to me . I was advised a manager would call me back today as the guy I spoke with last night couldn t get through to the team needed but was promised a call today. So 6pm this evening still no call so I have telephoned myself to me told my details hadnt been passed on and all the managers  and all the managers had finished at 4pm.

On short  they just go that extra mile.  Christmas is coming and our Tesco is looking bland! In a world of crazy shoppers who sometimes feel they don t have time for smiles or thank you s  your staff still manage to stay positive and happy.  Tesco  id love it if you could do something nice for them.

  "post_message": "Very disappointed!  After shopping in Chester I went to a small Tesco and bought a meal deal to eat when I got home. When I arrived home in northwich I took one bite of my sandwich to find it tasted disgusting and after looking at the packet was 2 days out of date. I took the sandwich into the northwich Tesco down the road and spoke to a lady on customer services. The lady was in a Nike jumper obviously none uniform  who make no eye contact  was just staring at the sandwich to tell me that as it was there stock (Chester store) there wasn t a lot she could do. I told her this could have made me ill. I also had bought my weekly shop on Tuesday from the northwich store and the pictures show my banana and my orange the day after. She asked what I wanted to do  I replied that obviously I hadn t eaten lunch and would like a sandwich. I went and chose another sandwich from the shelf. When I returned I over heard the same lady talking to a gent buying a lottery ticket saying that  they didn t know what was wrong with people at the moment ... I was handed a refund to which I was then told  oh you can just have the sandwich  thanks love  and that was that... I don t feel like there was any real apology in the matter what so ever considering this could have made me sick. I may reconsider where I do my weekly shop from now on.",

Complete waste of petrol and complete waste of my day off on the phone sorting it out. Nothing offered for my inconvenience or your mishap.

You know how you re now applying a \u00a370 parking charge to anyone who uses a disabled bay without entitlement  or a parent & child space without having a child with them?  Well here s an idea. Those hatched areas at the end of the parking rows - the ones that are kept clear so as to ensure that cars can see if it s safe to pull out? Why don t you apply the \u00a370 parking charge to muppets who park on those who seem to think they have a divine entitlement to park closer to the store than anyone else? You know - the ONLY parking transgression that actually causes real danger to everyone else by stopping them seeing oncoming traffic when they pull out of the parking aisle.  Now there s an idea.

Called on the 8th of October to book my wife s phone for repairs and after i explained what happened they said I will receive a jiffy bag between 3_ day. Waited and the jiffy bag didn t arrived. Called again after 7 days and same story  wait 3_5 days and so on until last week when they told me that it was delivered  to the wrong address. My question is how can u send the jiffy bag to the wrong address and send the bills to the good one? And by the way  we waited from last week and didn t received the jiffy bag. My wife had to make another contract with another provider so she can have a phone so we can communicate between us and with our family. Do you think that is fare to pay the bills every single month  to respect the contract and from your part to take us like some fools? Shame on you Tesco for treating your clients like this",

Who now will not eat the apple as he was made to feel  naughty   I m shocked by the way we were treated  why give out free fruit to children if you then belittle them and their parents  in front of the store:   It s safe to say we won t be taking tesco up on any free fruit while we shop  if we choose to shop there again. I will now explain to my son that he did nothing what so ever wrong.   Thanks tesco Braintree",

  "post_message": "So today I visited your Tesco extra store in Brockworth Gloucester. Can I just say I m absolutely disgusted in respect to how I was treated when I wanted to purchase a coat from you. I had approached your Florence and Fred colleague about a coat which was absolutely filthy from the the floor. (Maybe have a look at your stores cleaning standards to stop issues like this especially being such a  reputable company ) I asked your colleague to check if there was more in stock due to the dirt at the bottom of the coat. She did kindly check for me and offered me 10% off the coat. So I firstly accepted this. When I went to the customer service desk to complete the transaction I was then told that the coat would be none returnable! When my friend questioned why she was ignored by your customer service colleague by the name of  Bev  so then I had to say can you not ignore my friend please  she stated it is what is because we have discounted it. So if anything else had gone wrong with the coat I wouldn t have been able to return it. And all because of how dirty this particular store was?  Bev  wasn t very helpful at all  and I was having my consumer rights penalised due to the state of your stock? How is this acceptable? I was in desperate need of a coat due to circumstances out of my control to then be spoken too and treated like that - again down to the quality of the lack of cleanliness. Absolutely shocking is an understatement. Totally disappointed.",

As tescos has the most stores in my local area I thought they would as there isn t many other places to get bits.  Can tescos explain why they haven t got anything in ad it is for charity?",

I love your coleslaw  I really do but if I have to dry clean one more handbag  or my shoes from  carrier bag seepage  then I will send you the bill. You re making me skint.   Surely it s not that hard to package your products accordingly?   I think the fact you charge \u00a34 for one layer of cheap  Christmas  biscuits and charge an additional \u00a31 for a packet of cigarettes compared to other shops  that you would have enough money to seal other goods that leak.   Just a suggestion.  I don t like wet feet unless I m in the bath.  Thank you   Sophie",

He took my number and said he would call if he found anything. 2 hours later I received a call saying he had found a few things for me and that he would leave them at customer services.  He went out of his way to help me and I was really impressed with the service I received. I would just like to say a massive thank you to Tony and the rest of the staff at Tesco for helping.

Because the normal-price flowers were in water she didn t seem at all concerned. Even when my mum asked if they could be watered the staff member said no.  It only takes a few seconds to put water in those buckets  and if staff are going to dehydrate the flowers like this then I don t see why they bother even reducing the price. They might as well throw them away immediately because no one is going to want to buy dead flowers.  I am disappointed by Tesco s attitude.",

I always hear lovely stories about customers being helped by kind members of staff...which stores do they work I ? I d love to know as chichester tesco definitely didn t achieve that goal today!

  "post_message": "No Toast to Tesco.  On-line purchasing. So convenient. You select the goods on the website. You opt for click and collect. The supplier confirms the transaction. Days later you go to the collection-point but leave empty handed. There is no record of your transaction on your account with the trader. But your credit card bill clearly shows the amount has been credited to the trader. Sounds like a dodgy Ebay \u2013 perhaps from the far East?  Well. Cheshunt is East of Watford but this is not Ebay. It\u2019s Tesco Direct.  My \u00a318 toaster purchase from Tesco Direct was purchased on a Friday  confirmed on line and the money credited to Tesco on my credit card statement. But five days later my entire purchasing record showed only a lawn mower from some four years before. There was no record of the toaster purchase.  Happily a thirty minute telephone call with a courteous and very helpful Ms Tesco straightened it out.  But the moral is: caveat emptor does not only apply to Ebay. Check your purchase confirmation not just on the Tesco website \u2013 but also have you received their email with reference number \u2013 and importantly - is your latest purchase recorded in your Tesco account. Saves the buyer and the lovely Ms Tesco a lot of time",

Anyways I was then told I d been refunded  I d be charged again tomorrow and re delivered....BUT my refund could actually take a week to go back into my account. Well I m a single mum of 3 young children the money I used to pay for my shopping which you took out of my account was the last of my money  so how am I meant to pay for it again tomorrow? I literally have nothing in my kids need to be fed! I was then told the only chance of me getting my shopping without paying for it was a re-drop...which he was 99.9% sure that wouldn t happen (even though I d been offered 3 different delivery times prior) so unless I pay for my shopping again (with no money as I ve used it all on my shopping which I d already paid for) I m not going to get it or my money back for anything up to a week! So firstly can you please explain to me how I m supposed to feed my 3 children for the week? Secondly why wasn t I even informed my shopping delivery wasn t coming? Thirdly why are your staff not taught proper customer service seeing as that s there job?

I decided it was time to buy my children bunk beds  upon finding the perfect ones on your site  I got excited & purchased  along with 2 new sets of butterfly bedding & sheets. Now  this is where things took a turn for the worse.  I m not sure whether it was the fact I ordered bunk beds  for TWO children  with TWO sets of bedding & TWO sheets that gave you the overwhelming urge to charge me TWICE... or just an unfortunate mishap. I m sure you can imagine though  this made me somewhat upset. Upon speaking to customer service  I was informed the duplicate charge would be refunded  albeit in TWO working days... ok  something s cannot be helped...  So  let me tell you about my SECOND misfortune with your service. Upon receiving my order  you can imagine my surprise when one of the bedding sheets wasn t there but instead I had received a Scandinavian mouse toy set. Now  I don t know what bed sheets you ve been sleeping in but I m pretty sure it doesn t look like a mouse.

  "post_message": "Hi   I was in one of your Tesco stores this evening to purchase some bread to make sandwiches for my lunch tomorrow (cheese  ham and mayo)  the store itself was quiet  in fact I didn t see another customer during my entire visit. There were plenty of staff on hand though should I have needed assistance  that was until I went to pay. Five checkouts and not a single one was manned  apart from the cigarette kiosk which was occupied by a  team member  sat down looking like her cat had just died.   Thank God for self checkouts... as a company you d be lost without them. I m so glad you employ someone to stand in front of them shouting at people that the checkouts are all closed and reminding me that I have to scan  bag  pay and wait for my change myself.   Here s a suggestion.  Why don t you just do away with all of the staff and turn Tesco into one enormous vending machine  or  you could just get the customers to order your stock and stack the shelves themselves  that would save you even more money in the long run. You ll be getting Siri to run your Customer Services next.   Meh...",

  "post_message": "Hi there    Having received my shopping this afternoon from my fab delivery driver. I have found upon eating the value nachos that the ingredients have been suddenly changed. This is however normally of no concern  but I have a small amount of foods that i can eat. Literally it is about 10-15 items  most of which I normally buy from the  free from  section.   These were my one snack that I could eat like having a bag of crisps and didn t cost the earth  plus they saved me on numerous occasions from being doubled over in pain. So not only have I lost something that kept me going I am also laying with my head beside a bucket because corn flour has been added to the nachos.   I know it is not your fault that I can t eat anything else  but is there any way I can get the old ones again. Seriously I have been buying almost 7 packs a week for months. Also it would have been great to have had some sort of notice that they have been changed to prevent me spending most of the day unwell.  Many thanks",

These are bought specifically for my 5 year old  only he likes them  so this was very nearly a week out of date dairy product in the tummy on a young child.  I have held off complaining here because we were hoping to receive some customer service from your store but they really don t seem to be taking it very seriously. We were offered a \u00a35 voucher (which would barely cover the cost of coming and replacing the product we now don t have btw) but really money isn t the point  we wanted them to accept that this isn t acceptable and be able to reassure us it wouldn t happen again  not try and fob us off.  We haven t received a great service from Tesco home deliveries in quite a long time and this is just a further loss of confidence in your store and your brand.",

Firstly  your tubs of fresh mash  the clear film is an absolute nightmare to get off once the mash has been cooked.

Also I buy your Tesco Finest wafer thin ham and the packaging says peel and seal and my ham packaging never ever sticks back down so I end up wrapping the pack in foil which defeats the object of peel and seal if it doesn t work!",

  "post_message": "Dear Tesco   I look back on my childhood with fond memories. My twin sister and I were inseparable. We did everything together  wore the same clothes  and even ate the same food. Our favourite meal of the year was our Colin the Caterpillar birthday cake - the greatest cake in the world.  We are now 27. Rather  we turned 27 yesterday. We enjoyed the day  but since I was diagnosed with coeliac disease 6 years ago things just haven t been the same. Despite looking high and low every year we have been unable to find a gluten free Colin.  This year  we called the local Tesco store (Aberdeen Danestone) and  to our delight  were told that a gluten free Colin had found its way to the cake shelf. We rushed to the store  but the staff were unable to locate Colin. The stock control systems said that Colin was in the building  but he was nowhere to be seen. Not to be defeated and in desperation  we checked two more stores. Unfortunately we were left disappointed again.  Our birthday was fun  but we thought it was going to be much  much better with Colin celebrating with us. We will try again next year  but are really beginning to lose hope that our future birthdays will ever be as happy as those already passed.  Yours faithfully   Catriona Denham and Siobhan Coulter",

As days pass  the older folk are getting older  but our younger generation are maturing enough to  what we as a branch like to think  future volunteers to the legion   Allowing us to collect in your store for long days and a touching week is hugely appreciated  I know most stores up and down the country have had  Poppy Stalls  set up but this year in Padiham was unique!  With customers  Staff and the volunteers all contributing to what was described as a  family feel  to this this year s Poppy Appeal!   A massive hand to everyone at the Padiham Store!  Tesco; you ve got yourselves a good bunch there!   #LestWeForget #LiveOn #Tesco",

  "post_message": "I was in your Slough branch about half an hour picking up a few quick items before heading off to Windsor afterwards. To spend less time in store  I thought it would be a good idea to use your self service machines. When I started using it  there was an issue which required a staff member. I was surprised to see there was only one person aiding customers at the machines at what was a pretty busy period of the day. Because they were occupied  I attracted the attention of someone walking past which they acknowledged but did nothing else. The lady in question kept walking and informed the other lady who was assisting that I needed help. I found this to be unhelpful and wasting of time. When I finally assisted  the lady called on another colleague because there was an issue with the coin bins. After waiting for this to be resolved  I was taken to a till to be served a person. What should have taken 15 mins at the most lasted close to half an hour. It meant that i was delayed on what I planed to do afterwards and also meant I was able to get petrol before leaving.",

  "post_message": "Dear Tesco   I d like to to express my appreciation to one of your staff members at Burnley Tesco Extra.   On 27th October my son was born at 32 weeks. I went to the Tesco Extra with a list of essentials I needed for the new arrival and one of your staff  Billie  helped me get everything that I needed and it transpired that she too had had a baby at 32 weeks. I think she could see that I was a bit out of my depth and was more than happy to help.  Anyway  a week later I was down at Tesco again and I saw Billie and she asked me how my son was doing. I told her that everything with him (Sonny) was going brilliantly and he was getting stronger and bigger by the day but I explained that 7 days after the birth of my son my partner had suffered a massive heart attack. We talked for 5 minutes and she said how sorry she was and she wished both my son and partner all the best.   As I was heading out of the door she ran up behind and said she wanted to do something special for my other half and our new son. A few days later I went back in store and she and her staff had put together a big hamper full of baby and Mother related items such as beauty products  cards  baby clothes  candles  and stationary for our other two boys.   I think what Billie did goes above and beyond her call of duty and should be recognised for her generosity. These are the kind of people you need working for you...these are the kind of people the world needs more of. Keep up the amazing work Billie   Many thanks   Kris",

I visited your Stranraer store on Saturday morning for my weekly shop and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement  Unfortunately for me I am on of  those  people that have been diagnosed with celiac disease. Not a fad dieter or anything but fully diagnosed. So when I went to your  free from  frozen section and I am using the term free from very loosely here because in with the so called gluten free section was the quorn meat free and vegetarian foods which are definitely not free from but packed with things like WHEAT so after a good rummage around my grand choice of selection was a margarita pizza  strawberry cones  fish fingers or chicken nuggets. So after picking the pizza I then went to the  free from  section in the Isle for a pack of rolls to go with my bacon.... No rolls 2 types of bread and an absolute ton of cakes and biscuits. Since the store renovation the selection has went down hill. So I abandoned my basket and went to morrisons and spent 90 quid on my weekly shop. Your loss tesco  iwpild suggest sorting your freezer section out before someone buys something that isn t actually free from and ends up ill......and maybe provide more of a selection like I dunno maybe morrisons or asda!",

I honestly can t believe people didn t want the double vouchers. I never found it difficult to understand and i m sure many other people didn t  to  so making it easier doesn t seem a fair reason for stopping them. There must be other family s who relied on the double voucher scheme.  Another reason to shop less with you.",

How exactly is this good customer service? Cookies are Cookies are Cookies.

After around 10 minutes I noticed it on the very top of your shelves. I was unable to reach it. So I asked one of your employees who s response was  I m busy at the moment what isle are you on and I ll send someone over ... I gave her the isle number 23 and waited for someone to appear. A few moment year one of your employees appeared (I think his name was Anthony). I asked him if he could please get me 4 bottles  off the top shelve for me. He started at me for a moment and appeared to be slightly confused until he asked me something which I did not understand  so he asked me again (which bottles would you like as there is more than one flavour) to whomever is reading this may think  how could you not understand that?  Well.. the gentleman I spoke to had a speech impediment and Down s syndrome and struggled to put his words together but not once did he get upset or angry with me asking him to repeats himself.

I have always purchased these in the store as 2 of us are Diabetic and we are ok with this particular Coke. Customer Services said that 1) once the store runs out  that offer is finished. 2) there were 13 boxes in the store. If the offer only started yesterday and there are mountains of Coke/Diet Coke in store but none of this one surely  something is wrong. CS suggested that I go to another store as they still have stock  30 minutes drive away or purchase 12 x 330m @ \u00a33.55.

Luckily enough I m not made like that so instead I removed all 3 from the shelf and set off to find a member of staff  eventually found a cleaner who helpfully went out the back to find someone. He then came out and explained that the seals  always get broken   there s not much they can do about it  he finally agreed to remove the items from sale. but my guess is that they will be back on the shelf today. What security measures do you have  to make sure that these items dont get  tampered ?",

  "post_message": "After reading this article I will say I am a very disappointed customer. I cannot believe a large supermarket chain would exclude baby formula from their reward points and refuse to validate a car park ticket. Honestly there really is enough pressure on Mums to breastfeed from our so called professionals but for it then to be highlighted by a supermarket chain is a step too far! Baby formula is an essential item and should not be put in the same category as smoking. Not every Mum is able to breastfeed and no judgment should be made. Every child is different and a Mother has the right to choose. I am currently on Maternity leave looking after my 4 month old daughter and have brought her formula in your stores. I am disappointed to learn that this item is excluded from your reward system. I understand that Tesco want to be seen  to be supporting breastfeeding  I just feel you are going about it the wrong way.",

  "post_message": "Dear Mr Tesco I would like to take this opportunity to say a big well done on handling the Hatchimal saga with excellence and professionalism.  Sadly I have resulted in sarcastic tack ticks to get my point across  the way that this is being handled is an absolute joke. I fear that you are praying on the vulnerable parents who for whatever reasons do not want to disappoint their children at Christmas just  to get people into your stores  then to be faced with a big fat NO or we haven t had any for weeks  no idea when stock will be coming in when clearly your website which is sending alerts for local stores that you have limited stock. How can this be when you get to said store and they haven t had any for several weeks. Also when you call said store and ask the kind gentleman on the phone who then confirms they have three green draggles and two pink so you race to said store and then to be told the same story  NO STOCK. How can you be advertising online to say limited stock and then to call and be told they have 5 in total in store to then drive to the store and they have none in stock?? I feel like you need to give an explanation  The lady on Customer services said that this had happened on several occasions over the weekend but yet the local web still says as I am writing this that the shop has limited stock. This is why I am convinced that you are using underhand techniques to get people to store so they are disappointed and heartbroken that they will then chose to purchase something else from your store. Bravo Tesco on your marketing and advertising departments you should be very proud. Or is it that you are getting them in stock and staff are beating the public to it and selling them for outrageous amounts on various selling websites? Either way I think I can safely say that TESCO will not be my chosen supermarket anymore having been let down far too many times.  Merry Christmas Tesco",

  "post_message": "So this evening I manage to purchase the no 1 selling xmas toy from Tesco direct and can go to bed smiling knowing that I have now bought the last xmas present.  However  within 10 minutes another email stating that there has been a problem with my order and a full refund will be given but will take 3-5 working days to go back into my bank account!!!! Yet you quite happily took the money straight out of my bank so in other words  if you do get any of these in stock within the next 3 days at least  I will be unable to purchase one as I am still waiting for the refund from you!!! If you don t have the stock don t advertise and certainly don t take money out of people s bank accounts!!! I hope your children get everything that they have asked for this xmas!!!!",

Director 3: An even better idea would be to install them then close the petrol station off so no one can actually use them!  Got to love your idoit company tbh!!!  Here s another great idea!   Director 1: let s hire lots of temporary staff over Xmas to help the stores  customers and staff out with the Xmas rush. Director 2: yeah that s a great idea! Director 3: Yeah that s a fantastic idea But one small change! we will sack a load of our permanent staff to off set this balance!!",

  "post_message": "Thank you to Tesco Carluke for their kind gift of a raffle prize for our fundraiser in aid of our kids  youth football team. Once again Tesco did not disappoint. Over the past 10 years I have been fundraising for different organisations and charities and the one supermarket who has always came through for supporting us is Tesco. This year has been particularly difficult for collecting donations. Having sent out over 30 letters and even some handed over personally by my 7 year old son we have had very little response. One main competitor of yours even refused to accept the letter from my son as they  no longer do that sort of thing . Having to explain to a 7 year old that one of the largest supermarkets couldn t help his little team wasn t an easy task - especially when all through the year and more so at this time their tills are ringing every second  but couldn t spare a small token is pathetic.  Thanks to your community representative not only for the donation but also for the lovely phonecall to offer the prize and letter wishing us luck. It really means a lot to be supported. So thank you  thank you and thanks again to Tesco Carluke for helping the little guys continue to have fun and learn new skills keeping them enthused and out of trouble for years to come!  Every little helps!  With thanks  Amanda.  Proud mum of Callan  Milton Rovers YFC Carluke 2008s. Xx",

I m Having a Christmas meltdown .   Whilst I m sure a lot of people get stressed by Christmas I m sure they aren t having a meltdown as this is an autistic trait  which I might add my son has as he is autistic. Have you experienced a melt down? Or understand what a melt down is? The child or adult with autism gets so overwhelmed with so much information they can t actually process all the noise light  smells etc and hence the meltdown which you can t control or prevent. Then you get stared at my ignorant people who believe your child is a spoilt brat.....when in fact their brain is working double fast and there is too much information to take in in one go.   I don t think you thought this one through very well and I was quite offended by it to be honest. My son and I visit our local Tesco quite often and a lot of the staff know about my son and always make time to chat to him even though he s 4.  I think a lot of autism parents are going to find this offensive as I have.....different wording I think should be used next year!!",

  "post_message": "Earlier this evening I visited your King s Lynn Extra store with my daughter  Aurora. Both of us were in The Monday Mood and inevitably  being 4  Aurora was frankly really doing my head in. I d much rather have gone straight home but being a Single Lady I have cats and they needed some of your finest cat food.  Most of the way round the store Aurora insisted on pushing the trolley and after too many near misses to count I made her sit in it (and yes there was an argument about it). As we reached the self scan checkouts I told her not to mess about pulling the trolley back and forth as the last time she did this she trapped her fingers. I told her this no less than four times. Of course I was ignored and the fingers were trapped.  I had very little sympathy and even less patience at this point but The Lovely Lady (who s name I missed) who works on the self scan checkouts at your store had lots of sympathy and patience. She  pulled out a bag of sweeties from her drawer for Aurora and put a big smile on both our faces and it reminded me to take a deep breath  Monday s don t last forever!  Of course this didn t last long because Aurora then insisted on getting in the car by herself and somehow managed to trap her head in the door so my deep breaths kind of stopped working.  But anyway  I thought it was lovely of your team member to be so kind and caring when I was clearly at my wits end so I thought I d share my story with you and hopefully my appreciation will find it s way back to The Lovely Lady so she can know she put a smile on two weary faces on such a dreary Monday evening. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

  "post_message": "Today me and my partner visited Tesco extra in serpentine green  Peterborough to do a  big  shop as I had a voucher for \u00a37 off \u00a350 and over. I m a part time wheelchair user but when it comes to shopping I have to use my wheelchair due to the pain from various illnesses. We couldn t see any wheelchair trolleys so we asked at customer service just in case they had moved them. We were told they were all broken and we re waiting for new ones  and that was that no offer of assisted shopping  which I know is offered due to working in retail over 12 years ago. I was absolutely fuming because we now could not do the big shop we needed to do or use the voucher because I cannot wheel myself or keep a basket on my lap due to my health.  Surely all the disabled trolleys did not break all at once? So why leave it until they all break to order new ones? And why was no assistance offered? Was it because we are a young couple because I always see plenty of elderly people who are in better health than myself getting the assistance they need  but younger disabled people get ignored and swept to the side with a not my problem attitude?  I barely socialise due to anxiety so shopping is my release and common place I know and we always go at a quiet time due to this but today my anxiety hit me very hard because of the way I was treated as a disabled customer! It takes away your freedom when little things like this happen  if they were all being used then ok but the fact that no one had the common sense to order new ones when they re tatty old ones started breaking one by one I do not know?! Some people will think this is a pathetic small problem but to someone who is disabled it s not small  it means we lose a bit of independence that we try so hard to keep.",

I bet all those penny\u2019s add up to rather a nice sum as most parents will absent mindedly will pick up catalogues and not notice.

My food shopping delivery which was due today  has had to be returned to store  leaving my  my husband  and my children of ages 11  9  3 and 4 months without food  nappies and baby milk.

Order put through online no problems  email confirmation received and clubcard vouchers showing on my clubcard account as spent. No problems right?? WRONG!! According to your customer services  I needed the full amount of \u00a374.09 in my bank account in order for you to take the payment  and as this wasn t the case I couldn t have my delivery. Not once on my order  emails  tesco website... In fact NOWHERE  does it state that the full amount needs to be available funds - if it did  or I actually had the full amount available  I wouldn t have wanted to use my clubcard vouchers now would I?! Because of this I now have no food  no baby milk and no nappies  and I am going to have to drag my 4 children out in the cold and borrow money to do my food shopping until my clubcard vouchers can be reissued and used.

So I ve asked for bags on the basis I can at least recycle them  and I always give my used bags back to the driver. However  today s shop of 128 items was delivered in over 40 plastic bags - that s about 3 items in a bag. Many of them contained only one item. Even the 9-roll toilet roll pack  which barely fits in a bag  was in one. Is it quite necessary to use so many?! There seems little point trying to encourage customers to go bagless if you then use three times as many on those that have them. Or are you trying to make us feel so guilty at the excess that we refuse any more?",

Last week my eldest girl came home with exactly the same issue.  I took them back yesterday and was greeted by the clothing manager.  I explained my disappointment.  She told me they looked far older than 6/8 weeks old and as I hadn t got my receipt I couldn t prove it.  I said my girls were only 8 and 10. I would have expected them to grow out of them before they fell apart.  The manager pointed out that they were not leather and we re very scuffed.  I pointed out that I was not complaining about them being scuffed that they had not my expectations as a Tesco product.

  "post_message": "Banana s. I have 2 a day everyday at work  I bought my usual bunch of 10 from your Tesco Extra near Pendleton Way in Salford. Bought my 1st 5 in today & placed them in their usual happy spot in the corner of my desk. About 2 hours later I realised there were big cobweb type things from my bunch of bananas to my colleagues fan just to my left with little black creepy crawlies everywhere. Thankfully the fan was turned off  it was really gross! I wish I d taken a photo but I was too busy running to get masses of tissue. It resulted in people panicking  itching like crazy for a few hours and a massive crazed nervous clean up. It resulted in lost work time  understandably a bit of embarrassment for myself  we also had clients in. So disappointed  recently whenever I get bananas from the small Tesco on Trafford Road in Salford they seem to be rubbish & not good for much. I am a disappointed banana consumer.",

Not only was it uncomfortable as a customer watching that but as a woman watching another woman s boyfriend speak to her in such an aggressive way in such a public forum. I think some shop floor conduct needs to be addressed with the team members of this store as this is not the first time I have been in there and something of this nature happen (the last time was 4 members of staff standing around talking about how messed up they planned to get that weekend etc.)",

  "post_message": "Dear TESCO For the past few weeks and months I have been genuinely frustrated by my shopping experience in the Guildford store.  Every week you have discontinued a product I buy weekly. Every week I have wasted time  first trying to locate the product  then finding out it has been discontinued.  I have spoken to countless duty managers  all have told me  it s not us  it s head office . Well Head Office  I have now crossed the bridge and yes  I have found that pastures are greener with your competitor.  They cater for families  they cater for people who cook  for people who have regular contact with the continent and love a variety of foods. I do not care about the aisles full of crisps  pot noodles and coke. I wish to choose between Tesco branded and non Tesco branded (funny how this portion gets discontinued!).  A couple of weeks ago I wanted to buy my usual box of 15 free range eggs! Of course discontinued.  How can you discontinue eggs?????   Anyway  highlighted are some of the items you have decided to discontinue  some of them just last week and that was what tipped me over. Those 7 items you use to sell are part of a very small shop for me  this \u00a350 shop was just a tester. I found out my new online set up will work for our family. Not need to waste 1.5 hour weekly trying to locate products you keep on moving around at best or discontinue at worse.  To you  I was worth \u00a3110/week  that is over \u00a35000/year. You have decided I was not worth catering for  you have preferred students to local families (apparently this is your target market in Guildford  so I was told). That was your strategic choice. I think you got it wrong.",

When we had finished our shopping and got into the car I couldn t wait and had to have one  BUT to my dissapointment when I bit into it there no chocolate even thou on the packagaing it was stated  stuffed with chocolate filling  I thought oh well maybe they just missed one so I tried another and again no chocolate. Neither did my sons and when we tested the other 2 they didn t either.   This is a huge dissapointment when your craving them and nothing else with do and have a 3 year wanting a chocolate fix  it wouldn t have been so bad if the actual dognuts were fantastic because they weren t.  Please see attached photos of packaging and receipt In comments.  Waiting to hear a reply from you on how you are going to fix this solution.  A chocolate craving pregnant mummy \ud83d\ude41",

Got up at 7.30 (on a Sunday!) but no one turned up.  I emailed.  Tesco called at around 14.00 to apologise  saying that a delivery van had been at the house  rung the bell but found no one was in. Well  firstly we do not have a door bell  but we do have three dogs (that bark) and last but nit least I was home all day! They said they would reschedule for 17.30 this afternoon.  Of course I was a little annoyed  but accepted the new delivery time as I do need food in the house and didn t fancy driving all the way into town (40min drive each way!). It s now 19.30 and still no delivery  or phone call... \ud83e\udd14",

  "post_message": "Today my sister was shopping in Basildon store number 3060  when she was about to alight the travellator she was suddenly hit in the back by a wheelchair trolley. An old chap had tried to go onto the travellator  but could not hold onto the trolley  which then hurtled down the ramp and struck her in the back. She was badly hurt and shaken  and customer services were quick to attend. However  they called for the first aid manager  who refused to put the incident into the accident book  as he believed Tesco are not at fault. I am shocked by this attitude  as I believe if these trolleys are not suitable to go down the travellator  then surely there should be be some mechanism to prevent it from going onto the ramp? Not all old or disabled people look to read warning signs and I dont think this is good enough an excuse not to enter in the accident book. My sister cares for her disabled husband as well as working full time. She looked pretty poorly this afternoon  but has expressed that she was grateful that this was not a small child at the bottom of the ramp  as the consequences could have been unthinkable. She felt sorry for the elderly gentleman as he also looked very shocked and upset also.",

She wanted to use a prepaid Mastercard she had brought though me (see the picture) she was told she couldn t use it for payment. She went to the customer service desk and they called through to your head office and they said the same. The thing I want to question is the fact that s it s a Mastercard a payment method you accept. On the website of the card issuer it s described as a card that s accepted anywhere you can use a Mastercard. So with this in mind why was my mother made to feel so embarrassed in a busy store but staff who clearly didn t know what payment methods you accept.

  "post_message": "Tesco   Look  I know I ve done the typical  man  thing and left it late in the day to purchase the cauliflower I had previously forgotten. I shot to my local tesco  under the misguided notion that they wouldn t let me down. I sauntered in  headed full of confidence to the veg section  to be greeted by 3 sorry looking cauli s. It was akin to visiting the local dog shelter  i felt like the one I picked was begging me to release him from his misery rotting away in a battered old green crate. So I picked the little fella up  and took him home to fulfill his potential as part of a family roast. Only to arrive home  out of the bright glare of the lights of tesco  to be confronted with what can only be described as a cauliflower no larger than an apple. If I had paid for the weight of it  I d have been better investing my 95p in to some precious metals instead  I d probably have got more for my money.  It was so small  my equally distraught wife asked if there was a minimum weight printed on the packaging  which led me to discover the final cherry on top. The sorry looking little cauliflower was already 2 days past his best before  I m not entirely sure what his best would have been but I m guessing it wouldn t have been too impressive. Anyways  I m off to go and eat a roast  minus the cauliflower cheese I was so looking forward to  I ll leave you with my parting gift  photos of this now infamous little cauliflower  Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns  Liam Jones  PS  I ve named him Colin  I hope you don t mind",

After attempting to contact my local community champion (on numerous occasions!!) asking if it would be possible to promote my community group - Nippers Nutrition - via a poster in store  I ve been left absolutely fuming at the fact that they haven t even had the decency to even acknowledge that I exist  let alone respond to my request.   Although I am aware that Tesco must get inundated with a multitude of promotional requests  I would like to think that you care enough about aiding our childhood obesity crisis to at least acknowledge someone who is trying to aid the weight and well-being of children for free - particularly as you ve recently introduced a free fruit for kids scheme!!   I know that many may see my complaint as minor and/or irrelevant  but as it s an area that I am extremely passionate about and I feel that supermarkets such as Tesco have the ability to aid awareness of (even if it is something as simple as a poster!)  I wanted to highlight my concerns in the hope that you may make something so important a priority for your community champions.",

I was at Tescos Extra Grimsby Victoria Street this morning waiting for the store to open  I was parked in parent and child as I was with my 9 week old daughter and I was fortunate to get a space. I saw two cars- one in the bay next to me (as per photo) who never had a child at all never mind one under 5 and the car parked opposite had a child of about 9/10 years old.  This is a clear abuse of the policy you have in place  it is very very hard to get a parent and child parking space at this store and the other day i had to park at the bottom of the car park lugging my  baby and car seat up to the store in the freezing cold  this is after  having to park next to shrubbery so I could get the car seat out of the car. The car parked next to me stayed  in the bay for over an hour. I informed your customer service and I was told that as Tescos don t own the car par there is nothing they could do.  I am appalled  those parking bays are vital for parents with carseats/ prams and you should be enforcing that customers dont take advantage of this and to say it is not your car park when it is full of your signs is ridiculous.",

I m sure santa \ud83c\udf85 will be relieved at how much easier it will be this year! One of our children struggles and we normally only get asked about 2-3 things  this year we have over 10 things to pick from!  Problem will be is santas sack big enough for them all this year!

We live in North Devon and on bonfire night our four year old daughter Maisie suffered awful burns from a firework that flew across the field horizontally instead of vertically. She is currently being treated by Bristol Children s Hospital and is back in surgery for the third time in a week tomorrow. While we have been in hospital she saw an advert for the much sought after  Hatchimal  and decided that was the only thing she wanted for Christmas. It soon became apparent that it would be easier to find her the unicorn she d asked for last Christmas! I asked on Facebook if anyone had a Hatchimal I could buy and before I knew it Sue and the team at Tesco Extra had scoured stores nationwide  found  and delivered to our door  this very Hatchimal for us to stash away for Maisie for Christmas. A get well gift from them too her \u2764\ufe0f They have made one little girls Christmas  thank-you so much. The Roe family x",

We live less than 100 yards from the store and my ma and da would be in the shop everyday  however they were stopped by security today and informed that my da wasnt allowed in and was barred for 3 months.  Every morning he would take a walk for 5-10 mins  usually to yorkgate and back up  apparently this morning he went into the shop picked up a paper and tried to walk out before being stopped  due to his illness he would a been unaware what he was doing and removed from the store.  When they were stopped and informed of the ban my mum explained his condition to the security guard who got the manager   again they were informed of my das illness and that he would a been unware but the manager didnt care he said that he was barred. This flies in the face of the other staff especially in their post office part who have been brillant with my da  if he gets to the counter and its clear he is on his own they would ring our house and keep him there till we get there.  You would think they would use common sense  but not in this case. Instead they would rather stop and embarrass two pensioners. Customer services are a joke they asked me to speak to the manager and explain the situation despite me telling them the manager was informed but didnt seem to care .

I ducked into the Tesco to escape and the staff let me hide out there for a while  made sure the guy had gone away and gave me a coffee before I left. Not sure if I thanked them properly as all I wanted to do was get away from the situation and get to work but your staff were amazing!",

Mum and I split up to go to separate tills  and one lovely lady called Melissa (part of your team) came to help me. I think it was obvious I was struggling at self check out! Melissa and I got chatting while putting the shopping through and I told her about my disability which also means that I m now unable to eat due to my stomach being paralysed. I didn t think anything of it but then Melissa appeared with these beautiful flowers; and she said  you might not be able to eat but you can enjoy these flowers  I was so shocked and overwhelmed  it didn t hit me till I was in the car and the happy tears started! Its the nicest thing someone I don t know has done for me since becoming disabled  and it really has made my month. So thank you Melissa  you are a true diamond!

My young son was unfortunately sick in store and both ladies were so kind and helpful that they made a very stressed mummy feel at ease and calm.  They arranged to choose some replacement clothing whilst I stripped and cleaned my son up.   They brought water and replaced my trolley and some shopping which he was unfortunately sick over.  They also gave him a lovely gift once we were all cleaned up and ready to leave.  Unfortunately I didn t get their names but on checking the box from the Toy they gave him noticed one of them had written Katie on it.  If you could find out who they were and pass on my heartfelt thanks I would be most grateful.  They were indeed a credit to customer service at Tesco.  Kind Regards   Caroline Reynolds & Theo",

I have a very poorly one year old and a very active 3 year old and needed to get to Tesco to collect medication and do a quick food shop! I go to my local Tesco in Twickenham to find that the car park is FULL of cars that do not belong to Tesco customers but to people that have gone to watch the rugby! Cars where parked on path ways  in front of trolley parks and to top it off not one car in the parent and child spaces had car seats in them....meaning they had no children with them! When I approached a member of staff he laughed at me  and asked me what I wanted him to do?!?!? While continuing to eat his pringles!!! It took me 25 mins just to get out the car park and get on my way to the next Tesco.   I then go to Tesco in Osterley....car park pretty busy...disabled bays and parent and child spaces filled with dumped trolleys! I finally find a space and do my shopping..... At the check out the young lady serving me did not offer any help...gave me only 3 bags for a full weeks worth of shopping  and kept shouting to other members of staff to ask when her break was! She scanned my shopping so fast and was asking about her break so much she ignored the fact I was asking for more bags and that my shopping was piling up with no where for me to put it! To make things even worse I get home and find that she didn t even scan my coupons and that I had been charged in full for everything!  What an awful service and truly stressful experience! Looks like I ll be going to Sainsbury s from now one!!!! \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21",

Today me my partner and my 13month old daughter went shopping and found a Teltubbie lala sing along toy which we decided to buy for our daughter. She played with it all round the store until we got to the checkout  she loved it. As we went to pay for the item the chashier told us it would not scan. He then gave it to my daughter anyway and asked a colleague to find a replacement that would scan.  She eventually came back to inform us all of those toys were not filed and could not be sold which then meant she had to take it from my daughter who was very upset and confused.   This has completely angered me. I would like to know why the toys are out to be bought and not even filed on the system and also how this will be rectified as it has caused unnecessary upset to my daughter.",

We ve just gone to wrap it up for Christmas  and as we pulled the tags off it prior to wrapping  a piece of stuffing came out with it! After much pulling we finally got all of the stuffing out of the toy  which is shown in the attached photo  with my hand for reference on size/amount. As I said  this is the third of this type of toy we ve bought from the wisbech store  and the two before did not come with stuffing (nor does a rubber squeaky toy need it!). If we hadnt have caught this  there is a good chance our dog would have eaten at least some of it once her teeth inevitably broke through the rubber! If it had been a soft toy  i would expect to be on the lookout for stuffing as she played with it  but not a rubber chew toy. Can this be investigated  because to us as dog owners this is a major design flaw  and potentially harmful to pets.",

We where then approached by a male worker (I think from the same counter or a nearby one) who told me he was a retired paramedic  and could he take a look. He was very friendly and joked with my son.

  "post_message": "Today s tesco experience:I received my tesco Christmas savers vouchers today. No extra vouchers e.g 25 extra points when you buy cheese etc. No clubcard boost offers. Went in store to Long Eaton. The store is being upgraded to included several LADIES clothes shops  Dorothy Perkins etc. During these process they have made all of the aisles much smaller so less trollies and them stupid dot com wagons just cannot fit. Not only that but the various cages and whatever else hanging about.  Then I went down the chocolate aisle and one of the boxes fell off the shelf (minor accident) not a problem and I picked them up. What stunned me was the manager in the stripy shirt who turned round looked at me and walked off  no offer of help. Then go to the bread aisle  dot com trolley picking bread  the guy picked up one loaf decided it was the wrong one and just shoved it on any shelf  did this three times. Slightly disappointing. I ve held out over these past few weeks while the store is in absolute chaos but I think I m done now and this will be my last shop here.",

There approximately 10 spaces and I often see them being used by people with no children simply because its directly in front of the store. I have a 5 month old child and regularly have to park in normal spaces because people are lazy  when I have that rare time when i am child free i use the appropriate spaces. I am not saying we are more important than disabled people (their need is of course greater) but there does seem to be an abundance of spaces for them and not a realistic or comparable amount for parents.

But weighing them the first one was 60g and the second which i got a picture if was 50g with loads of cream still in the box. For a lot of people this would be a good thing but add someone really trying to lose weight things like this really don t help  luckily I weighed it so only ate half but I know of lots of people who ready these thinking they are 117cals in total.

The bread has been unavailable for a couple of weeks and now reappeared as a new recipe. However  whilst the previous loaf was excellent and great value for gluten free bread at \u00a32  the new version is totally tasteless  very stodgy and solid and the slices are about two thirds of the size  whilst the weight I believe is the same  which show how heavy each slice is. Tesco always ask for feedback  good or bad and on this occasion I can only say the new recipe is disastrous! Increasing number of us now buy gluten free bread either because of coeliac disease like myself  or other intolerances and I know many people who are extremely disappointed. I would welcome your comments on this matter. How about reverting back to the original recipe? If not I m afraid I will be purchasing a different brand in future. Photo below shows barcode so we are clear on the product but I have heard similar tales regarding the white and brown loaves too.",

Ava  my 5 year old daughter  has made friends with the man who delivers our Tesco shopping. She absolutely adores him and they always have a lovely chat if she is at home when he comes and they really make each other laugh. Today she was at school when he came. He asked after her and I told him about all the blood tests she has had and her horrific nosebleeds and how very brave she has been. He was very sad to hear she wasn t well. Later on in the afternoon he came back to tell her that he and his friends at work thought she was so brave and a bit of a hero and presented her with a giant tub of Cadburys  Heroes as a gift from them. Robbie  the tall Tesco man    Ava is so happy and I am sorry I cried \ud83d\ude0a Good people do still exist!  I think Robbie deserves a Christmas bonus.  He has made a little girl s day",

Then when our business is concluded we drive back to the Tesco car park to pick up my wife   your car park is always so crowded   then we leave by the same route as we entered. In order that you don t make the same mistake again we will endeavour to avoid all your shops because let s face it who can afford \u00a370 on top of your extortionate prices.

I was informed  along with the lovely old lady in front of me  that that stop serving hot food  ie pretty much their menu at 5pm so they can get tidied down so they can leave at six.  Ultimately we all left bemused why a cafe would stop serving at a prime time of day  little pee d off because the guy on the counter was pretty unfriendly and more concerned he could get out the door on time and more than anything HUNGRY.  I can not understand why A) Tesco Cafe would want to lose trade  and money in the till? B)  other cafes in Tesco s stay open till 7 and serve until 6.45  I know this as my wife s grandmother works in one.  C)  bother displaying opening times as they in effect close at 5 not 6pm as stated? D) think is acceptable to offer people who want a hot cooked meal  a cake or crisps as a substitute?  I like Tesco  we shop there regularly  its local and selection of products of goods is great. But this Cafe takes the biscuit  which ironically is pretty much what you can get in there at dinnertime.",

The lady at the checkout asked me whether it was an old one or a new one. I was puzzled by her question  being naive not knowing why she felt the need to ask me such question. I replied that it was an old one. She then gave me a disapproving look and was unfriendly to me. That was when I started to realise that she must have thought I stole the bag! I am a very neat person and I always fold my bag for life neatly and nicely. Yes  it looks nice and new. I felt so insulted  but too embarrassed to say anything. Do  your staff really need to treat a customer like that?

Apparently customers get free parking if they spend \u00a35 in store  but this does not include tobacco  lottery or baby milk.   This is incredible. A \u00a35 spend is \u00a35  whatever it is spent on. Why does Tesco feel it has any right to tell parents what milk is acceptable? Apparently this is something to do with British law and not being seen to promote formula feeding.  Shops are retailers  not moral guardians. If they really think formula milk (or tobacco and lottery tickets) are unacceptable  maybe they shouldn t sell them. And let us go to shops that do want to sell them.",

  "post_message": "An ode to Tesco   As an adult sometimes you have to do things that you really do not fancy  like for example grocery shopping if you don\u2019t want an empty pantry  and though the thought of pushing around a heavy trolley is a bore  it\u2019s not my favourite past time  but it\u2019s a necessary \u2018adulting\u2019 chore. I choose to shop with Tesco and collect points on my ClubCard the thought that I being rewarded makes the shopping trip less hard.  This year I\u2019ve save up all my vouchers and then  when I had a nice amount to spend I decided to treat my little daughter to a snazzy little friend.   I ordered her a BeatBot Belle and we chose to collect in store because we\u2019re busy girls and did not want to miss her arriving at our door.  The text came through to say that BeatBot Belle was waiting  please come and get her and so when we had the time to spare we drove to the store together.   When we got BeatBot Belle home  we opened her that night  it didn\u2019t take us very long to discover that something was not right   I\u2019m handy  so I took her to the kitchen to start a full investigation the batteries had leaked!  I didn\u2019t want to complain or cause frustration to my little girl (who at 15 months does not much enjoy waiting)  So I cleaned the chamber and changed the batteries with no hesitating.  BeatBot Belle sprung into life but still  there was something wrong BeatrBot Belle couldn\u2019t make it to the end of any of her songs. Now to most parents this will seem a blessing  these toys \u2013 they do go on... and you seem to spend your whole life humming along to their song   and you wonder with all the new tunes that get lodged inside you head  what information are you losing to make space for them instead?!  But that\u2019s not the point  I really couldn\u2019t let this baby of mine  have a counting toy that gives up once it gets to number 9; It seems that battery acid has probably been the downfall of this toy   and so I took to twitter and spoke to a friendly  helpful boy  who said he would order a replacement that would be delivered the next day  between 7am and 7pm and they\u2019d take the old BeatBot Belle away.  A 12 hour window is not ideal when you\u2019re two girls who like to get out and play but I made provisions to keep a 15 month old entertained at home for one whole day. Imagine the disappointment at 7:30pm when it became quite clear  that on that day a delivery was not taking place here.   Again took to twitter looking for someone to shed some light  that is when I saw there had been a problem  there was a problem with order placed last night.An insincere  \u2018apologies you were not informed\u2019 I was told - Clearly this lady has not spend a day with a cabin-fevered 15 month old!  The order has been re-made and after 3pm this afternoon we should be able to collect our new BeatBot Belle and give the poor  confused one back to you  \u2026But what really does upset is not the problem but the way that the customer service agent dealt with me that day. It was expected that today I\u2019d want to wait in for a potential 12 hour slot without any hope or confidence that we would not be forgot.

  "post_message": "An Ode to Tesco...  As an adult sometimes you have to do things that you really do not fancy   like for example grocery shopping if you don\u2019t want an empty pantry  and though the thought of pushing around a heavy trolley is a bore    it\u2019s not my favourite past time  but it\u2019s a necessary \u2018adulting\u2019 chore. I choose to shop with Tesco and collect points on my ClubCard the thought that I being rewarded makes the shopping trip less hard. This year I\u2019ve save up all my vouchers and then  when I had a nice amount to spend I decided to treat my little daughter to a snazzy little friend.   I ordered her a BeatBot Belle and we chose to collect in store because we\u2019re busy girls and did not want to miss her arriving at our door.  The text came through to say that BeatBot Belle was waiting  please come and get her and so when we had the time to spare we drove to the store together.   When we got BeatBot Belle home  we opened her that night  it didn\u2019t take us very long to discover that something was not right   I\u2019m handy  so I took her to the kitchen to start a full investigation the batteries had leaked!  I didn\u2019t want to complain or cause frustration to my little girl (who at 15 months does not much enjoy waiting)  So I cleaned the chamber and changed the batteries with no hesitating. BeatBot Belle sprung into life but still  there was something wrong BeatrBot Belle couldn\u2019t make it to the end of any of her songs. Now to most parents this will seem a blessing  these toys \u2013 they do go  and you seem to spend your whole life humming along to their song   and you wonder with all the new tunes that get lodged inside you head  what information are you losing to make space for them instead?!  But that\u2019s not the point  I really couldn\u2019t let this baby of mine  have a counting toy that gives up once it gets to number 9; It seems that battery acid has probably been the downfall of this toy   and so I took to twitter and spoke to a friendly  helpful boy  who said he would order a replacement that would be delivered the next day  between 7am and 7pm and they\u2019d take the old BeatBot Belle away. A 12 hour window is not ideal when you\u2019re two girls who like to get out and play but I made provisions to keep a 15 month old entertained at home for one whole day. Imagine the disappointment at 7:30pm when it became quite clear  that on that day a delivery was not taking place here.  Again took to twitter looking for someone to shed some light  that is when I saw there had been a problem  there was a problem with order placed last night. An insincere  \u2018apologies you were not informed\u2019 I was told - Clearly this lady has not spend a day with a cabin-fevered 15 month old!  The order has been re-made and after 3pm this afternoon we should be able to collect our new BeatBot Belle and give the poor  confused one back to you  \u2026But what really does upset is not the problem but the way that the customer service agent dealt with me that day. It was expected that today I\u2019d want to wait in for a potential 12 hour slot without any hope or confidence that we would not be forgot. And that no real apology was offered for our wasted time and so that\u2019s the real reason of this (not to little rhyme). I asked 3 times for an official place where I could formally complain   each time the ladies answer to me was always just the same  that she will feed my comments back  I said I wanted to do it personally but 3 times she failed to provide those contact details for me.

I have never heard such rubbish. Even a supervisor was called who agreed with me but still said that s what the till was showing so couldn t help me.  I asked them to bring the pharmacist to the checkout - this was refused.  What they wanted me to do was purchase my shopping and then come back into store  pick up the strepsils from the checkout  queue at the pharmacy and then purchase items.  #dissappointedagain",

This on its own is a task in itself as it is two busses away from where I live but it s much cheaper than my local waitrose.. I used the scan and shop service and as I got to the check out and asked the woman if there was a tag on my scarf as I didn t want to get home and find there was one. She took it away and ran it over the unit thing and said there wasn t a tag in it as it would of beeped.. alas I have got home  and found a big ugly black tag in said scarf. Normally it wouldn t bother me  but I d bought it because I ve got a rotten cold and a twenty minute walk to the school to pick my children up. As I can t easily nip back and get the tag off.. I m now left with a scarf I can t use and I m  \u00a312 out of pocket.. unimpressed.",

  "post_message": "Long story short don t bother with Tesco home delivery service. Only been using them for a month and have had three time slots missed  each time being due to Tesco vans breaking down  (which makes me come to the conclusion that they don t maintain them very well). Tesco send text messages notifications of new arrangements  but with no contact information to talk to anyone. I again make another assumption that this is because they don t want people to ring up and tell them that this is unsatisfactory or inconvenient.   On talking with the customer service department the only option is to either wait for the new time slot that Tesco have chosen or to cancel. They have no capacity to make any amendments on the day that suit us the customer but they can make amendments which suit them. I am not allow to go to store and collect the items  I can t have it rearranged for another slot of my choosing today because that might potential mean that other people might also cancel. Yet the only option that I am getting is to cancel my order for today  because Tesco computer system won t allow for such changes. In other words the computer says no!!!!!    I have chosen home delivery because I have a 6 week old baby and it can be difficult to get to store.   Your customer service is appalling. If you re going to mess with customers plans you need to either  A) have vans that don t keep breaking down  or have some spare to account for break downs. B) allow customers to change to another time slot on the same day that suits them or C) allow people to go and collect it from store instead. Just saying cancelling is a rubbish option which doesn t help your customers.   Overall my 12 month ordering subscription will be cancelled.",

This he did and was offered work at the Bramley store. He had an induction day  signed forms and has a uniform hanging in his wardrobe. So far so good. Sadly this was in October  he is still waiting to hear from you. He has submitted his right to work documents  to the external company on several occassions  but some how those documents have gone missing. I have spoken to a member of staff from personnel three weeks ago (Wendy Grey) from the Seacroft branch who advised submitting again on another link. Again this has not worked. My so has contacted the store manager on several occasions to no avail. He has suggested applying for a new position using the store managers if code. All in all the experience has been poor  at least one other young adult who passed the course in September has not started work  my son now risks sanctions from his benefit  though he has done nothing wrong  he has done everything asked of him. The store manager at Bramley wants him to work too. Please Tesco  respond to this message  chase and investigate your vetting company  and PLEASE give my son the job he has studied for and won.",

Unfortunately nothing turned up  after calling at 6.30pm we was told the van had had an accident and we may have to re-book for 6-7pm today  but there was still a possibility that we may get our shopping.  We waited till 9.30pm and called again as time was getting on.  Spoke to a woman who put us on hold to call the store to see if it was coming.  We was told she spoke to the store manager who confirmed they are out on delivery and are definitely coming tonight but with no ETA. 11.30pm came and we gave up and went to bed as I have to be up at 4.30am for work.  We gathered it was re-booked for today at 6-7pm.  Today I was talking to a friend who lives up the road from me  literally 30 seconds drive. He received his tesco shopping yesterday just after 7pm.  So today nothing turned up again.  7.20pm my partner called up to find out where our shopping was. She was told the payment hasn t gone through  after my partner explained you took the money and its gone from our account she was told you take the money but only to refund it which takes 3-5 working days  then you try take it again the next morning. During this process you attempted to take payment 4 times this morning.  When I got home I called up and spoke to someone about the situation who was extremely helpful. He done all he could but unfortunately there was not much he could do without taking more money. Which I have to go to the bank to put in and at 8.15pm isn t possible. He gave me \u00a325 compensation which will also take 3-5 days.  I understand accidents happen  but its how a company as large as yourselves deals with the situation. It happened to me about a year ago with asda  the store manager personally drove her own car to deliver my shopping.  Why do you have a van up the road at 7pm and another down the other end (if it arrived) who plans your routes ? Why refund something and try to retake a matter of hours later but not attempting once but four times.  Your service has been appalling.",

  "post_message": "Tesco   It takes a lot for me to complain about something. Apart from the time a wild Pikachu appeared on Pok\u00e9mon go and quickly evaded me  I really can t remember the last time I was stirred from anything other than a placid temperament  but today I am quite angry.  I m a regular shopper in your express store in Kensal Rise  London  almost daily in fact.  At the weekend I was in there with a couple of friends on the way home from the fireworks. I d stopped to buy tonic water.  After paying I was waiting near the exit  with my friends  for the last of them to finish up at the tills. The security guard approached us and said to me in no uncertain terms that I had NOT paid for my shopping. I was surprised as I d heard the machine beep when I paid with my contactless card. I don t mean to brag but I m no beginner at this paying thing  especially in your Kensal Rise shop. Hell I can even tell you which self service tills are your best option. Till 1 is a good work horse  as is 5 for that matter. 2&3 seem to dance some form of infuriating tango of only being able to accept card payments  and till number 4 normally behaves but sometimes only takes coin  you know  if you re ever in there.  I m digressing. The security guard was insistent I hadn t paid and escorted me back to the tills. Starting to feel a little embarrassed I asked if he was sure I wouldn t be charged twice. Again  he very publicly insisted I hadn t paid. So  with the eyes of the shop on me  I foolishly took out the tonic water from my bag and paid once again.  I asked a final time if the security guard was sure I wouldn t be charged twice  and even more rudely this time  he told me I hadn t been charged once yet.  So  you can imagine my surprise this morning when I checked my online banking to see I have been charged TWICE.  I m not too miffed about the double charging of the 63p slimline tonic water  I ll make my financiers aware of the slip up and we ll power through. I am very displeased at the approach of your staff in the Kensal Rise store though. I was made to feel like a bit of a mug last weekend which I thought was a bit unprofessional at the time. Still  I could have made a mistake with the machines and walked away without paying by accident. Now that it turns out I had done nothing wrong  I feel that your staff should have double checked the records to see if I had paid rather than just accusing me straight off the bat and marching me back to the tills. Surely the self service machines have those capabilities?   Overall  I am unimpressed and thought you ought to know.  Steph",

Unfortunately I m not sure of his name but... yesterday we had a Tesco delivery arrive whilst I wasn t at home  my mum was looking after my 2yr old son at our house when the delivery arrived. I hadn t placed an order and when it was being unpacked my mum realised as she saw the name on the order and the address. So she told the driver and they packed it back up to take to the correct address. However during the time it was unpacked my little boy saw a Thomas the Tank Engine Magazine and a toy train attached to it and was beside himself when he realised it wasn t his and was going back. Later that evening when we were having dinner and myself and my husband were back  we had a knock at the door... it was the delivery driver from earlier who had bought my little boy another Thomas magazine!  It s not often someone would do something like that nowadays and I just thought he should be recognised for his kindness and thoughtfulness!! I did pop in store today to say thank you but unfortunately we didnt see the name badge so couldn t say for definite who it was.... but thank you!! You made a little boy very very happy \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03 I also thought with all the negative complaints these days it s  lovely to see not everyone and every company is the same!

  "post_message": "Hey Tesco UK!  Forgive me  I m just a tourist over here and I might not be fully aware of British customs but I m bit surprised how you guys are promoting healthy eating habits.  We re enjoying a couple of days in Canterbury and  you know  tight budget  we decided to visit your store to get a sandwich and a drink. We found the refridgerator and took some fruit juice (\u00a31.19) and a sandwich (\u00a32.20). Together \u00a33.39 and the \u00a33 Meal Deal brings that down to  well  \u00a33. Sounds nice! We went to pay and there - surprise: \u00a36.93 (2 Meal Deals). Uhm... but wasn t it supposed to be \u00a36? The gentleman at the cash desk explained:  That price applies to a complete meal package and yours is not complete. It is a drink + sandwich + snack. You have to choose something more  like a chocolate bar or a bag of crisps.  You must be kidding me? Is this how Tesco promotes healthy eating habits?  Frankly speaking I also don t know how that makes sense   the employee added.  So we took some chocolate bars which we didn t need and which we don t plan to eat soon  but the price went down to \u00a36.  There s so much going on about healthy eating habits  your fellow Englishman Jamie Oliver is a warrior at this area  increasing concerns about obesitas  discussions about sugar tax... and what are you doing? We were happy to spend \u00a36 on 2 juices and 2 sandwiches but had to take chocolate bars as well or pay more.  Please be ashamed of yourselves  go back to school  do your homework again and correct this error (because I want to believe it s something you all just overlooked rather than producers of chocolate bars and crisps bribing you guys to force their products onto consumers).  I hope you (and other readers) will understand I m not crying about \u00a30.93 price difference here...",

Two of your staff there tonight  Karena and Danny \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 have gone over and above what is expected of customer services. Their kindness had me in tears. I had a home delivery and there was an exchange on some ice cream  my son needs to eat the free from range and without really checking my husband accepted the exchange. however  the exchange ice creams have hazelnuts in which our son is severely allergic to. He is anaphylactic to them and stops breathing which  is as you can only imagine quite difficult so we don t have any nut products in the house. I decided to try and take them back to our local store in Gosport and knowing that the delivery didn t come from them I went up to the counter and explain the situation. Karena and Danny said the situation could be sorted and they would never want to see a little boy sad in the morning  this store doesn t even stock the free from ice creams i was returning!!!  they stop the ones that my son can eat. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01These two people s kindness is beyond special for a Mummy that find buying food so so difficult for a little boy that just wants to be as normal as possible and eating ice cream \ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66 is one of the things little boys do.

I appreciate it might not of been noticed  but a little help and understanding would of been appreciated. Then I asked to see the manager  no manager in store I was told! Matts colleague then appeared and sniggered behind the till  I caught them both laughing when I came back. I have never been treated with such disrespect  Matt has attitude  I heard the way he spoke to other customers  and your other member of staff turned up at the till just to laugh.

Didn t realise that when it said for delivery it really meant  not this price in store  - travelled to your Leeds store to purchase (passing other supermarkets on the way) only to walk in and find it at a higher price. Needless to say I didn t buy it as I was beyond annoyed and felt duped to be honest. Is this kind of pricing approach really necessary? If it is you should make it clearer that the price in store is going to be different. Number 836 of why I no longer shop at Tesco!!

  "post_message": "Help reduce plastic pollution in UK rivers and seas by asking retailers to switch own-brand cotton bud stems from plastic to paper.  Why is this important?  Plastic cotton bud stems are the number one item of plastic  sewage-related debris on our beaches and rivers [1] - yet retailers could help prevent this by switching the stick from plastic to paper.  In the marine environment  plastics can be eaten by marine life  often with fatal consequences. Plastic is found in the stomachs of Loggerhead Turtles  Seabirds and many species of UK-caught fish. And pieces that don t get eaten break down into microplastics  forming part of a dangerous plastic smog in our seas.  Retailers are listening - earlier this year  Waitrose and Johnson & Johnson announced they d make the change to paper  and the Coop and Marks and Spencers sell paper-stem buds. Now we need to make sure the others do the same.  Tesco  Sainsburys  Boots  ASDA  Morrisons  Lidl  Aldi  Superdrug and Wilko are currently reviewing their policies on cotton buds ... which is why we need to show them how many of us support the switch to paper!  Even paper stem cotton buds shouldn\u2019t be flushed down the loo. But if they are  they re less likely to pass through sewage filters and will quickly biodegrade if they escape",

Today it was a notebook   on the shelf it said \u00a31    i thought it was wrong so i had to ask   the price was \u00a34 . Just a bit of difference maybe but for a pensioner it may be the difference between being able to pay for my goods at the til or not and then holding everyone up .

If you really cannot spare a member of staff to keep this stocked up - then surely it would be kinder to remove it and announce you are no longer doing this offer?  Last week there was no fruit in the box on Monday  Tuesday  Thursday or Friday when I was in the store - although  of course  they may have been topped up later.  Just make a decision please!",

All other items out of stock. Asked a young lad about one item  who was very helpful. Asked 2 girls about another item  they told me to go to  around aisle 21  to look for it before continuing their chat  apologies for interrupting your conversation girls! Went to Pharmacy to collect my repeat prescription that was sent electronically to them from my GP on 25th October. Was asked to come back for it and they would have it ready. There were 5 staff behind the counter  but they claimed they were short of staff and thats why it wasnt ready. Oh and by the way  I know its important to stock the shelves  but to ignore people waiting then stop the stock up to speak to a staff member that comes to the counter?

  "post_message": "Yesterday we were disappointed to receive a letter from Highview Parking on behalf of Tesco telling us we would be charged \u00a370 (\u00a340 if we pay early) for using their carpark at Silverburn for over 3 hours. I was totally unaware of any time limits and assumed  as many would  that this carpark is free like the rest of Silverburns parking. I understand that you do this to deter people using the shopping centre and not going into your store but when we do use it for our Tesco shop aswell  it s a kick in the teeth. On many occasions we park here to go to the shopping centre/cinema and then into Tesco to do our weekly shop. Do you suggest we park further down  have a wander around the shops  go back to the car  then drive up to the top of the carpark where I suppose we must cross the threshold into the  Tesco carpark  to go and do our shop. In this letter it was stated that we had infact gone over the time limit before but were let off. Might I suggest that you ask the company you employ to manage your carpark  to send out a letter the first time informing your customers of their indiscretion and be careful to not let it happen a second time to avoid a fine. You can be assured that we will no longer be using Tesco for our weekly shop. My husband and I have informed our family  friends and colleagues whom we know use Silverburn and Tesco and not one of them knew about this time limit and have told us that they will no longer shop with Tesco. We are really disappointed and feel this a cheap way for you to make money off your customers.",

  "post_message": "Hiya  on the 7th November 2016 me  my mum and my 10 month old son went shopping at Tesco in Burnley on Centenary Way. We decided to use the handheld scanners and went around scanning all our shopping as we do normally. Everything was fine. We went to the check out with our shopping at roughly 9:15pm. At the check out I was served first for a few bits I d got while my mum queued behind me. A cashier then called my mum over to the next till as there was a large queue behind her. My mum went over to the cashier and I bought my shopping placed it upon the pram and then went over to my mum. As I got there the cashier serving my mum had taken the scanner and then performed  the random check that came up. The cashier then went back to the till and told us the total to pay is\u00a315 something. After being told this my mum replied that the total was not right it should be more. The woman then said very promptly that we hadn t scanned the milk for starters. I told her that I had and there must be some mistake. She then told us we hadn t scanned quite a few of the items (which I knew we had) and was ordered to put all our shopping on the check out. She went through all the items that came up on her display and put them to the side. There were quite a few items that hadn t come up on her display. The cashier then asked Again if we had scanned the items on the handheld scanner in I dubious demeanour  to which I responded that i had checked the scanner myself just before coming to the check out with my mum. She proceeded to call a security guard (1) over. She told him that we hadn t scanned a lot of items through and he questioned me on whether I had in fact actually scanned these so called unscanned items (as I usually use the scanners for my mum with her being a lady of a certain age)  to which I replied that I did. I had checked  the whole list on the display of the scanner after finishing our shopping before proceeding to the check out. I then told them that i could remember the total and it should be \u00a336.70 something. More Tesco workers crowded round us watching what was happening along other shoppers like some sort of big event was happening. This made me and my mum feel extremely  intimated  uncomfortable and embarrassed  worse was us having my 10 month old son asleep with us in his pram. One of the Tesco staff members who came to spectate (after the security guards was summoned) then pointed to my son s pram and said she got all these on her pram. To which I told her I had bought them separately just before my mum and I had the receipt for. She then went quiet and stood next to the cashier and continued to spectate. The security guard (1) then called for another security guard (2) to come talk to us which then made us worried futher. In the meantime the cashier at the check out was turning other customers away saying she had a problem with us  so they were all staring as we had security guards and tesco staff around us. The security guard (2) came and spoke with the cashier. She told him we hadn t scanned the items through in a way that made it sound as though i had done this deliberately to avoid payment for some  of our items  despite the fact of my mum telling the cashier that the total was wrong in the first place and they must be an error when told the shopping came to \u00a315 something. The cashier said I hadn t scanned half the items because they are not showing on her display. The security guard  (2) then asked me if I scanned the items to which again I said that I had and that shopping should total \u00a336.70 something as shown on the scanner before we gave it the cashier. The cashier then inturpted us to asked the security guard (2) if she should proceed to void the sale and let them deal with us to which the security guard (2) then ask her to scan all the items before they  dealed with us  to see what the amount of the shopping totaled to see if what we had said the handheld scanner total had said and unsurprisingly to us when she did this (which she should of done in the first place)  the total of the items came to \u00a336.72. She then asked the security guard (2) what she should do. The security guard (2) said then to the cashier  that it s fine  turned to us for a split second and said the words I m sorry (nothing else) before promptly walking away. The rest of the staff who was watching us like a major event was going on just then all went away. The cashier then apologised to JUST my mum and said she d never known the scanning system to do this before and then finally allowed to purchase our items. We was stopped at your tills for 15-20 minutes whilst this was resolved which led to my mum missing her bus home leaving us with no option to sit on the bench at the end of the check outs where my mum was almost in tears until other travel arrangements was arranged. Not really what I expect when I go to do my shopping with yourselves  and i think it s appalling customer service. For me to have to be made to feel that way with my baby was bad  but my mum is 62 years of age  that is disgraceful........ please feel free to review your cctv where you will see me clearly scanning all items for both me and my mum.",

  "post_message": "A true case of mistaken identity!!   Whilst shopping in your lovely Brislington store last week I picked up this rather handsome looking tomato along with five of its pals!  Loose pickings from the small remainder of what were meant to be vine tomatoes!! Carefully I removed the little green stalks and any remaining vines (these dastardly bits can cause havoc to the skin of their pals if a stray vegetable happens to roll upon them whilst I experience a small bit of trolley rage!!) and loaded up my trolley with the rest of my bits and pieces!  I nursed these tomatoes the whole way round the store and made it to the checkout with all six still intact- no stalks and vines you see :) as my goods are bleeping their way through the checkout I happen to look up as the delightful red tommys are being bleeped through and I see the screen says \u00a34.80 - beef tomatoes!!! I said-  they seem like very expensive tomatoes to me and these are not beef tomatoes  to which Mr checkout guy says-  this is the only option I can see on the screen . I trotted off back to where I picked up my six tommys and removed the label from the shelf and took back a proper beef tomato for good measure! Mr checkout guy said-  oh yes- the vine tomatoes- I didn t recognise them because they weren t attached to a vine!   Surely everyone knows a beef tomato is like the Incredible Hulk of the tomato world- obviously not!! Anyway  me and my six tomatoes made it home in one piece and five of them were cooked up into a delicious dish!! This one will form part of a sandwich tomorrow :)  perhaps some lessons to be learnt in tomato knowledge for some and for others- keep your eye on the screen and check the receipt!!   I still love you Tesco and good on you for your  perfectly imperfect  range :)",

  "post_message": "Last Monday I popped into Tesco s in Walsall with my mom and little boy to get a few last minute bits for our Halloween party. My son who is 3 was having a bit of a meltdown he was tired  fed up and excited for the party. He was in the trolley having a cry while I was trying to  scan my items through the self serve as fast as possible so we could get out before irritating all the other shoppers. One of your sales assistants called James came over and tried to talk to my son  then he disappeared round the tills and came back with a store catalogue filled with toys and stickers to stick on the toys you like. He instantly stopped crying settled down and was engrossed in the pictures of superheroes that James had found. This in itself was great customer service  but James didn t stop there. He asked what fruit Noah liked and ran off to fetch him a banana and told us about their fresh fruit for kids policy. I haven t experienced customer service like this ever before. He is a credit to Tesco and I hope you will thank him again for me  he definitely deserves some kind of recognition.  (This was about 2:40pm Monday 31st oct.)",

I made my purchase to be told that this doesn t qualify me for a parking ticket. The threshold for parking is \u00a35  I did not realise you stipulated what I can and cannot purchase in order to pay for parking  The baby milk cost me \u00a311 and therefore I don t understand why this wasn t a large enough purchase. I then had to wait at customer services whilst they insisted it wasn t a purchase that covered the cost of parking. I was eventually given a ticket for parking. However this service is not acceptable for families with newborn babies; when visiting the supermarket is stressful enough!   Feeding my baby is essential and therefore so is the purchase of milk; please can you explain why this vital item is not included ?   I look forward to hearing your answer.",

Was told to carry on with my shopping  which i did then told she couldnt find it.  Returned to the store saturday lunchtime  waited in the queue  finally got served then to be told she still couldnt find it and then you had a powercut so had to leave the store again without my prescription.  Returned this morning at 7.56 to be told sorry we dont open til 8 and again couldnt have my prescription. The store is also so higgledi piggeldi in its layout and now difficult to find anything and do the staff actually fill up the ready made sandwiches as the choice is alot of the time absolutely dire.   Not impressed at all and am thinkin of starting my shopping traps to morrisons. I have used your store for god knows how many years.",

The lady did not tell me the price so I just placed card into machine and entered pin. Upon reviewing the receipt later I found I had been charged 5.25 too much. There appears to be a transaction  for 7 bags of Monster Munch at the top of the receipt. There is then a Total for this of \u00a35.25. Following this is my actual transaction the total of which has been combined with the Monster Munch. I did not purchase any Monster Munch (CCTV will confirm this) and I am quite angry to be charged over \u00a35 for something that is not mine. Please advise how I go getting my money back??

At the first glance I get excited seeing cakes and sweet snacks which I ve never been able to eat. But then I get really disappointed when it soley says gluten free and wheat free on the packaging and find that its not actually dairy free.  I m sure alot of other people feel like this. To be honest I shop more in Sainsburys and Asda for freefrom products because I feel like they actually have products which are both gluten and dairy free. That way no one is dissappointed.  I think Tesco need to do this too! You need make your freefrom products completely free from gluten and dairy. You ll appeal to more people that way. This goes for your Tesco finest gluten free range too  it would be nice if they were dairy free. Let me know what you think of my feedback. Thanks  Anisha",

I ve added a picture below showing where the pull up is tearing  the part that is supposed to tear when u take the pull up off isn t tearing it s the seam at the front of the nappie. They just seem to be very poor quality and I won t be wasting money on these again and will post to other parent forums warning them too.  In the picture below my thumb is on the part that you tear when taking the nappie off. These are tearing when we try and put them on my daughter.",

Young lad behind the till mousy brown hair must of been 17/18 asked me to give him my basket while he put it all through for me bagged it up for me chatted to me about my day smiled at me and made me feel normal. This may not seem lie much but my anxiety was playing up and I find it hard to leave the house alone with the girls and I just wanted to let this young lad know that him just doing something really small really made my day and made me feel human and I want to thank him and let him know his kindness did not go unnoticed.

After a fab makeover just a few years ago  the department tills made purchasing and exchanging clothes a much better experience. I believe the decision to remove the tills and force customers to purchase clothes at the checkouts and queue at customer services for exchanges and refunds to be a step backwards and a very bad move. Sending my sympathies to the long term F&F staff who have been made redundant as a result.",

These are sold off the shelf  not over the pharmacy counter (OTC) or by prescription only (POM).  I needed 4 packs and there were only two  damaged packs on the shelf in the aisle.  But there were multiple  undamaged packs behind the counter in the pharmacy. I needed these for my dog  who is on high doses on corticosteroids (prednisolone) due to an autoimmune disease and the vet told me I could purchase these off the shelf in any large supermarket at a fraction of the price she would have to charge. BUT  the pharmacist refused to sell me exactly the same  undamaged packs because it was  against pharmacy regulations . So  Tesco  why did your pharmacy technician refuse to let me buy a product that you were already stocking on the shelves in your aisle? This makes no sense at all and is certainly NOT against pharmacy regulations.  GROWL......",

Imagine my surprise when I was informed by my parents that I was  too old  for a birthday cake! After celebrating with my friends this weekend I returned home and decided to nip to Tesco to buy myself a cake just for me! Because I was in such a bad mood I ran in to the shop grabbed a cake off the shelf and some chocolate and came home for my tea. After eating my tea I decided to cut myself a nice piece of my Paw Patrol cake but on taking a bite I realised it was stale and hard.  Immediately I checked the date on the box and it was the 13th November so I had at least another week to eat my cake! On closer inspection I found a hole the size of a finger that has obviously let air into the box and made my cake stale \ud83d\ude22 Happy Birthday to me From Tesco \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b",

Upon removing the packaging I discovered that all the skin has been cut/torn away around the neck cavity so it cannot be stuffed. I ve encountered this problem several times before and I don t understand why the packaging/label has to cover up this part of the bird so there is no way of telling if it has been properly prepared until it is unwrapped. I don t have time to make a 10 mile round trip to get it replaced and there would be no way of knowing if the replacement was the same anyway. It might not seem like a big deal but the stuffing is the part the children enjoy the most and Sunday dinner with grumpy kids is no fun at all.",

I know  she thought I\u2019ll warm my tum with a fine gf spiced pear pie. So off she flew in the cold  cold wind across Tescoland to the extra store in Corstorphine. Yes  boxes in plenty were stacked on the shelf. The fairy was happy with the thought of a full tum.   But no! shouted the fairy  the first box was a week out of date. Never mind thought the fairy  boxes were still on the shelf. She tried another one  and another. On and on the fairy laboured but all of the boxes were well out of date. The fairy was feeling weaker and weaker  she needed food to fill her small tum. Oh thought the fairy  I know what I\u2019ll do. A nice toasted gf bagel will suit just as well. She turned to the shelf  but alas and alack that shelf was as empty as her poor rumbling tum. Getting weaker and weaker she had a last thought  a gf chocolate muffin could do the trick. With tears in her eyes she reached for the shelf  but not one gf muffin was in sight..No gf muffins  no gf bagels and only pear pies that were out of date.   The tears started running  what would she do now. And then through the hunger a dim light arose. Back across Tescoland she would go. So to the Broughton Tesco she flew  her wings flapping slower and slower.   Yes there were the gf pear pies all lined up on the shelf. She felt stronger and stronger at the thought of the warm spicy pears in her tum. But no  surely it couldn\u2019t happen twice in one day. The first packet was out of date by two days  and the next and the next and the next more than week out of date. Surely there must be a packet to be had that was still in date.   Oh goodness what could she do know  her energy was low and the thought of trying a third Tesco Leith seemed too much to bear but then as her thoughts started to turn to the closest rival store she reached up on her very tiptoes and right at the back behind all of the boxes  she found just one box with at least one day left on its date. She took the box and flew from the store  home  home she thought and warmed up the pie almost as rare as gold dust.    As she ate it she thought  please  please Tescoland  I may be gf but I get as hungry as everyone else  please keep your stocks up to date or one day all the gf fairies will shop elsewhere for their favourite free from food.",

I ve found grass  nicely washed in with my watercress  then two other types of leaves in another bag  but this time it s what looks n feels like the inside of a snail shell...and it was in my tin of peas...do Tesco not have quality control  or hygiene in place?  the occasional mishap maybe  but come on  how did a snail shell get in a tin of peas  and more worryingly where is the rest of the shell and the snail? It s always been convenient to shop with Tesco  especially with home delivery  but I m beginning to think that maybe it would be safer and better for my health to shop elsewhere! come on Tesco...sort yourselves out!!",

My little girl picked it up excited as she loves the brand only for me to find this label on the back.  Not suitable for children adult product . Can you please explain. If it s deemed as a risk to children then perhaps you should not sell it. Or relocate it to the adult section  which of course would be rather odd. Thank you.",

  "post_message": "I am so disgusted with my local Tesco Express  I had to post this  even though I have phoned Customer Services and a very nice young man has spoken to the store and is sending me a gift card by way of apology.  This morning I bought The Sunday Times and several other items.  When I got home I reralised the newspaper seemed very thin.  No wonder!  Half of it was missing.  There was no Money  Travel  Home or other sections.  I rang the store  and the very abrupt  snotty assistant manager said very tersely there were signs in the store to say there were sections of the paper missing.  Well  not on top of the pile of Times there wasn t!  She said they had been left in the rain by Menzies  were soaking wet  and they were waiting for more to come in.  Well  my knowledge of Menzies tells me that no way will they deliver replacements on a Sunday!  She said to pop back later and I could pick them up  but could give no indication as to when (as I said - pigs might fly if they arrive).  She couldn t get me off the phone quick enough  was downright rude  and I have made a formal complaint about her unacceptable attitude.  BUT surely in a situation like this incomplete newspapers should not be put on sale at the full price?  She told Customer Services when I complained to them it was the supplements that were missing  but she is lying.  The supplements were there  wrapped in polythene  it was half of the main paper that was missing.  This is blatantly dishonest to let customers buy half a product at the full price when you know the paper is massively incomplete.  What is Tesco s policy on this sort of thing?  Fleece the customer?  I am still seething at the member of staff s attitude  and even more disgusted that she called herself Assistant Manager.",

  "post_message": "I am not normally one to complain but after missing items from my Click and Collect order again I feel compelled to advise you of the frustration I feel.  Yesterday I collected my order from your Tesco store Gunton  Lowestoft.  Four items from my order were missing.  I have phoned your helpline to be advised I will be refunded which to be honest I don t want.  This is not the first time this has happened and I have actually lost count of the times I have had things missing.  I now have to find time to back and get the missing items which is costing me time and petrol money as I live 3 miles away.  Why can t Tesco just put the missing items in one of their delivery trucks and get the driver to drop it off?  It s their incompetence and they should put it right.  I have two young children which don t particularly want to be dragged around a busy supermarket on a weekend which is why I done click and collect in the first place.  I am feeling very disheartened that this keeps happening and am wondering why I use Tesco when they can t get an order right.  I know people make mistakes however as I mentioned before this is not the first time.  I just feel that by offering a refund you are not solving the problem but you are simply giving your customer inconvenience.  I spend a lot of money each week and that counts for nothing it seems.",

  "post_message": "Hmmm...Interesting to see that the four packs of biscuits (EAN: 5010204464190 I bought from my local store this evening were each found to be one biscuit short when compared with two previously purchased packs that were already in my kitchen cupboard. The newer packs are clearly 6mm shorter in length  and thus at least one biscuit fewer.  Neither EAN  given pack weight  nor price has been adjusted to take this adjustment into account.      A quick calculation (Based on the count of 12 packs in an SRP box) shows that this gives Tesco just under one extra packet out of every two such boxes  or roughly one extra SRP box per pallet.  This also scales up negatively for the customer  who will inevitably wind up having to purchase an extra SRP box (At extra cost) to obtain the same quantity of product. As someone who consumes these at the rate of about two packets every three days  this extra volume in purchase will be encountered pretty darn sharpish. :-/      You didn t really expect customers not to notice this  did you? I hate to use a cliche  but this REALLY takes the biscuit! :-o :-p",

As you know a 9 year old can read pretty well. I was asked the question with a puzzling looking face. Mom why do they say love Santa. I personally don t think these are appropriate to be on the shelves because they cause a lot of questions from young kids. I was actually quite surprised and a bit angry to see something like this right next to selection boxes. I riggled myself out of it somehow but was hard. Were all trying to keep our children children for as long as we can and believing in Santa is a big thing. They grow up to fast. This makes things harder for parents. Maybe tesco can look into this and it could be done in a more suttle way?",

We called in to Tesco for petrol thinking we could use contactless payment via our phone but this was not the case  nor could we get cashback from the store using our phone.  Despite 3 or 4 members of staff  suggesting different ways of trying to help us out of our predicament  it seemed like there was not solution so we left the store (grateful for their help  but worried as to how to get home).  We were nearly at our car when the lady working on the security desk (sorry we didn t get your name) came running across the car park with another solution which we tried & it worked :-)    That the staff were so helpful initially was lovely  but the fact that the security lady carried on thinking of a solution and took the time and trouble to leave the store and fetch us to try it (when it would have been very easy just to let us go and try to figure it out on our own) was  to me  above and beyond.  I really wish we d thought to ask for your name so that I could mention it here - I do hope this message & our thanks finds its way to you (and your manager).  Keep up the great work!

  "post_message": "Poor customer service by Tesco today. We ordered a shop to be delivered between 2pm - 3pm we had planned this with a busy day  we got home at 1.30pm and waited for the shop to arrive. at 3.05pm we decided to ring customer service team to be told due to a driver phoning in sick we have had to call on another driver and it will now be between 3pm - 4pm we said this doesn t suit us today and we need to go out so we arranged for the time to be moved to tomorrow between 11am - 12pm. Just as we walked out the door the customer service team rang back and said the driver is on your road and you next drop. After agreeing this would be acceptable and we would wait. Another 25mins passed and still no shopping we decided at this point we would not wait any longer and rung back and said please move to tomorrow. We was told that we would be charged for today s shop and tomorrow and then have to wait 3 working days for a refund. (Why should we be out of pocket for your error) I work within customer service and all that was needed was a call/text saying we are sorry but we can t make the agreed time and agree another time. On the way out we drove around the road we lived to find no Tesco van. Very poor service.",

  "post_message": "I ve been a customer at your Brooklands store for years. But yesterday I felt like I was an inconvenience to your staff. I had a query about my receipt so I went to the customer service desk. The customer service desk is right next to the tobacco counter. 2 people were serving on it after 15 mins of waiting and my 4 year old son was having a meltdown not once was I acknowledged. In the end my husband went over and grabbed a member of staff (checkout supervisor I think) who came over and got one of the staff who were serving to see me (one of the 2 that ignored me whilst on tobacco counter) . The young lad that saw me was in such a fluster  although he gave me a refund it seemed he wasn t really taking any notice of my complaint and just wanted to get it over and done with. After years of working in retail myself  I find this shocking customer service - especially as its a designated customer service desk. If my son wasn t in such a state I would ve taken this up with the store general manager. Could you please pass this on to him/her please. Many thanks.",

They have to stand together as Sophie is the responsible adult as the cadets are under the age of 16. The store manger didn t even have the decency to speak to them himself!!!! I respect the fact the some people do not agree with poppies but it is actually raising money for charity.

A store to which has a large notoriety about it  especially in this post  so much notoriety that we and the children call it the devils store.  After arriving home  we tucked in to the toffee apples and to my utter horror and disgust a big fat caterpillar crawled out of the toffee apple that I  yes I  was enjoying  grabbed hold of me and dragged me inside the toffee apple.  Now I wouldn t have minded if the caterpillar had asked me first  would you like to adventure inside my toffee apple home dear sir?  But no  the detestable little oik just yanked me in with not a care to be had.  Now as you may know apples are quite dense and hard inside unlike a peach (that James was a lucky tike) and I suffered some bruising  now that wasn t the worst of it sir  oh no!  After he viscously pulled me in he took me to where I figure must have been the controls to fly his toffee apple craft and I was amazed to find that he had been shopping at asda (go figure right?) So I confronted him about this and he answered with  well  I do like an asda apple crumble  the cheek!!!! Anyway he flew me round for a bit  then dropped me back off at home  anyway my point is  why was this allowed to happen and why weren t the toffee apples checked before being put out of the stock room?  I am not only outraged but rather puzzled. Can you explain yourselves to me please?  Cheers.",

  "post_message": "Tesco  I am absolutely appalled by your costumer services. I went tonight  no less than 50minutes ago  to get some alcohol with my friend and younger brother. Once I got to the self-service  I was OF COURSE  prepared with ID  as was my friend  since WE were the ones buying and drinking the alcohol. The girl on the self-service instantly asked for my brothers ID. I was confused and explained it was not for him  nor would I ever buy alcohol for my UNDERAGE  baby brother  that we were the ones paying and we were the ones who BOTH had ID. I could understand her asking if my brother had been touching the bottles  carrying them or saying clearly which one he wanted. He did not  he just came along to get some food which we would get after the alcohol. I told her  it was not a company rule - but something a colleague would decide  both my friend and I work for another supermarket and know that if we were to treat a customer in such fashion  action against us would have been taken swiftly and we would have been punished. She called a manager over and I explained to him the situation - HE UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY  he did not have any reason to believe that I was buying it for my underage brother so he checked our ID s and approved it. The girl who had previously refused me  went to her other two colleagues - all three of which stood  giving us filthy looks and outright staring to the point where I had to tell the female manager there that they were making me very uncomfortable and could she please ask them to stop. This kind of behaviour is disgusting  not only to cause trouble in asking for ID  but to then purposefully attempt to make a customer feel distressed and uncomfortable. Absolutely disgraceful. I WILL be telling friends and family of the encounter  as well as anyone else who speaks of Tesco in a good light and I will not be coming back to your store (neither will my family) for such actions.  Unneeded!  (Friday the 4th  between 10 and 10.35  Tesco off Ipswich Road.)",

We had no intention of looking at the fish counter but it caught my 10 year old son s eye and George came over and showed my son the detail of each fish  the teeth  scales etc and even gave him gloves to hold each fish. The end result was my son having the enthusiasm to choose his own fish to bring home to eat.  George even wanted my son to let him know if he likes it. I know it was quiet but the time he put aside for my son was really appreciated and to see him excited about fish was great. Getting kids to eat anything healthy nowadays is so hard so thank you George!  Please pass on my comments and maybe reward him for great service as this should be encouraged. \ud83d\udc21 \ud83d\udc4f",

Apparently  this happens all the time  they have  consistently asked for the website to be changed but it never is  and  people always complain  Perhaps you can enlighten me as to why it is acceptable for this to happen  and what you plan to do about the fact that I have had a wasted journey  and am now going to have to return on your busiest day to collect a parcel due to an error on your part.

We often pass time of day with her and she came up to us and presented me with a beautiful bunch of flowers and said these are for you. You and your hubby have so much to deal with health wise and coping with the childrens needs that I felt this would brighten up your day. Yep you guessed it water works burst the banks and I was so overwhelmed at her thought that tears of joy slipped down my cheeks.

  "post_message": "Dear tesco  I am thoroughly disappointed with you. I stopped shopping with you a few months ago. But with the stand you took against unilever and with the promise of your  brand guarantee   I decided to give you another go. Imagine my disgust when I was charged 1.89 and 2.00 for 2 items that I could have bought from asda for 1.50 each. When I queried this in store   it was explained to me that you actually compare ALL branded items and even it out. So overall my basket of shopping was 2.20 cheaper than other supermarkets  but you don t tell me which products are cheaper and I m still charged the higher amount for 2 of the products I know for a fact are cheaper elsewhere. Our basket of shopping came to a grand total of \u00a3155.77. It s not pocket change  that s a lot of money. So a measly 0.89 pence has cost you 2 customers who used to spend in excess of \u00a3600 per month on groceries and another \u00a3160 per month in petrol. I have to travel further but the savings on my shopping bill make it worth while.",

  "post_message": "I have just been looking at your new clothing ranges. Very cute. Although I notice that there are 200 and something coats/jackets for boys but only 30 something for girls? But my question is this. Are you brave enough to stand up to the trend of only thinking that Boys like star wars and super heroes. Or are you going to believe that girls can like them too. One wonder woman cropped top for Winter does not convince me! Even Asda have got with it a little and produced some very nice  pjs.  I am so tired of my 5yo daughter having to wear boys super hero items that look like boys clothes. After all  you can get plenty for Women! Its very sexist to still believe that girls should like only girly things. Black Widow is a girl. Supergirl is a girl. But even the males superheros are just as important and don t need to be glittered or changed to pink logo s. Just a nice girls fitted shirt  or pjs would be a start.Superheroes clothes that look like they are for girls! My girl needs to dress like she wants! She is a big superhero fan and I know she is not alone!! She doesn t want any more fancy dress dresses  she has supergirl outfit hanging up with her elsa dress. She wants Tee s...Hoodies  Pjs!! You need to start a revolution and show the clothing industry its 2016 and little girls can be nerds too!",

We are staying in a holiday house for two of our best friends birthdays and we didn t want them to find the birthday things we d ordered in our online delivery. So Grant arranged with store to put all the party bits in a separate bag for life which meant I could whisk it away and hide it before my friends caught on. That was amazing enough but on top of that they sent us an extra package with some Finest goodies for their birthday breakfast!   They didn t realise anything and we got to surprise them this morning when they came down :) Thank you so much!!",

Well  we ve been chatting  and we ve decided that it s really annoying. It s lovely  but it s annoying. It was bad enough that I walked into my local store in October to find a Christmas tree in the foyer.  Don t get me wrong  I m no scrooge - I love Christmas  but Santa tills are blummin  annoying.   If you really want to do it  then that is absolutely fine  but can we just keep it to the last few days before Christmas. Or maybe something a little more subtle this year.

Charlie was the delivery chap and unprompted he offered to come back at the end of his delivery rounds and drop an additional chicken. We said that would be great if it was possible.   Low and behold there was a knock on the door at around 21:30 which was Charlie back with an additional chicken (and also a pack of pancetta as I hadn t wanted the substitute available).

Now we ve never had any problems before but one of your staff members was rude and extremely unhelpful to us. My 3 year old son loves Disney s Lion Guard  so whenever we visit and he s been good  we treat him to the little figures that you sell. He was particularly good on Tuesday so we were treating him to 2. He was excited to find that it was the new range of figures and couldn t wait to open them when we got home. We went through self checkout as usual and the figures wouldn t scan. So we contacted a member of staff  who then proceeded to tell us that they weren t on the system. He then wandered off and came back a moment later and said we can t sell you them and then took them from us and walked away! Not trying to resolve the issue as your  Missions  say on your page. My little boy then thought it was his fault and got upset  we then had a tantrum on the way home. All of this because your staff member couldn t be bothered to help. I m more disappointed for him but the lack of interest annoyed me because usually the service is great. Regards  Mark",

  "post_message": "Just a quick email about an issue I have with Tesco Metro at the Old Pond (Cheshunt).  Every day for the last few months shortly after 6pm the Manager at the store blocks off the rear entrance/exit with a large bin that is normally sited outside the building. He does this so that he can start stacking the store trolleys inside the porch just immediately outside the door.  This is particularly annoying  because as a shopper I now have to take a bit of a circuitous route to get in the store through a till that is actually open (either that or open the closed till security gates and set off the alarm as the till at the end of the store where he blocks the entrance are almost always closed).  I\u2019d be very surprised if it doesn\u2019t also break a few Health & Safety regulations  which is why I\u2019ve also reported this matter to Broxbourne Council.  I thought part of the reason for having a store manager is to ensure a good service is provided to the customer.",

  "post_message": "I am writing to suggest that the company really needs to improve its choice of boys school shoes at the Bognor Regis Store.  My eldest boy came out of school  with a piece of Velcro in his hand  it was the top strap of his Tesco school shoes bought for him only 8 weeks ago. Now  I know my boy wears his shoes hard  they don t last on him  that s why I buy cheap ones!  We head over to the BR store straight from school  thinking  I can get a new pair for him to wear tomorrow  so that he doesn t break uniform rules.  Head into the store and there is ONE pair of shoe which is suitable for a school shoe. In sizes 8/9/2. No other sizes available says the customer assistant I spoke to.  There were two pairs of black trainers with decoration  which I and many other don t Class as school shoes. They would be against the uniform rules of the school and are not good for growing feet to be in all day.  So now  due to no choice or fault of his own  he has to go to school tomorrow in his casual trainers and break the rules.   I am continually disgusted by the lack of choice of boys clothes and shoes available in Tesco Stores  but this really takes the mickey!   Regards   Disappointed in Bognor Regis.",

I proceeded to the ready meals aisle where there is a 5ft tall poster advertising this promotion and chose my main  side  dessert and drink from the Finest products on the shelves.  However  when I went through the checkout the promotion was not applied so I went to customer services to query it.  The member of staff at Customer Services duly went off to take a look at the shelves and returned to tell me she d spoken to a manager and Tesco are no longer running the meal deal promotion.  So I queried why the poster is still up if the promotion is unavailable and was somewhat bemused (and irritated) to be told that it was okay to still have the poster up because the POS stand had been removed therefore making it clear that the promotion was over!  Erm  no  sorry  there s a life size poster next to the shelf displaying the Finest Ready Meal products  not to mention the small stickers next to the wine and beer on these shelves.

She cries almost immediately after soiling her nappy as they are so poor at absorption. I ve used other store brand nappies and theee are by far the worst!",

  "post_message": "So Tescos you are adding to my already time consumed busy working mum life. Christmas is now approaching and I want to get my son the Amazon fire kids edition with blue case. I see you currently have a great offer on and I also have clubcard vouchers I would like to use towards the purchase. All sounds simple so far doesn t it?  Well I see you are out of stock on Tesco Direct so I promptly add a stock alert to the item (not that I am now convinced I will get one). I also thought to check my local stores for stock online. Pitsea shows low stock so I race over to find they only have pink fair enough. Whilst I was awaiting for a member of your customer service staff to tell me this I enquired with another colleague there that I could redeem my points off my clubcard. She said no instore they need to be printed. I don t receive vouchers as I only moved house a year ago which I thought after a few calls to clubcard I had amended apparently not. No worries though as they have a machine at pitsea you can print off your vouchers so I just input my old address. When they said they didn t have it I thought ok won t print vouchers now then as it was late and I had a ridiculous early start for work the next day. Checking stock again I saw your Southend store had stock and thinking ahead decided to call the store in advance to be advised yes 2 blue in stock. So once I returned home from my long day in London sorted tea  bath & homework for kids I raced down before electrical desk closed at 8. On arrival I asked customer services where there voucher printing machine was to be told they don t have 1. Anyway I thought worse case scenario I would ask customer services to hold the tablet whilst I raced to pitsea & back. Get a store map to see the inconvenience this would cause me. However I thought go see for myself the tablet. Guess what happens next  you don t have any stock at Southend even when I annoyed the guy on electrical to check again. Now fuming I head to customer services as apparently the guy on electrical couldn t check the stock on his computer as it didn t recognise like probably one of the top 10 kids tablets. Even with a ticket in his hand which with my previous experience working in a supermarket I can only assume it must have a ref no on it to identify stock(just guessing it would be a useful thing to have on it?) so I go to customer services to ask why I was told your store had stock. Well without a blink of her eye she said yes you probably spoke to Cardiff. Well why in hell would I be phoning a store in Essex  to speak to someone in Cardiff? She said yes they look on a computer to see stock levels. So I said so you must have the stock then  she said no the computer isn t always right. I d like to also add at this point no one had apologised to me for all the inconvenience this had caused me. That was the reason so basically tough is what I was told. I then enquired if she could look the item up to see when stock was likely to arrive. Guess what she couldn t do that. I returned home livid  tired and again stressing on where I could possibly get this tablet you have on offer.  Well Tesco I would like to know? Your computer systems don t appear to be very helpful......kind regards Clare Louise Hall-Guy",

This evening she has just helped out an extremely stressed out person with a simple act of kindness. After already trying an asda & tesco for their instant photo service to find out that both were closed after what was already a long day at work  I tried your store in bellshill and once processing the order to find it only accepted card and I only had cash on me I was nearly in tears. When I approached the customer service desk they advised there wasn t a work around but Laura quickly stepped in to offer to use her own personal card. And not only that  she wouldn t even take the money and wanted it to go in the charity box instead.  This girl deserves some recognition for her quick thinking and selfless act. Thank you Laura you have made my day!",

Your solicitor sent paperwork wich I filled im. I waited and waited for a response eventually I got a letter asking for extra time to investigate. I then got quite a patronising letter back saying we wouldn t be getting anything. They even put the cleaning log in to say the floor wasn t slippy. I found that very patronising. It took weeks for my sons head to heal and it can still be tender sometimes. I didn t post anything on social media because I wanted to give Tesco the benefit of the doubt but I m sorry I think your customers needs to know how callus you are. The main point I raised about the shelves hasn t been delt with they are still in the store and still have sharp edges. Just because my son is the only one to be hurt shouldn t mean they are ok.

The lovely young checkout girl with blue hair (sorry I didn t see her name badge) then offered and packed all my shopping for me. She said they re here to help and I have more important things to worry about. She even offered to help me take my shopping to my car. Which I politely refused. I was really taken a back by how friendly your staff were and it really helped make my weekly shop a happy experience rather than a bad stressed one!

  "post_message": "Hello Tesco  hope all is good.  Listen  the past five days I ve been trying to get my hands on some of your lovely caramelised onion hummus - it s literally a taste sensation.  I mean  do you make that stuff out of chickpeas or gold dust?!   However  after searching in three - count  em  THREE - different stores  as well as sending my girlfriend out and about to try and find some. No luck.   I used to literally buy four pots a week  and now I am on an inflicted fasting of my favourite hummus.  If I was a fairytale character  I d be Goldilocks and your hummus would be  just right . If I were a wrestler  I d be The Rock and asking the fans   do you smell what The Rock is cooking?  And they d respond with   something to go with your hummus!     If I was Charlie Bucket given the opportunity to run Willy Wonka s chocolate factory  I d say   No ta  I m holding out hope for Tesco s caramelised onion hummus factory .  You get the picture  I really like it.   Please tell me you haven t stopped production of this fine product! I don t care if somebody accidently dropped shards of glass in the mixing pot or some fella lost his thumb in the production line - I d rather have the hummus and take the risk.   Please let me know  so I can have my mind put at ease  and know that I will once again be enjoying my favourite hummus in the near future.   Many thanks   Stefan Armitage (Clubcard Holder)  PS. Please don t tell me to go and purchase ssome caramelised onion hummus elsewhere  because you ll start to sound like my girlfriend and Sainsburys just don t cut it!",

I find four members of staff chatting at customer service and finally manage to get their attention to open the changing room. All was well I thought. I set about trying on the items when my own skirt slipped off the chair in the fitting room. To my annoyance when I picked it up I noticed it was covered in dust and glitter. The floor was filthy and now so was my skirt!  See the photos  the glitter is hard to see in the photo I admit  but trust me I left the changing room looking like I had been attacked by a broken dust buster and the glitter fairy. I quickly picked up the shopping I needed and went to check out only to be served by the most ignorant assistant ever  she never spoke  smiled  made eye contact  offered to help with the packing  or said please or thank you!  I would provide feedback in the normal way but I can t because the sales assistant ripped the bottom off the receipt. Not impressed Tesco.",

Never mind  I ll post this on my own timeline   alongside the original. At least  that way the people that mean anything to me will know how I feel about your organisation. I realise that you are busy dealing with all the pictures of Halloween masks and are only too happy to respond to people giving you a pat on the back. but I would hope that you could  at least acknowledge one of your customers  that has suffered an injury at the expense of one of your products. Yes  my post was done in a light hearted manner and was not threatening legal action in any way (perhaps I should have)  but that is no reason for it to be ignored. I estimate that between my wife and I  we spend between four and five thousand pounds per year in your stores. If you wish us to ship off to another supermarket  just say the word  there are no shortages these days. I wasn t after compensation  all I wanted was an acknowledgement and some empathy from your organisation to one of your loyal customers. If that is beyond you  I know what I need to do in the future.",

Sad I know! \u00a32.50 on a soup is a lot of money when you compare the price of the average can of Heinz tinned soup. So I expect the best  especially as it is from your  Finest  range. When I picked up my soup during my weekly shop I thought you might have made a dodgy batch given that I noticed the consistency of the soup was very  very watery? I came home today popped it in the microwave  still worried about how runny it was  given that I can normally stand a spoon in it? And then I noticed those two dreaded words  New Recipe ! Which translates to  a perfectly good product that has been watered down to cut costs for Tesco and to boost profits too . How can you still charge \u00a32.50 when you have watered down  what was a very delicious soup! \ud83d\ude1e I note that it doesn t say  New and Improved Recipe  which is good as it would be a lie!",

  "post_message": "Hi Tesco. I have always been a big fan but today your customer service has let you down so much that I want the world to know how appalled I am. My daughter (4 years old) had set her heart on a pair of your school shoes so I bought them for her to start the new term with. She was so happy! And so was I at \u00a313.00 that was a big saving on school shoes :) they ticked all the boxes and most importantly were labelled scuff resistant. So after her first day of wearing them to school yesterday her heart was broken that they were  ruined  with a big scuff on them. I was not impressed but reassured her that we would get her another pair. I never for a moment doubted that there would be a problem. After speaking to Lauren at your customer service desk at Swansea she advised us she would need to speak to a manager as we did not have a receipt. Understandable but obvious the shoes had only been worn once and still looked brand new despite the scuff! Lauren s manager Paul then approached us to say they could not be replaced or damaged as it was not a fault with the shoe it was a scuff and these things happen. We agreed that yes you can expect shoes to scuff on a 4 year old however these were advertised as scuff resistant and had been worn once!!!! Paul was very condescending and would not listen to a word that me or my husband were saying refusing to exchange the shoes. I argued that Tesco pride themselves on school uniform lasting and false advertising and he reluctantly and rudely said go and exchange them then but they will still scuff! We picked a replacement pair and Paul had disappeared from sight. Lauren replaced the product for us and as she was doing so another of her colleagues Lisa leant over to us and said  I m not being funny but they will do exactly the same  again very rudely. If we had our receipt we would have had a full refund and never bought school shoes from you again. As it stands we exchanged our shoes but are not holding out hopes as to how long they will last. Absolutely shocking that you are advertising them as scuff resistant school shoes however they are obviously not fit for purpose. I will be very interested to see how many people comment with how their Tesco shoes for school have lasted their children. Your motto is every penny counts and it certainly does \u00a313 for school shoes that lasted one day! Leaving us out of pocket and with the extra hassle of an upset 4 year old and a trip back to Tesco. With a history in customer service I am aware of exactly how a customer should be treated and can t believe just how appallingly we were treated by a manager at Tesco! Very disappointed Tesco I shall be shopping elsewhere from today onwards.",

The offer ended last night and when I ordered the bottles they stated the reduction would only be on deliveries by 31 Oct. I phoned this morning to rearrange my delivery which was emailed at the correct new price. So I called them with a view to cancelling my order even though it was our own fault the dele hadn t been received but before I even got to that statement they offered to honour the previous price. The only thing was I had to enter the evoucher reduction off my bill. No great hardship as they hadn t taken the money yet. Tesco you were amazing and without having to ask.",

  "post_message": "Regarding order number (message me for it)  I would like to make a serious complaint.  On Sunday I tried to make an online order to by a tv. Catalogue Number: 714-6584  I needed to order it with a note to the courier to call me 15 mins before they will arrive so i can leave my office and go home to greet them. So I called up on Sunday to see if this was possible.  On the phone  the girl told me that:  1. If I order express next day delivery  in the morning I would receive an email from a courier giving me an hour\u2019s window in which I could go home and sit and wait for the tv. She checked on the catalogue number that this would be ok for this product and if it would get delivered by the courier that gives this option. 2. She could set up an account for me then and there and take my payment over the phone.  So I did the above.  I did not receive any email to confirm my account  or the invoice  or the order. This got me worried so the following morning (Monday) I called you.  The man on the phone said it was strange  confirmed my email  and just told me to sit and wait for the email invoice to come. he told me he could not resend the confirmation or invoice (which I think is weird). This was not a helpful conversation.  Later that day I called again as nothing arrived.  In this conversation I was told.  1. I should never have been told that my tv will arrive on Monday  as that is not an option - but why? (although it was an option online) 2. My email address is wrong - you forgot to include the \u2019s\u2019 on amandameadows363@gmail.com. which is absolutely silly as this was confirmed in the previous phone call  AND the first phone call- your customer service advisors are not being accurate enough. 3. No one has the ability to change it (why????) and I cannot wait online for their colleague to do it - they needed to log a ticket elsewhere (which has not been done as I still have had no email) 4. The girl I spoke to was leaving and would ask her colleague to call me within 7-9pm that evening  every 30 mins until I pick up   and everything will be rectified.  I received no call.  to my knowledge i bought and paid for a tv  (a huge purchase for me)   I have no idea where it is  it should have arrived  I have no email correspondence from you  and all i am doing is wasting my money and time calling you  no one can help me or even return my calls. Do you expect me to keep calling you?  Where is my tv  when is it coming and does Tesco even care about me or my order or want me as a future customer?  To my knowledge it\u2019s it could be sitting on my doorstep waiting to be stolen.  Amanda -message me for phone number",

I visited the Cleckheaton Tesco petrol pumps last night at around 8pmish after going to my usual filling station and seeing it was closed. I was trying to fill my car and realised it was a pay at pump filling point  I must confess I ve never used one before and the gent that was working with the lady came to help and show me how.  For one reason or another after 4 attempts the pump did not want to read my card. They advised me I can t pay cash as that side of it had been turned off. Then the lovely lady  offered to pay on her card amd fill my car while I ran across the car park to draw the cash out to give to her.  She was so helpful and I can t express my thanks enough. I only wish I caught her name. Please can you pass on my thanks and ensure that she is recognised at the store for her fantastic customer care.  Mrs Emma Harrison (Now a Tesco shopper)",

You put it in the ground UNDER your tombstone. You then put like your  epitaph or whatever ON the tombstone. This is really basic stuff guys  and you blew it. (Ok  MAYBE you might have an engraving of a skull on your  stone  but NEVER EVER ACTUAL HUMAN BONES. C mon).  Look  I know I m being pedantic  but OH MY GOD WHO IN YOUR MARKETING IS IN CHARGE OF THIS STUFF?  THREE - THAT SHAPE IS NOT A TOMBSTONE  IT IS A COFFIN. The long hexagon shape is not a shape that people use for their tombstones. It s a coffin and you know it. What kind of stunt are you trying to pull with these blatant lies?  Also  that is far too much packaging for just two gingerbread biscuits. You could fit loads in there.  Thank you.",

  "post_message": "Hi can you help me please. I can not find your free from fresh selection in your Ricoh arena store.i can only find your dairy free selection of deserts cheese and youghurts etc but no free from pizzas pies breaded meat etc. Can you please tell me if you actually have a fresh free from section. If not why not? It is very odd marks and spencer does a couple of doors away.also your freezer section is pretty limited and generally just processed food.  Also why don t you have your own brand of lactose free milk or youghurts yet you have your own brand in the alternatives like soya and almonds and there are loads of choice anyway. in fed up of going to the shop for milk and your out of stock of the lactose free milk.i can not have the almternatives-you tend to only put out one box of lactose free milk.im sure people do that same as me and buy 4 or 5 at the same time but these leaves the shelf empty for other customers. please help me on these issues. Thanks",

  "post_message": "Tesco advert on TV states 3 for 2 on ALL toys! I went to the large Tesco at lakeside to my disappointment there were hardly no toys except books  silly games  odd dolls & figures  nothing like what s advertised on tv. So I then went on line thinking I could place a large order as it was such a good offer on all toys apparently! Apparently not! I put 12 items in my trolly coming to over \u00a3300  when I went to checkout it said saving of \u00a339! So I removed 9 items & left 3  it showed no discount. I then put 3 items in the basket marked 3 for 2! The discount applied  so clearly it s false advertising as the promotion is not on ALL toys & only on selected toys. I processed my order & recieved my confirmation email saying my order is being processed. I then recieved another email saying problem with my order  refund of \u00a320.05 is being processed! No reason why. So the most expensive item can not be processed  that s convenient. I do not want this order as there is no promotion that in benefitting from. So not only is Tesco advertising falsely  but you don t benefit from any item you do buy as there s problems with the order! Tesco I m very disappointed & feel ripped off by yourselves. I want my order cancelled  I will take my custom elsewhere & spend my money where I am not being ripped off  especially leading up to the festive season.",

  "post_message": "Went to Tesco for half a cucumber - empty boxes where the portions should be  full boxes and boxes of whole ones. Asked if someone could cut one in half for me and they looked at me as if I were mad - told me no. Went to customer services to ask why you couldn t do what other supermarkets do and they looked at me blankly and said  Is that what produce said? . Honestly if you want to use a slogan like  every little helps  then do a very little and cut a cucumber in half. I knew there was a reason I can t be bothered to shop with you any more - Monday evening and half the fresh produce was empty - I won t make the mistake of bothering to use Tesco again - I ll just carry on to a supermarket that smiles and says  Half a cucumber - of course madam ",
