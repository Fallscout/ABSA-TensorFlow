Could you please tell me why tescos has made this decision? I get very few points from tesco and this is the only way I manage to boost my points every year to take part in your online clubcard boosts. I am aware you are meant to be running some new points promotions in store  but have yet to see any sign of this and as I am a single person shopping for just me  think it s unlikely to get me any great amount of points  and certainly not the ¬£50 a year I have been getting through topcashback. Unfortunately my date for exchange is in December  so with you withdrawing at such short notice  I won t be able to use this method again üòî At this rate there seems very little point in giving tesco my business at all anymore as without the clubcard points there really is no benefit to shopping there when I have all the major 5 retailers locally and lidl  with Aldi also arriving in the next few mths.  We are getting in touch to let you know about changes to payout options available. Tesco has recently made some alterations to its Tesco Clubcard scheme and as a consequence from the 31st July 2016  Tesco Clubcard points will no longer be available as a payout method. While we realise this may be frustrating for members  TopCashback tried to do everything it possibly could to keep Tesco Clubcard as a payout method on site.   Our records show that you have either previously used Tesco Clubcard as a payout method or have registered your Tesco Clubcard to your account so if you would like to take advantage of the Tesco Clubcard payout method one last time you have until the 31st July to do so.   We have spoken with members who have previously used Tesco Clubcard as a payout method and a third told us they exchanged cashback for Tesco Clubcard points to then transfer them into airmiles points (i.e. Avios). Three in 10 swapped cashback into points for restaurants vouchers and a fifth paid for family days out.					2016-05-31T22:47:31+0000	1464734851	2016-06-01 00:47:31	0	13	0	0	13	13	4	9	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Everything comes in nice segregated bags  the delivery guy was very helpful  easy peasy  or so you would have thought......  On our first delivery after the helpful delivery man rather enthusiastically told us everything we had ordered had been in stock. We later discovered that the Mrs leg shaver blades were missing but we had been charged for them! Now I m not on too moan so we gave the guys a call on the receipt and had the amount refunded (¬£10.50) happy days.   And then we get to today s misfortune......  After reordering the Mrs leg shaver blades (that are very much needed) they arrived safe and sound in there very own impenetrable thief safe mag box! Thanks tesco! üò†  I will take great enjoyment opening this with a HAMMER.

Always dry and hard past few days I have bought them and my cats wouldn t even touch them  it s more annoying because Tesco is pretty much the only place in my area that sells them. I do say to the staff they quality has dropped but nothing has being done.

Bought the noodles  rice etc and was looking forward to a fresh stir fry until I opened the chicken fillets. The smell was dreadful even though package dated 4th June. Again Tesco has let me down.

Had I not noticed and given these to my daughter we could have ended up with a hospital stay. I can t understand the logic of introducing one of the top allergens into a free from product that has previously been fine without it but more importantly I feel this change should be made clearer as it could have a real effect on people s  health.

After my complaint the smoking stopped however the past 4 times I ve been staff have been smoking in and around the trolley shelters.  A netto has opened down the road. I think I ll be taking my custom there instead of taking my children to breathe in second hand smoke.					2016-05-31T15:44:49+0000	1464709489	2016-05-31 17:44:49	0	2	0	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m just writing this to ask you to acknowledge the kindness and support The manager and staff of your cafe in the Bicester store showed today whilst my son  who has suspected autism (yet to be diagnosed)  had a meltdown. I believe the managers name is Robbie.  Most times when this happens all we get is stares and judgements from passers by. Robbie provided us with somewhere quiet to take my son to so he could calm down when I was struggling to do so in such a busy place.   So thank you very much Bicester cafe staff for helping and most importantly not judging my son. I can t tell you how amazing this is and I appreciate your kindness so very much!					2016-05-31T14:47:43+0000	1464706063	2016-05-31 16:47:43	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were her penultimate delivery of the day  and it was late in the evening. She still had a smile on her face despite the long shift  and not being able to park close to our house. She noticed the stair gates and baby monitor and proceeded to help me with the shopping into the kitchen  incredibly quietly so as not to wake my daughter.  I m afraid I didn t catch her name  but I didn t want this level of customer service to go unnoticed. We are in Coventry.   We were so impressed! Well done  Tesco!					2016-05-31T14:41:46+0000	1464705706	2016-05-31 16:41:46	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was about to load my shopping onto the checkout this afternoon when my son began to cry hysterically . Michelle quickly came over and kindly offered to unload my shopping from my trolley onto the conveyor. She then continued to pack my shopping into bags and accompany me to my car all so I could see to my baby. She was fantastic and really helped me out. Superb customer service and a credit to your team. I really hope she gets the recognition she deserves from this post.

Myself and my partner do not have a large budget for food shopping and so choose to shop with Tesco as you have the best value for money. According to your website  you also ensure that your packers provide the longest life available on foods.  The order we placed was delivered at 10pm on Thursday 26th May. 2 items had expired by Saturday  5 by Sunday  10 by Monday and 11 by today. The total for this food works out to be ¬£29.14. It doesn t sound like a lot but we have now had to go elsewhere to replace this wasted food (who on earth could eat 1kg of mince  950g of chicken and 16 sausages in 3 days?). These totals only relate to the expiry dates provided on your products  but many of these had already gone off prior to this date.  We do not drive  so cannot return this food to your store for a refund. As such  what would you suggest we do? We are completely unsatisfied with the quality and life of the food we have received and expect to hear from you soon.  Regards Rebecca Davis					2016-05-31T13:56:57+0000	1464703017	2016-05-31 15:56:57	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday (30 May 2016 around 6pm) I went to one of your stores  the Tesco in Paul Street Shopping Centre-Lavits Quay (Cork)  where I had problems with my identity documents because the cashier and the manager of the store didn t recognise my Italian ID card and instead insisted on seeing my passport. I m a European citizen and my documents are valid in the whole of Europe and I have never had problem. Also  it is unacceptable that the company policy sometimes accepts documents such as my driving licence and sometimes not. So  I think I will change the supermarket I go to from now on.					2016-05-31T09:30:25+0000	1464687025	2016-05-31 11:30:25	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As of Easter 2017  Tesco will no longer sell any Easter eggs that use the word  Easter  on the packaging.  It has come to our attention that this is found to be offensive by members of certain faiths.  Rather than antagonise any religious group  we will refrain from selling them products.   This is a Christian country.  If the above is true  has Tesco not considered that millions of people in this  our country  will be highly offended?  What will be next?  Tesco refusing to sell any products that use the word  Christmas  on the packaging?					2016-05-31T06:30:03+0000	1464676203	2016-05-31 08:30:03	1	8	1	1	10	8	3	5	8	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Go online to find no clubcard points has been refunded so I ring your customer service line last week gave details of my order to be told he would send a voucher for the cost of the iron  (¬£18) though a email. I ve waited a week and still nothing  I rang back up 2 days ago for the lady to say she would sort the problem out and resend it.... and guess what still nothing? !  I know my emails are fine as I m still receiving emails from yourselfs from the baby group I m in.  I think waiting over 2 weeks is disgusting and feel like I m getting fobbed off.

The way to do this is catch them like fish then impound them in cold high pressure containers  separate the water from the methane  sell the methane for slow burning and give the water to whoever needs it but only  Only  for growing plants such as in Africa  not for human but all life benefit.

This is a Tesco Custard that we where going to give to our 2.5 year old. We purchased it this week and was only opened today.  What scares me is if we gave it to our 5 year old she would have  opened she might have thought is was a flavouring and tried it.

However on selecting the bunches I noticed there weren t any flower bags so I went to customer services for help.  At the desk I was met by 2 ladies who looked like they didn t really want to be there. No smile. No  can I help you?   I explained I wanted a bag for the flowers so they didn t drip on me whilst I picked up a few more things. I was told quite nonchalantly that they didn t have any bags. No sorry for no flower bags. They just looked at me like it was my fault.  I explained again. One of the ladies briefly looked up at me and suggested  a tissue?  Then the other lady had the bright idea to actually look for a bag at the desk. She found one. I walked away thinking for such a giant in our food industry your customer service skills are pretty small.   I then went to tk max in Maidstone where my faith in customer service was restored. They on 2 occasions have gone above and beyond to make me a  happy customer. I will of course be congratulating them.					2016-05-30T20:59:32+0000	1464641972	2016-05-30 22:59:32	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Put it on to boil as usual and it suddenly burst into flames  very nearly burning my husbands hand in the process. We have had this less than six months. We also have small children in the house and the entire downstairs filled with acrid smoke. Phoned customer services who just said bring it back with receipt but didn t appear overly concerned at all.

I feel this is relevant to your  new recipe  fish cakes! I was horrified when I cut into one to see it now resembles cod roe. It has a hideous consistency and and horrible after taste. I m guessing the new recipe was in aid of saving money? Ironically you probably won t save money as people like myself will now not buy them! I loved them as they were with pieces of real fish in them.

Eagerly awaiting the yumminess...   However... Whilst baking they didn t smell particularly good  but on removing from the oven they smelt like vomit.  We left them to cool  just in case  but when we tried them they actually tasted disgusting... As they smelt.. Like vomit...  Very disappointed with this product.  I have only used half of the dough  so will be returning the remainder and the 2 baked cookies to my local store tomorrow...  Not a happy customer this evening :-(					2016-05-30T18:17:07+0000	1464632227	2016-05-30 20:17:07	0	8	0	0	8	8	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Anyway even more exciting for me was that some had gone down to 48p yay  so me being the biggest strawberry fan ever bought 6 packets yes 6 which cost even less than just one packet of posh looking strawberries. I bought  2 merange probably spelt that wrong lol  and some whipping cream. Added a spoonful coco powder to the cream and 2 spoons of icing sugar gave it good whip up grated chocolate on top  and the results now have me on the sofa in a strawberry coma.

I love the chicken in a bag so decided to give it a go.  I had this delivered yesterday and I cooked it today. The packet says 45 mins for medium so I did just that. I tried to carve the joint after resting it and I just couldn t!  The whole joint was laced with fat. My husband managed to get some meat off so our dinner wasn t entirely ruined but it had virtually no taste! It claims to feed 6 but it fed two adults and a child as the middle was inedible. It was a solid lump of fat.  Not impressed at all!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13332747_10153501942797791_5969884696249882789_n.jpg?oh=5731692efc8f928cedb11bef113413eb&oe=590D0E17	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13332747_10153501942797791_5969884696249882789_n.jpg?oh=520e6988e20aeeda90f2e8421b76acd4&oe=5916671A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153501942797791&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-30T17:24:39+0000	1464629079	2016-05-30 19:24:39	0	10	0	0	10	10	4	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I had my online shop delivered with the majority of the fridge produce within a day or 2 of being out of date. The delivery man was very apologetic and asked if I wanted to check my order but with the amount delivered it wasn t possible until putting it away. This is the second time that I have had a weekend online shop with a lot of BB or use by dates of less than 3 days.					2016-05-30T17:22:56+0000	1464628976	2016-05-30 19:22:56	0	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	3	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

This has happened on numerous occasions which I have previously just let slide however yet again today I get home to find a humongous piece of ginger. It s pretty frustrating when I will have paid approx ¬£10 extra over my past few shops due to this happening.

And what better way to start the day than with a lovely healthy breakfast. So here I am  at 8 in the morning with my porridge oats and golden syrup when I had the wonderful idea  why not add a potassium filled healthy addition to my thick and oaty delight. So I peal my banana (bottom first so I didn t get the stringy bits) and to my horror I discover what looks like the Devil s own finger. This red demon wrapped in a yellow skin was covered tip to nib in what can only be described as red veins. The fruit looked like it had been on bloody steroids!!! Obviously I didn t devour the banana and luckily I managed to enjoy my porridge with berries instead (which were most defiantly not covered in horrid growths). I was disappointed with the contents of my banana and hope that the next time I buy one from Tescos super market  I don t peel back Satan and unleash dooms day. Please no more manky bananas... I might stick to toast from now on.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13321840_1612786049011960_7814462883387614884_n.jpg?oh=fcccd84eb508fe699ec1849dfc470c67&oe=591426B7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13321840_1612786049011960_7814462883387614884_n.jpg?oh=1dd54b71e17f5f23c466c03ce707a107&oe=58DAA2A2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1612786049011960&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-30T16:27:27+0000	1464625647	2016-05-30 18:27:27	5	8	7	1	16	8	2	6	4	0	5	0	0	1	0	1	0

The balloons were supposed to be used as part of a fundraising event yesterday evening for Greyhound Gap. The balloons arrived on time and I took them along to the event. Games time arrived and the balloons were blown up and attached to the attendees at the event. The idea was that they were popped by one person crushing them against another. Unfortunately the balloons are apparently made of Kevlar and they proved almost indestructible! While this is fantastic if you are using them to decorate a party or give to a child  it s terribly disappointing for a group of adults trying to raise money whilst amusing themselves in a childish way! Perhaps a value section of balloons is needed for just this type of thing? I can provide video evidence of the complete failure of the balloons to poo of you would find this useful?					2016-05-30T16:15:28+0000	1464624928	2016-05-30 18:15:28	1	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

My daughter got one on Saturday as a present from her Nana  which she was playing with yesterday and the head fell off (the one on the left  Kim). So we got her another one today (the one on the right  Lulu)  which lasted the whole of 2 minutes from your Lincoln store  to which my daughter passed me it on the way home and said  mummy the head isn t on properly . To my disappointment the head was hanging off and fell off in my hand. She has a third one which is currently still in tact  but I am not convinced that will last very long  as the heads on these mermaids are put on the bodies separately and are clearly not safe for children to play with! My daughter was not being overly rough with these toys  nor was she sat there trying to twist or pull the heads. She was simply playing with them as they are advertised to be played with  and how dissapointed she is that a second mermaid has broken!  These are an accident waiting to happen and as a regular customer I would hate to hear that a mermaid had been purchased from you!!  It reflects badly on your stores  and I will certainly be letting  Magiki  know about this too! At a price of ¬£2.50 for one I would expect it to be better made and more durable too!!   Parents please be cautious on giving these to your children to play with no matter what age  especially if they have younger siblings who could come across a broken one!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13344789_10156851773155251_6508928548191248509_n.jpg?oh=c2383af25faac5382515b5eae1979d76&oe=591A9C7E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q83/p720x720/13344789_10156851773155251_6508928548191248509_n.jpg?oh=94df721ca7b5fde1ca543592e5488129&oe=59169333	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156851773155251&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-30T15:37:30+0000	1464622650	2016-05-30 17:37:30	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Same brand as I always buy. So imagine my surprise when I peel back the tape sealing the box and find only 5 packs of wipes instead of 6. I phoned  and got through to Customer Services  but not the Leyland store  who advised me I needed to take the box with the 5 packets in back to the store.....not really an option when I had opened it because I needed them!! Maybe the Leyland store got a faulty batch...maybe you need to go shake some boxes to make sure they are full.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13321940_10156930050760640_1241067206979659479_n.jpg?oh=edddcd693847c23a27b28c89bdc6017b&oe=591FF9EC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13321940_10156930050760640_1241067206979659479_n.jpg?oh=ab4abf1eccb556e4e873c0fec7111072&oe=58D9E3E1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156930050760640&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-30T14:50:42+0000	1464619842	2016-05-30 16:50:42	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I left comments saying Thank You for changing the lid  and asking if they had changed it recently because it didn t have the same  oomf  as it normally did.  He phoned me back  even before I d received the confirmatory e-mail  and said that he d looked into it  and the supplier had changed on 22 Mar and would pass my comments up the chain.  Then after I d had a whinge about the new veg range  he said he d send me a ¬£10 e-voucher to compensate as a  good will  gesture.  Which is nice.  Again  hank you very much.  And yes  I really do need to get out  more  but I ve got a broken hip and don t really have much else to do.  Would you like  me to be a  taster  for the company?

Was trying to make a purchase and as only one member of staff on the tills We tried to use the self service till. My husband scanned the purchase and the machine asked for and took our cash a ¬£10 note it kept asking for payment although the machine had swallowed the ¬£10. The man on the checkout eventually came and said the machine says you owe ¬£1.98 we said we had put in cash which the machine had taken and he said the machine says you owe ¬£1.98 his inference was that we were not telling the truth. By this time there was a large queue both at his till and behind us it was most embarassing. I asked why he was on his own and he rang for the manager. A tall man in a suit eventually came some minutes later. I asked why there were not more staff since it was busy and he replied it was empty a few minutes ago. He checked the machine and agreed we had deposited ¬£10 but he could not get the machine to issue our change either. Eventually I asked for our ¬£10 back so I could make my purchase elsewhere. At no time did we recieve an apoligy for our treatment and I again emphasise that we were left feeling we were in the wrong and that we had not paid for our purchase. The situation would not have arisen if Tesco did not rely on machines instead of actual staff. I fear I will not be visiting this store again  I await your reply with interest					2016-05-30T12:06:07+0000	1464609967	2016-05-30 14:06:07	2	6	2	0	8	6	2	4	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

No longer allowed to sit on the bike while filling up the tank and having to remove helmets when paying?  I and a few friends have now been refused pump authorisation until we get off the bikes and then spoken to like dirt regarding fueling and removing helmets from your employee taking payment.  I for one will be avoiding Tesco petrol stations and will be passing the message along to local bike groups and friends.					2016-05-30T10:53:08+0000	1464605588	2016-05-30 12:53:08	2	20	3	0	23	18	10	8	10	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

Just spotted Sainsbury selling not only nut but gluten free celebration cakes and the delicious cocoa libre nut  dairy wheat and gluten free chocolate . Nice to see a supermarket finally recognising nut free can sit alongside the rest of the free from range and be advertised as well . It would be good for Tesco to be stocking more nut free too especially in light of your diabolical   also  may contains nuts   statement was added to your products . Like the nut is an afterthought even though it can kill . Your free from range has nothing stated as nut free the last time I looked .					2016-05-30T08:56:13+0000	1464598573	2016-05-30 10:56:13	36	32	36	3	71	32	13	19	74	0	36	0	0	0	0	0	0

I checked the working hours of the three nearest stores and they were all WRONG! How come?! Ever update the info?  Hurst Street was closed all day! The one inside New Street station was closed after 9pm and the Caxton Gate one was closed too!!! Bank holiday or not just fix the times! I think your stores close whenever they want to.  I have been using only and exclusively your chain for quite a long time and I am super tired of your disorganization!					2016-05-30T01:29:49+0000	1464571789	2016-05-30 03:29:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We live in the town  and have just arrived back after a nine hour  500-mile trip from visiting family. We stopped off to see if the car wash was open as our windshield is caked in bugs from the motorway. The attendant looked at my husband blankly  laughed in his face and said  8pm . No explanation. He was patronising  sarcastic and unfriendly. He wasn t wearing his name badge but he has glasses and salt and pepper hair. Please send him on a customer service course; he cannot be a happy bloke.					2016-05-29T22:21:49+0000	1464560509	2016-05-30 00:21:49	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I came in with a basket to top up on barbeque food that i didn t order with my home delivery. When at the checkout  i noticed the store had a gazebo on display upstairs which reminded me i needed to get one. The checkout lady was lovely and stored my shopping for me to go for a look at the gazebo. While upstairs  a lovely lassie (with blonde hair) offered me help  which i gladly accepted. She helped me find the gazebos and all the barbeque tools i also needed!!! She started to carry the gazebo to the checkout  when the dotcom Manager (Ross i believe) came to aide her. He helped me the rest of the way  right through the till and into my car. I can only comment on these members of staff  but if all Tesco staff are like these  then you are a very lucky company  and we are very lucky customers :) Way above and beyond any job description! Thanks guys  you are the best and deserve recognition. xxx					2016-05-29T20:14:01+0000	1464552841	2016-05-29 22:14:01	8	2	8	0	10	2	1	1	1	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

Anyway after a lovely Sunday roast I watch the children devour their packet of doughnuts whilst declining the offer of one out of their packet as they are  too fattening  for mummy who is doing so well with boring salad daily  only to open my  secret packet  once they are all settled in bed and come across this... No jam!! I mean come on!! I even opened them all to be sure!! Now the other half is on his way to the local Tesco for a bar of dairy milk for my trauma and hopefully there is chocolate in the packet so thank you Tesco for ruining my secret eating!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13312795_10206415075759069_8881922931893121044_n.jpg?oh=df72284446c7bd3cf24bfa33a3be0886&oe=59157DFB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13312795_10206415075759069_8881922931893121044_n.jpg?oh=d84d0efcdca9aded4ccafdecc953fec1&oe=590B0FF6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206415075759069&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-29T18:46:47+0000	1464547607	2016-05-29 20:46:47	7	14	10	0	24	14	3	11	7	0	7	1	0	2	0	0	0

They were in the bank holiday offers and I boosted my vouchers. A few hours later  I received an email to tell me that the mattress was out of stock  even though there was no mention on the website that it was out of stock. I called up explaining that I still would like a mattress and to use my vouchers and to take advantage of the bank holiday offers. They emailed me a gift card code to use when I reordered. It took about 24 hours to come through. So once it came through I called up to place another order. They told me that the mattress that I ordered this time was in stock. I was happy until I received an email saying that it was out of stock. The customer service number is now closed so if I call tomorrow to get another gift card code  by the time I get the email  the bank holiday offers would have ended and I would have to pay full price again. I am very upset and angry  not at the staff on the phone  as they were fine  but it s the system and the website. I would have thought that the staff on the phone would have more of an insight into stock levels.  I am desperate now Tesco. What do you suggest I do next?					2016-05-29T18:31:17+0000	1464546677	2016-05-29 20:31:17	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only is it making the whole of the local precinct look scrappy and uninviting but as the water has got to it it is starting to look dangerous.  Im sure Tescos has the ability to fix this over night  and yet fellow residents brought this to your attention on the 8th of May and despite your assurances that something would be done  nothing at all has changed.  It has looked this scrappy and nasty for a while and really enough is enough.  You will find that that other local stores in the parade (including a new Sainsburys of a similar size to your Tesco store) are managing to put their best foot forward - so why is Tescos letting down a small community in such a way?  What does it take for a large multi national to deal with such a situation properly.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13310384_282183195458833_3333995840774127928_n.jpg?oh=5129d2d49ea595c59e51e89e4b386654&oe=5908CD86	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13310384_282183195458833_3333995840774127928_n.jpg?oh=ace952efea1f53a8f7056eae4ea449b7&oe=59183E47	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=282183195458833&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-29T18:29:25+0000	1464546565	2016-05-29 20:29:25	0	11	0	0	11	11	2	9	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My local is in Ballinrobe  Co Mayo Ireland.  People have traditionally pulled up outside the store in the large  set down  area  when free  and popped in for their shopping. Not so today.... As I pulled up and let my partner out  she was immediately approached by the  Law of the Land .... The Ban Garda then went on  to take my details as she threatened me with a ticket.....twice..... When I approached  Graham  the manager of the store  his attitude towards me and the subject was completely dismissive.  Even to the point of  telling me to shop elsewhere....  How disgusting this treatment is..... I will definitely be writing to both the regional manager   HR and also to Mandate Trade Union who I am sure will be interested..... Bad show Tesco.... could you not just have placed a person outside to inform your customers of your changing policy in relation to customer parking?..... BTW  your manager needs training....	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13307365_10209491341823486_5628516405412851968_n.jpg?oh=08194d2707e1ea7aa4029f9bb9cbc96f&oe=59112CE5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13307365_10209491341823486_5628516405412851968_n.jpg?oh=9898060da81977bc4c10a5b95b89dd76&oe=590D1003	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209491341823486&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-29T17:17:16+0000	1464542236	2016-05-29 19:17:16	4	3	4	0	7	3	3	0	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Hawaii Garden Furniture Set  8 piece ¬£75.99  Then the item went out of stock when the Tesco clubcard boost started.   Two/three weeks later and Tesco relisted the item at ¬£100.00 and there is plenty of stock now.   When I first saw the Hawaii Garden Furniture Set  8 piece Tesco had it was on offer at ¬£75.00 and they also had a code for ¬£10 off which was TDX-HTNH which only works with orders over ¬£50.   Now the code is expired and I have to pay more why?  Can you honour the previous price of ¬£65.99?  Why should I have to pay extra now for the same product? And there is now a delivery charge of ¬£7.95 now also which make the same item ¬£35.99 more than your previous offer.....  Very dissatisfied with Tesco s policy. Not so much #everylittlehelps but more  more  more.....   Will definitely never set foot in a Tesco store ever again  liars.					2016-05-29T16:20:12+0000	1464538812	2016-05-29 18:20:12	1	4	3	0	7	4	4	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0

Most of the strawberries looked bruised and sweaty. Blueberries where all mushed and mouldy. Pre-prepared carrots looked white and dried out.  By the time I got to the lettuce area I was totally disappointed! There was ready prepared ice burg lettuce cut up with the date of 1st June on them (3/4 days date on them) and they was all mouldy  pink and mushy.   I am Tesco customer  I have been for many years. This is not the first time I have seen this in your stores  but I took a moment to take a picture and make you aware. As now I am fed up of driving to your store and there is nothing suitable that I like to eat due to rotting?  Why did you not tell a member of staff I hear you say! No Tesco staff was available as no one was about. It looked like your store was running on short staff on a busy sunny day? And I didn t have time to look round for your staff in other areas as I had a BBQ to prepare for a family visit.   How is this happening to the food? Bad storage by yourselves? Bad suppliers bagging up old food? What ever it is  it s not good enough for your customers and not good for you!.. There are fresh competition out there! Also the member of staff that thought this was suitable to put out to be purchased needs training on what fresh produce is?  Hope you look into this and get this sorted.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13325656_10208871833820495_82576492342154005_n.jpg?oh=5e758e41938292db9e4e4844e317b9f7&oe=5919857D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13325656_10208871833820495_82576492342154005_n.jpg?oh=0ce77bfe712fadf8cacea2971bdae6c5&oe=58D98282	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208871833820495&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-29T15:56:49+0000	1464537409	2016-05-29 17:56:49	16	1	19	1	21	1	1	0	0	0	16	0	1	0	0	2	0

It will cost over ¬£50 pounds in dental repairs to get it fixed  so I sent another three emails same automated reply and nothing. I did expect a better response from one of the biggest supermarkets but big means  we don t give a care or sure looks like that...  I purchased a chicken and ricotta in December and it was then put in the freezer . We had it for dinner today 6/2/2016 bought at Your Withernsea branch. I have enclosed a picture of what looks like an aluminium nail embedded in the chicken and the packaging. I thought it was a bone after biting on it I found out it was a nail and thank god I didn t swallow it. It s broken park of my tooth having bitten on it. Why this nail should have ended up in your product is beyond me and I this could have been very serious if I had swallowed it. I can t wait for your response on why and how this nail ended up in my mouth.

Regular  super and super plus are still available so could you make some space on the shelf (where there always used to be some) for the lite version too? Thanks.					2016-05-29T13:25:03+0000	1464528303	2016-05-29 15:25:03	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But it expired the day after I received it  so can t use them.  Really disappointed as this was one of the reasons I swapped from asda to you  because of your loyalty rewards.  Is there anything you can do to correct this?  So I can benefit from my loyalty?  X					2016-05-29T13:22:12+0000	1464528132	2016-05-29 15:22:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This has happened a few times - we re not removing them!!! Unfortunately we didn t realise until the shop had been delivered. This is very frustrating as we live in a remote part of the Highlands and rely on your food deliveries. Our nearest store is an hours drive away. We have two very hungry cats now!! Has anyone else complained of this? We use your website and phone apps to update our shop.

I am unable to log on to my club card account to double up vouchers. I went in to the store and they said they needed the paper copies of my vouchers in order to double up in store (I tend to do it all online so don t keep them) so called the club card helpline and they said I just needed to take my c/card to store and they could do it all without the paper coupons.  Called my local store to check and they said absolutely not but that the people on the phone could double up and email me a code.. both said the other was wrong and now I am a bit confused.  Without the paper copies and being able to log in online is there any form of customer service that could access my account and do it for me so I could use the vouchers in store today?   Thanks :)					2016-05-29T11:03:59+0000	1464519839	2016-05-29 13:03:59	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was shovelling them in just after I d opened them  when I noticed that one end of the large pack was covered in mould (we purchased them from your Redruth store only yesterday). Oh  and something else that s probably worth mentioning is that he also found inside.....a DEAD BEE!!!!!!!!! üêùüò±üò∑  If you d kindly message me  that would be smashing.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13312698_10153868404289064_4333087836231597970_n.jpg?oh=f94d2e42d29f7371478d99af89431905&oe=58DBA0B6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13312698_10153868404289064_4333087836231597970_n.jpg?oh=66d6e9874235de65ae2ad867cc4e13ca&oe=58D8CEBB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153868404289064&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-29T05:19:17+0000	1464499157	2016-05-29 07:19:17	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s the only supermarket I know of in Sheffield with disability carts  as I am non weight bearing on my left leg  these enable to shop.  Unfortunately I was told by the lady staffing the customer service desk that the only working cart is in use. It meant my mum had to do the shopping. The point of the exercise was to persuade her I can be independent but it seems I am not. So she is meandering around a store she doesn t know looking for items on the list.   As we leave the store we find disability cart abandoned by an inconsiderate customer by the door  instead the parking spot for it. The trolley guy asked if I needed to use it and I explained that I hadn t been able to get some of the stuff I needed as I hadn t been able to get around. A manager came up with the key for it and said it had been in the office all day. He tried the key and the cart did not move  obviously the battery was discharged.   Both these latter staff did their best in the situation to remedy the lack of disabled accessibility and are a credit to Tesco s.   The sour note is that the staff member covering the customer service desk had misled me and also did nothing to remedy the situation. This had an impact on my response to the lack of helpfulness of Tesco On Line support  no excuse just honesty					2016-05-28T22:26:08+0000	1464474368	2016-05-29 00:26:08	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I try to access my on-line account set up in the midst of time when I was hopping from address to address. I cannot remember what my password is. I use the reset password  which sends me a link  this requires my mregistration address postcode. I do not remember which address I was living at when I registered so no chance of remembering the postcode.  There s a telephone number which I call  once I find the actual right option I get through to a customer service agent  I explain that I cannot reset my password as I cannot remember my address at the time of registration and therefore the postcode. The call starts well with the taking of my email address  then I am asked for the first line of my address  that s right the address I have already told them I cannot remember. Explain that that is the problem  if I knew the address I could find the postcode. The respond was  well  I cannot help you if you don t give it . I lost my temper and shouted at her. She said she wasn t going to be shouted at. I requested a manager. I terminated the call when the old there is not a manager available you ll have to wait trick was pulled.  The response to I cannot change my password because I don t know what the answer is and then insisting on that piece of information showed that 1 - they had not listened to me  2 - they were working a tick box exercise and cannot think outside the box  I m sure I provide my mother s maiden and a security word when I registered so long ago  3 - they could not be bothered to assist a customer. I understand that measures need to be taken to ensure data security  but intransigence is not the answer.  I have now checked the postcodes of every address I ve lived at for the last 15 years  none of the post codes match; that s 7 post codes and 8 addresses.   Tesco s accessibility rating today is zero.  Asda s minimum on-line shop is ¬£25 so I will continue to use them for on line purchases and as Sainsbury s has a better local prescence in Sheffield use them in preference. It will not make a dent in Tesco s profits but it will make me feel better					2016-05-28T21:25:07+0000	1464470707	2016-05-28 23:25:07	0	10	0	0	10	10	4	6	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not appropriate for an older lady.  Staff on duty couldn t find any alternatives in warehouse.  Staff on customer service desk couldn t find the complaints book!  Not enough staff on checkouts  forcing checkout operator to apologise for wait.  These are the reasons I no longer shop in Tesco unless there is no alternative.  Prices aren t competitive either.

My sister is going through very gruelling chemotherapy at the moment which makes day to day tasks difficult. She went into the store today to do some shopping.  I normally take her (as I did yesterday so why she needed more is beyond me lol) I was working today and her husband was in bed after a week of night shifts.  Caroline Porter who works in the store arranged for her shopping to be taken to the car for her.  Acts of kindness like this blow me away.  I can t be with my darling sister 24/7 I wish I could but knowing that there are genuine kind people out there willing to help makes such a difference.  Keep up the good work all of you and huge thanks again especially to Caroline.					2016-05-28T19:51:30+0000	1464465090	2016-05-28 21:51:30	120	21	128	4	153	21	9	12	31	0	120	8	0	0	0	0	0

I was in your Linwood store today  40 weeks pregnant  by myself. I had quite a heavy basket and was struggling to carry it to the till  when a blonde  female member of staff approached me and asked if I would like her help to carry it. It made my day  and it s lovely to see that she cares so much about her customers  as well as her job. Just thought this amazing act of kindness deserved a mention... Didn t catch her name  but she is definitely a valued member of staff!!					2016-05-28T19:02:21+0000	1464462141	2016-05-28 21:02:21	14	6	14	0	20	6	3	3	5	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was crying and about to run into traffic. I ran over and grabbed his hand and was trying to talk to him when another kind lady came over and said she d take him into the store as she was going in anyway (i had just left and was putting my kids and shopping in the car). Does anyone know if he found his mum? I was about another 5-10mins in the car park and his mum was nowhere in sight!! He came from the direction of the train station so I m not even sure where he was lost! Poor little thing. I can t stop thinking about him x					2016-05-28T18:23:22+0000	1464459802	2016-05-28 20:23:22	2	6	2	0	8	6	5	1	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have  just come back from Spain where everything in their supermarkets looks twice the size of our UK produce & twice the quality. It s so enjoyable to shop over there and makes me feel angry at the pathetic produce we have to buy here.  To crown today off we were restricted to TWO hours shopping due to some event going on at the Arena or get a ¬£100 fine. Obviously want the Arena business over the weekly shoppers !!!   Perhaps we ought to go elsewhere in the future .					2016-05-28T16:58:06+0000	1464454686	2016-05-28 18:58:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner and I and two dogs were travelling in our motorhome and had broken down at 3.30pm about a mile from the store on the hard shoulder of the A4600. A Greenflag mechanic couldn t fix the vehicle and had to tow us to a safer place and chose your car park where we could await recovery.  I called in to the store to tell the security man what had happened and to check whether there was a parking time limit. A little while later a lady  Heather and a colleague knocked on our door to see if everything was ok and if we needed any help. I explained what had happened and also explained it was my partner s birthday and that we had been stranded for hours and it looked like we would be there for several more hours because the recovery services were so busy. Heather was chatting to and admiring our dogs who were sticking their heads out of a window to see what was going on!  A short while later Heather returned with a different colleague and brought a chocolate birthday cake  an alcohol free bottle of fizzy and two packs of dog treats to cheer us up. We were quite overwhelmed by the kindness and thoughtfulness shown. It contrasted so starkly against the very poor service we were receiving from Greenflag!  We have posted this story on a motorhome Facebook page and it has over 200 likes and many comments with loads of people saying  well done Tescos . So again  many thanks from us  it really was the high point in a very dismal day. The cake was much appreciated particularly as we hadn t had any dinner and didn t actually get back home to Nottingham until 2.15am. It was so lovely to receive a human response rather than a bog standard corporate one. Well done.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13332726_10155048440154152_4620258769808369439_n.jpg?oh=dcea56ac5f8900cc8dc71a0bcddd021a&oe=591BE971	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13332726_10155048440154152_4620258769808369439_n.jpg?oh=d96ab08662d6d41b79013a03800cd07b&oe=59102D7C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155048440154152&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-28T16:37:34+0000	1464453454	2016-05-28 18:37:34	2936	137	3073	296	3506	134	105	29	592	0	2899	116	19	1	0	0	0

I could understand if I looked 17 and was doing some suspicious shopping for a bottle of cider and Doritos. I don t think many underage people come into your shop and do a ¬£250 shop with a 26 year old. I completely understand challenge 25 and used to work in a supermarket myself  but refusing to serve a 26 year old because their fiancee hasn t brought ID is just ridiculous.					2016-05-28T16:33:56+0000	1464453236	2016-05-28 18:33:56	2	4	2	0	6	4	4	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Do not go through the self service checkouts.  I purchased a handbag today at the Irvine store and did just that  unknowing that there was a tag on it.  No  this purchase needs to be approved  came up or anything to say a tag had to be removed. Paid for the item and luckily kept my receipt.  I was just out the door and got stopped by security and treated like a criminal  even although I produced my receipt.  Was taken back into the shop where the security tag was removed.  The security guard then proceeded to check through the rest of the bag to see if there was anything else in it.  I was given an apology but not before I had been publicly humiliated.  Be careful everyone.					2016-05-28T15:20:33+0000	1464448833	2016-05-28 17:20:33	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been offered a refund of only ¬£60  less than half what I spent on the product!! I understand that the product is out of warranty but most of this depreciation is caused by the fact that the product doesn t work. Never again will I be shopping at tesco.

For many days before my purchase last Thursday I felt a sudden urge within me. This urge was a long time coming and to be honest when one get s a tangy feel within them; it s hard to resist. I knew that one thing and one thing only would satisfy this urge. So  I decided like all citrus loving guys like me that I would pop into my local tesco store and buy a lemon tart. I can tell you when I returned home with my lemon tart I was more than just a sour puss. I was bitter and sad. My fetish for a lemon tart was not satisfied. I guess as the saying goes  when life gives you lemons  squeeze them in other people s eyes. So  on this occasion  Tesco  I virtually am squeezing the lemon I have into your eyes. The tart I bought was not zesty as advertised and I know a thing or two about zest. I demand  a refund.  A very bitter and sour customer  Phil.

My kids had saved up money and were promised they could buy a toy each. They had 9 pounds between them in change(including pound coins). My wife bought some things as well. However when they got to the till the cashier refused to accept the change from my children to pay for their toys. My wife ended up paying for the toys on her card. This has caused embarresment for my wife. What would have happened if we didn t have other funds available. We have shopped at this Tesco for over 10 years spending thousands and thousands of pounds and this is the service we receive . What would have happened if my wife couldn t have paid on her card would you just have refused to accept my kids hard earned pocket money. Really disappointed and not impressed Tesco!!					2016-05-28T11:30:50+0000	1464435050	2016-05-28 13:30:50	3	6	4	0	10	6	5	1	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	1	0

I ve left my Clubcard Vouchers to build up for a while to use during the gigantic school summer hols but  during May  Tesco are doubling your points! So  I ve got a decent amount of ¬£59 worth of Clubcard points to spend (which I appreciate may well be ¬£1 000s worth of expenditure on my Tesco credit card  but I don t care its only used for the necessities like Tesco food (delivered to my door) and fuel PLUS it s still money back converted into treats).  So I started browsing and I ve managed to get  wait for it  4 x Cineworld tickets  ¬£60 worth of Chef and Brewer vouchers  ¬£42 worth of Pizza Express vouchers (we do like our food) and 1 Countryfile 12 month magazine subscription (Dad s birthday) ALL for my ¬£59 Clubcard vouchers!

I was like huh! How! So the guy closed his till and walked me to the customer services till to find out what had happened  they were lovely and explained that I would need to call the number on my card as they were def saying  used in store  so I paid for my shopping  came home and rang club card  the person I spoke was friendly and polite and apologetic - think he said his name was Matt or Mark? He looked on his system and saw that the vouchers had been used at a store nearly 200 miles away from I live! So he promptly put the points back into my card and advised I change my passwords on my Tesco account just in case somebody has got my details somehow! Thankyou Tesco - it makes such a nice change to receive top customer services when there s an issue rather than getting hassle :)					2016-05-28T10:41:06+0000	1464432066	2016-05-28 12:41:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apparently nothing can be done before Tuesday. I now have a three year old in tears. Furthermore  I now have a boxed trampoline cluttering up the house when I have a houseful of visitors this weekend.

Did my weekly shopping tonight at my local Littlehampton Tesco  only to finish my shop and find that there are no checkout staff. I had no choice but to put my ¬£113 shop through the self service checkout whilst being watched by a smug member of staff  who I felt enjoyed watching me struggle trying to fit all my shopping on the weigh plate and despite having no other customers offered no help. I have a really sore back and as you can imagine it s very painful now from leaning over trying to pack my bags for half an hour! If this is a new policy  I understand but I should have been forewarned. I entered the store at 10pm and finished shopping at 10:50pm  finally left the store at 11:20pm feeling really angry  it s just not acceptable.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13254267_815799411898497_1546768406955467236_n.jpg?oh=ce9e4c445f7f9f926653a291188791a8&oe=5918A0DF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13254267_815799411898497_1546768406955467236_n.jpg?oh=46d497c9e7c1b2a087ed40c272c3e702&oe=591AA420	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=815799411898497&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-27T23:15:21+0000	1464390921	2016-05-28 01:15:21	0	7	2	3	12	7	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

Firstly I m greeted by the most ignorant staff ever who chose to talk to me like some toddler being scolded for taking mothers favourite bracelet out to play and losing it. Then they try to find it while I watch countless other people come and claim their cards without judgement. So I stand there like a lost child still reeling from my telling off only then for 15minutes later to be told they can t find it. Turns out they defecated all over procedure and shredded my card before they were supposed to. This point I m pretty annoyed and visibly upset to say the least. I then get told well sorry nothing we can do. They tell me to go to my bank to get money and a new card. Something I can t do as I m at work for 12hr shifts this weekend  if my fuel will make it that is. The girl just shrugs and walks away. Called to complain about my situation and basically got the same reaction  told they ll give more training to staff... Very unsympathetic apologies and no resolve.					2016-05-27T20:56:11+0000	1464382571	2016-05-27 22:56:11	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You advertise bundles that can be purchased so I brought the bundle that included the mcafee Internet security. Imagine my delight and getting it all set up for my daughter to start using  to receive the message on the Kindle fire showing that  mcafee security is not compatible with this device !!!! It appears you are falsely selling a product. I look forward to hearing from you with an explanation.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13263742_10153638569595920_1739207773693158603_n.jpg?oh=acf85018240f8724b4b8fee7a4683eda&oe=59125CC8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13263742_10153638569595920_1739207773693158603_n.jpg?oh=df4c8193e787d685a3e8c9b6d6cf964d&oe=590D8FC5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153638569595920&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-27T20:45:25+0000	1464381925	2016-05-27 22:45:25	4	8	4	0	12	8	7	1	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

After buying my daughter a My little pony Equestria doll. I have had to return 3 in less than one 2 weeks.  I understand that these are not exclusive to you but the quality of these dolls are shocking!!!  Arms and legs just falling off from just holding them.  My daughter was really upset as these are so popular at the moment.  The staff at the Bourne store were lovely and let her pick something else all 3 times.  After reading reviews from other mums I can see there is a big problem with this and I would have thought you would like to know if you don t already.  Thank you for letting her have her pocket money back and being able to buy a toy that doesn t beak every time you pick it up.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13260116_10206751592290570_2279211074243773624_n.jpg?oh=d236fbabfa53156a61c8192c9de8a412&oe=591E01C8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13260116_10206751592290570_2279211074243773624_n.jpg?oh=36bada608a52ce1753f4a530d000c62b&oe=591455C5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206751592290570&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-27T20:19:08+0000	1464380348	2016-05-27 22:19:08	0	2	0	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst eating your bbq maple pork  we have discovered glass in our food. This photographed is just one of the larger peices. Tesco customer services were unhelpful telling us the only action we can do is to return it to the store with the receipt and packaging. How much can the store really do and I feel we should receive more support in a complaint as serious as this?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13325694_10154140900796153_6335166003327762455_n.jpg?oh=3a705f3cc62cc81b204a33bee79fb0fb&oe=58DC4EC6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13325694_10154140900796153_6335166003327762455_n.jpg?oh=ae75c94c5389a1576cf0d0b95c905473&oe=591A27CB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154140900796153&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-27T19:05:01+0000	1464375901	2016-05-27 21:05:01	1	10	1	3	14	10	3	7	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I bought some beans  within date  but found that some of them were rotten  see picture. I wouldn t normally complain  but this is not the first time in the last few weeks. In this case  had I left them a couple of days  the rotten ones would have turned more. Within the last few weeks I have had to throw away three quarters of a punnet of strawberries  half a punnet of blueberries and almost a whole pack of chantenay carrots  all within date. I would normally go into the store to complain  but won t be able to this weekend.

We go into the Market Harborough petrol station shop almost every day and spend upwards of ¬£10 each time! Today my sister was purchasing a bottle of alcohol on the meal deal - she had her ID - she was the one purchasing the items. I didn t have ID myself. I have shown my alcohol every other time I have been in there. But we were told she couldn t buy it. I drove all the way home and went back with ID - she would not sell us the bottle of alcohol that was included in the ¬£10 meal deal - which we paid ¬£10.80 for  as we had already bought the food without it.  I explained to her in surprise that my sister did that because she wouldn t sell us the alcohol! I said - you have just seen us buy the food  surely we are entitled to the bottle of fizz as part of that.   I am almost 26 years of age  my sister and I are twins  we go in nearly every day and to be treated with such suspicion from the employee who was frankly rude and blas√© about the situation - even though I had done what was asked - was dreadful.   On an evening when all I want to do is celebrate finishing my law degree  my sister had offered to buy us the meal deal  I feel angry and let down!					2016-05-27T18:18:37+0000	1464373117	2016-05-27 20:18:37	0	10	0	0	10	10	6	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were evacuated from our school and were camped out at another local school but we were not allowed back into our school to collect money or food they not only were prepared to let us have the food we were after on  credit  till we could go and get some money when we returned for more bread later they informed us that we could have it for free! It was a very stressful situation for us to be in and to be able to feed the kids made it so much easier! Thank you from me and everyone at my school!!

I ordered Call of Duty Black Ops III (PS4) with my PS4  and CoD was in stock. I collected the rest of my order  but CoD was never dispatched. I double checked I ordered it  and confirmed it was on my invoice. I asked on Live Chat and your agent said it was out of stock so you wouldn t honour it. It was IN STOCK when I ordered  AND when we spoke on Live Chat. He also said he d email me the transcript  but didn t  so lied about that too. So I emailed Tesco Direct instead  and was told it wouldn t be fulfilled because it was subject to availability. Again  in stock when I emailed  and in stock when I got the reply. I m blatantly being lied to. I don t want to give up on Tesco for buying my tech  but this is really disappointing. Can you help please?					2016-05-27T14:01:04+0000	1464357664	2016-05-27 16:01:04	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered this ball for my dog Tj to be delivered on Monday evening  I actually ordered two because anyone who knows Springer s knows how quickly they destroy toys and at ¬£4 it was never going to last long right? I figured a few hours of squeaking and all the fun would be over by lunchtime Tuesday. Wrong... very very wrong. The bloody things must be made of self mending rubber or something as 4 days later there isn t a tooth mark in it and I ve had to buy ear plugs to save myself going deaf. He s more than happy to that s good  me.... I have had night mares revolving around sqeakers the last 3 nights! Managed to hide one ball but this one has literally been in his gob since Tuesday morning. It was actually highly amusing watching him trying to work out how to eat a treat with the ball in his mouth still!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13310385_1179494078769179_6306783972099748667_n.jpg?oh=2b8f85342a295c22fc4bd085c4f1f09e&oe=591E7D9A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13310385_1179494078769179_6306783972099748667_n.jpg?oh=0c3f56a091e958b407a6523fffb35d9d&oe=5921AD8F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1179494078769179&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-27T09:50:56+0000	1464342656	2016-05-27 11:50:56	13	10	21	0	31	8	4	4	16	0	13	2	0	6	0	0	0

So  it is 07.01 in the morning and the movement of trolleys wakes us up.  This is after someone doing the same thing at 06.54 last Sunday that resulted in my going round to the garage and politely reminding the Team Leader on duty of the agreement.  Is it fair that neighbours should be disturbed at unsocial hours by staff who clearly disregard their Manager s instructions?  Oh I forgot to mention - my wife is suffering from terminal cancer and needs all the rest she can get!!!!!

I purchased 8 Naturo Adult Dog foods last week to take away on holiday. Discovered one to be blown. Unfortunately for me  I walk my dogs at 6 AM so at 7 AM when I pass the store there is not on single person who can deal with the product. The clue is in the name Customer Service starts and ends with the Customer not the convenience of the store.					2016-05-27T06:12:18+0000	1464329538	2016-05-27 08:12:18	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It wasn t the first time and it certainly wasn t the last  it has been a really hard year. That journey is still long from over  sadly for me and now my beautiful daughter in this photo who is ill herself. You really start to notice who your true friends and family are when you become so chronicly Ill.  Everytime i was re admittied and stuck in a hospital bed for weeks these guys would pop up and talk to me and keep me company  take my mind of everything for a while and even just listen to me rant. Take away my fears before surgerys and my biggest fear when i was reduced to using a wheelchair on my worst days. People that I have never met and have no responsibility to care showed me nothing but love. Every single one of them are just amazing beautiful funny people who do nothing but work hard and try to make a difference. You really did make a difference to me and my life and for that I can t thank you enough. You helped give me the motivation to fight and not be ashamed.  So a huge huge thank you Joel and the amazing team for helping me through such a rubbish time. Keeping my hopes up. You don t know how much it has ment for me. I mean of course  every little helps! ‚ù§	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13263731_910299685759844_7399314320704773878_n.jpg?oh=7142bc06fdad2cdfa58635de3ae1123f&oe=5911295D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13263731_910299685759844_7399314320704773878_n.jpg?oh=94447f4ca72205c0daed609c63605452&oe=58D62CA2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=910299685759844&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-26T23:53:43+0000	1464306823	2016-05-27 01:53:43	3	11	3	0	14	10	2	8	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I shop in Tesco at Whitfield  Dover and staff there are always helpful and cheery. The store seems to have a good culture and atmosphere. I keep reading in the media about wage cuts and I hope that you (Tesco managers) are not  in any way  going to cut wages or benefits or downgrade working conditions for staff who give your customers good service.

I cooked this for 4.5 hours and found the meat chewy  tough and totally inedible. Very disappointing. How do I go about getting a refund for this and everything else I put in the dish that I was not able to eat.

Today  I was shopping alone with my two year old son using the self scan facility. During my shop I felt like I was constantly being watch. I notice after a few minutes I was in fact being followed by a man down every aisle right up to the checkout. I became very frightened and scared as I fear we would be followed to the car park.   After paying I stalled before leaving the store as the strange man was lurking by the doors. I eventually decided to leave at which point I was approached and informed it was in fact a Tesco employing following scan a you shop customer to ensure all items were scanned.  I put my shopping in the car and then lodged a complaint with customer service who did not seem bothered  I was left upset and cried in my car. I will not shop without my husband in future . I was really concerned for mine and my sons safety.  I feel really let down by Tesco.					2016-05-26T17:39:19+0000	1464284359	2016-05-26 19:39:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sadly they were dense  stodgy  lacked flavour and sugar coating. Worst of all the custard in the middle was really quite disgusting  it has split and resembled scrambled egg more than custard. This was quite disappointing. And has since left me feeling quite sick :(	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13256451_10206038288588698_384288239457600702_n.jpg?oh=4fcc175c40e54f4f798b76fa69e2b768&oe=58DBBA8D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13256451_10206038288588698_384288239457600702_n.jpg?oh=6818daa0f64a5d924ce1316d6602e182&oe=59227CF1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206038288588698&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-26T17:06:41+0000	1464282401	2016-05-26 19:06:41	27	2	28	1	31	2	1	1	3	0	27	0	0	0	1	0	0

I was worried that we would have to cancel his test but I hadn t bargained on Natalie coming to our rescue.  She said if we ordered them in they wouldn t be here in time but she looked through a box of glasses that they keep.  There looked to be hundreds of pairs but she looked through them and found a pair that she could put the lenses in. She said it would take about 20 minutes to fix swap them over so we went and did a bit of shopping. When we came back she said she couldn t get them in but she would ask Helen to do them in the morning and we could collect them after 9am. That was fine and off we went home. At 745 we received a call from Natalie saying she had done them!!! I would have kissed her had we been face to face.  We went in today at 930 am to be greeted by a lovely lady called Helen who asked if it was Daniel. When we said it was she was so kind to him wishing him well on his test. I just wanted to say a huge thank you to them both as they both went above and beyond to help us.   P.s. Daniel passed his test!!!!!!					2016-05-26T14:10:57+0000	1464271857	2016-05-26 16:10:57	107	13	111	11	135	13	10	3	34	0	106	4	0	0	0	0	0

The driver drove off after two further attempts to turn (clearly not hearing the and of the guttering shattering and seeing the mess of it all over my garden.  A neighbour witnessed it and contacted Tesco. The driver came up and was apologetic but didn t remember it but I was passed onto Plexus Insurance to deal with it. Now I m told that the driver has no recollection of it happening and as the witness is my neighbour he s not independent as he could be a friend.... Frustrating isn t the word. What can I do here?!!!

I am against testing on animals and find it increasingly hard to find/locate products that are not tested on animals. What would be REALLY helpful would be if you could have a section of the cruelty free products you sell so that people like myself can go straight there instead of having to search around between all the other products to find the humane ones. Do you think there would be a possibility of this happening? I think think it would be welcomed with open arms by a lot of your customers.

Waist of money no wonder we live in a time of obesity as u wouldn t find a bar of chocolate or packet of crisps go off in a couple of days or even on its sell by date.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13312864_10156863325240212_6949766033389138069_n.jpg?oh=278f6d03d2126cc29e4ab5698e7e12aa&oe=590652E3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13312864_10156863325240212_6949766033389138069_n.jpg?oh=4b641772a96a4b18176292bc768e7661&oe=591A91EE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156863325240212&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-26T09:47:11+0000	1464256031	2016-05-26 11:47:11	5	9	5	0	14	8	3	5	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

The great advantage of the Tesco Extra petrol stations for me is that my car is mapped for 99ron fuel so it only gets Momentum 99 or Shell Vpower. If I am stuck I can stretch to 97ron but just enough to get me elsewhere...  So imagine my surprise when I found the Tesco Express near me does not sell Momentum 99ron... Even though it s available at other petrol stations. Not only that but SuperUnleaded 97ron is nearly 10p a litre more expensive than 99ron at the supermarket... A total rip off. Fortunately for me there s a Shell Garage a little further out!  But what astounds me is the service at this particular store. There s always a queue in the store and never enough people on the tills. But what has really P****d me off is that there are 24hr pumps that are turned off when the store is shut! I arrived home from work late last night with a choice. I had enough fuel to get to Tesco or Shell.. Knowing Shell was 24hrs but Tesco had 24hr pumps and was nearer it was an easy decision... Until at 05:15 I m sat on the forecourt with all the pumps set to  kiosk only  and not enough fuel to get anywhere else.... Where is the logic in that???? It s totally irrelevant that I ran out of fuel trying to get to another fuel station and had to walk 2 miles in the rain when you consider just how much money you must be losing every day by this poor and inconvenient decision. If your going to insist on having 24hr pump facilities that aren t switched on 24hrs a day the least you can do is or a sign on them that states  not 24hrs   so people using them know that when they need fuel outside shop opening hours to go elsewhere. Or  if it was an error and they should be 24hrs someone needs a disciplinary.					2016-05-26T06:12:23+0000	1464243143	2016-05-26 08:12:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Even though the cafe was closing. Thank you. I don t have your name but you made my sons day.

A few months ago in Shoreham they locked the nozzles down on the 24hr pay at pump machines (which I complained about on here) and now I ve just tried to fill up in Horsham (at 3am) and someone has turned all the 24hr pay at pumps into pay at kiosk only pumps!! üò± But the kiosk  of course at that time of night  was CLOSED. I dread to think how many people have driven up  filled up and driven off! It s completely unbelievable not even mentioning how inconvenient to people at that time of night that are running low on fuel. If you re going to offer 24hr fuel it should be 24hrs and reliable! It was easier to buy fuel in Zimbabwe....and THAT is saying something. Come on Tesco..when I worked for you in 2003 you weren t this disorganised.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13312601_10156900120590368_7227319568147524511_n.jpg?oh=7ce97535baebd7710e335503976ea99d&oe=58DC0A59	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13312601_10156900120590368_7227319568147524511_n.jpg?oh=2976dbf1bd5a839ec65d2c2c62f0aa1a&oe=5919D254	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156900120590368&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-26T02:52:13+0000	1464231133	2016-05-26 04:52:13	4	11	4	0	15	11	3	8	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

IVE had it now 3rd separate issue with Tesco in a Month!! HOW hard is it SERIOUSLY..How hard is it for you to sort out an issue that s taken 4 days to sort out  causing me unnecessary stress and various phone calls.  It s still not resolved. I seriously wonder why I shop with you. Spent 3 hours of my time at your store Monday evening  which ended up making me get stuck in heavy traffic going home  wasted my evening  resulting in causing distress and tension to family and me   whilst on your customer service phone speaking to clubcard and tesco direct over the !!!.... Boost points. You ve not resolved it. It s still causing a problem now  as now I can t take the opportunity to double up. The first time ever that I decide to double up and not use vouchers on petrol and it goes tips up....MAKE it clearer to dimwits such as me  (got the impression of being a dimwit by one your store team) ( It was embarrassing for me to see staffs reaction to a seriously confused shopper  and to be made to feel a fool  in front of other staff members)  that even though Tesco is Tesco  one company  you are all different departments. So cheers Tesco  I raise a glass to you  for your team member on the phone who dictated to team member in store to rip up my exchanged boost points receipt. Now I have no physical original points coupon or doubled points receipt to double up in store  or double up online. You sent an email tonight saying points coupon will be returned to me in next statement. Guess that will be after 26th June when the double points boost will be over!!! So GREAT  I miss out on your last deal. Ive never shopped on your website  so how the hell   am I aware that the online price is different. It s not that clear to me  or a dyslexic. Ive seem items on other company s website and it s so clear that the price is an online price.  Not that clear to me with your website. The impression I get from TESCOS website it s that price considering it says check stock available in a Tesco store. Same principle as Argos do.. Originally rung up club card Monday afternoon as I couldn t figure how to double up and also couldn t access clubcard webpage. Your clubcard team said it would be easy to double up in store and could buy the item with no hassle and it would take all the stress out of trying to get my head around the website.

I registered for a Clubcard and received it in the post a couple of months ago. I shop online frequently and almost never in store. I only have 69 points on my card from when it was scanned just this one time at the store. But it s not registering my online shop points and I should have hundreds by now.   My club card is registered to the account I have. Why are they not automatically transferring? I only shop at Tesco because they give a little back to their customers but I m rather miffed as to why I haven t been benefiting from the points collection					2016-05-25T22:09:13+0000	1464214153	2016-05-26 00:09:13	0	15	0	0	15	15	2	13	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Then by accident I picked up a Toshiba controller for another T.V that I have and found that worked the Digihome Telly  I then realised that you could then set up the Digihome T.V to work on the Sky remote by using the Toshiba code.

I received an email stating my order was ready to collect from my local store as it had been scanned in at 12.50pm today. This was also evident through the parcel tracking service. However  going to the store this evening (8pm) I was told my the deputy store manager that the store did not have the parcel. He told me I should have a received store collection email and that I couldn t have as it wasn t there. As I argued my case for receiving one  he said he would call the helpline to track the parcel and came back saying they closed at 8pm?  I however  have just called (9pm) and spoke to a representative who confirmed for me the tracking states the parcel is with the store and could even tell me the staff members name it was signed in by. The call representative phoned the store for me herself and I was put on hold. She came back telling me the store was very adamant they did not have the parcel and the member of staff it was signed in by was apparently not even in store today as she is currently away on holiday. The call representative had no other option than to order a replacement as she herself was confused with the whole situation.  This makes me question whether a staff member at your store has faked this staffs signature as acceptance for the delivery whilst they are on holiday and stole it. I can not understand how it was signed and accepted for by a staff member who was not even working. How is the tracking telling me it has be scanned in at the store and the store have no recollection of this.  Please may you help me with this very confusing and mysterious problem.  Many thanks					2016-05-25T20:35:14+0000	1464208514	2016-05-25 22:35:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My little girl was excited to try on her big girl school uniform in preparation for her starting school in September  she loved it so much  she didn t want to take it off. After finally getting her out of it I washed it at 40 and tumbled on cool  as per instructions. Look how much it has shrunk!! It would only fit my toddler now! Disappointed in my first uniform purchase from you  I was expecting better quality.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13265860_10156941059295721_3609418787201932297_n.jpg?oh=cc238270e36bd09cc673625995370563&oe=5915CE11	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13265860_10156941059295721_3609418787201932297_n.jpg?oh=64adf4af921c43d4127bf2b6e183a866&oe=5915ED1C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156941059295721&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-25T20:04:52+0000	1464206692	2016-05-25 22:04:52	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Supposedly they do not log any calls or notes on their system so have no record of who messed it up last time. Bloke on the phone says it s an easy thing to do yet somehow it s already been messed up! You need to start logging calls as I am not even able to complain  ridiculous! Now when my wife is back it looks like a further 15 mins on hold so that s 30mins to merge 2 cards that I was assured would be done correctly first time round.

I ve worn a ring on that finger for well over a year and there has been no problems   however when I looked at my finger I seen it was red itchy and very sore it felt like I had burnt it.   I later realised it was a type of chemical burn! From which was from your products!   We have used this brand for quite at while at work and nothing has happened to me or anyone else for that matter.   However we bought new bottles of antibacterial that day and I noticed that the nozzle was different and had been remodelled.   I know you might say that I should have worn gloves when cleaning but in your product it states there is no bleach so I never thought To do so.   I work for children and used this product in a childcare setting which is why it bothers me so much! Id like parents and anyone else who uses this product to be aware until tesco have resolved the issue.  I require to be heard back to asap!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13260244_10207622999066836_8191417219499456501_n.jpg?oh=5dad40e3940696c294ec207424c93bc5&oe=59073E62	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13260244_10207622999066836_8191417219499456501_n.jpg?oh=277781778a0a97d719c745ba2adf01ab&oe=590AA6C5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207622999066836&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-25T17:45:48+0000	1464198348	2016-05-25 19:45:48	7	11	8	1	20	11	5	6	2	0	6	0	0	1	0	0	0

We bought two to share but as you can see one of them has so little cheese it is going to leave some of us without any cheesy goodness on our garlic bread. It also does not have 4 pieces of cheese on the entire thing so is definitely not 4 cheese.  Maybe a re brand to  Where s the Cheese  in a similar vein to Where s Wally then it becomes a fun game to see if you get any or not :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13241175_10209584522032476_5286139560234702121_n.jpg?oh=df3290916cec52e27e68109cc1703b5e&oe=59060E84	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13241175_10209584522032476_5286139560234702121_n.jpg?oh=1ebfe0313d927195be864619b3201d65&oe=591B9989	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209584522032476&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-25T16:31:02+0000	1464193862	2016-05-25 18:31:02	12	1	17	1	19	1	1	0	1	0	12	0	0	3	0	2	0

What s ¬£6.33  add ¬£31.58  add ¬£35.35  add ¬£209.74?  I make it ¬£283  how about you? The same  right?   So - what s your policy on charging a customer for an item they never received? And invoicing them for said item  and then telling them  after it fails to turn up  that it s being cancelled due to there not being any stock  despite stock being clearly visible online and available for purchase? Cos  that s just what happened to me!   Your  customer service  staff don t seem to understand that it s extremely poor form to charge a customer for something  not bother to tell the customer in advance that they re not getting the item because *reasons*  and then refuse to do anything when said customer has the nerve to complain about this lack of basic courtesy (and the fact you have some of my money despite your staff s steadfast refusal to supply me with the goods requested).  The way I see it  you either owe me ¬£6.33  or you owe me a copy of the game I ve paid for  that s  out of stock   even though it s actually in stock  but is apparently  allocated to a different promotion . I m happy to square this up by just sending you an invoice  that I will expect paid  for something I have no intention of providing to you  if that s how you want to do business  though - let me know what s easiest for you?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13255914_10100179181039328_750674280839839185_n.jpg?oh=9b40bc06ebde54e14eda04576c29973c&oe=590D9814	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13255914_10100179181039328_750674280839839185_n.jpg?oh=2511c85c975ef4b5904b69722f98efd6&oe=590FA201	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100179181039328&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-25T15:32:15+0000	1464190335	2016-05-25 17:32:15	3	11	3	0	14	10	1	9	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter has come out of school today having made some chocolate cornflake cakes for a tea party tomorrow. I asked the teacher if I could see the packaging and of course it s got barley in it. Now the standard Tesco own brand cornflakes come up as fine on the Coeliac UK Directory but I can t find any info about the Everyday Value. I just spoke to someone on the phone at Tesco who said he wouldn t risk it. Does anyone have a more definitive answer? She d love to eat the cake she made at tomorrow s tea party but I m probably going to recreate them with some  safe  cornflakes!! Thanks! x					2016-05-25T15:08:23+0000	1464188903	2016-05-25 17:08:23	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got to my mothers to take it out the packaging and instead of finding a nice box full of Lego I find TWO RUBBISH BINS!!!

There is no control over the way people park in your car parks. There is regularly a line of cars right across the front of the store parked on double yellow lines  the cross hatched areas at the end of the parking bays have always got cars parked in them and the pick up and drop off lay-by is always full of parked cars. I m sure I don t need to tell you the danger this incredible selfishness causes your customers due to restricted sight lines and manoeuvring space. I do not understand why the security personnel cannot ask these people to park in one of the bays provided  they are always right at the front entrance to the store and will either be looking at a monitor or chatting to their mates on customer services so it would give them something to do.

I went in today to pick up some bits with my daughter and nephew  both 19 months old. My daughter had a strop on and pretty much screamed from the second I put her in the trolley. She d been very poorly the week before and hasn t been herself since. I had about 20 minutes of stares and comments from customers and was at the point of a breakdown when a lovely member of staff came up to me! She asked if there was anything she could do to help and asked if I was ok! She could clearly see I was stressed so asked if she wanted me to hold on to my trolley or help me to the tills. I declined out of embarrassment but she took me to the tills anyway and unloaded all my shopping whilst I saw to my daughter. Another worker then came over and packed all my shopping and then asked if I needed him to take it to the car for me! They both showed genuine concern for me and my daughter and went out of their way to help! They helped make a seriously stressed mums day :)					2016-05-24T21:49:49+0000	1464126589	2016-05-24 23:49:49	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I happened to look at the fresh bakery section and noticed that a lot of the bread had todays date on it  along with numerous fruit pies  muffins etc. After asking a member of staff whether these were due to be reduced given the date  I was informed  no - we don t reduce the bakery section  it gets disposed off . As a small family on a budget I find it absurd that these items would go to waste rather than being sold to a customer reduced who could put them to use. You state in your mission that  every little makes a big difference  - it does Tesco...you might want to follow it....					2016-05-24T21:16:10+0000	1464124570	2016-05-24 23:16:10	1	20	1	0	21	20	2	18	9	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I appreciate the bays are near the back of the store and the staff entrance but seeing as they re going to be parked for a number of hours whilst working  hardly seems appropriate to park in what are often quite hard to come by bays anyway! üòè					2016-05-24T21:14:43+0000	1464124483	2016-05-24 23:14:43	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Most of them have not been filled in the right places with the matching prices so it is very diseptive. After 3 times at customer service I finally located the ones required however on approaching them a 4th time I was told I could not purchase them as they were not in the system. Whereby they were taken away. They were not even able to suggest an alternative.  I feel devalued as a customer and none of the staff seemed interested.					2016-05-24T21:11:27+0000	1464124287	2016-05-24 23:11:27	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a fridge from tesco that stopped working after 18 months. The manufacturer would repair it but only for a charge which was  not economically viable but tesco stepped in and made up the difference in cost. Thank you.

We were trying to purchase the Meal Deal for ¬£10 and the Peroni beer was out of stock on the shelf. A fresh food colleague called Andy was behind us and without any prompting offered to go and find us the Peroni. He brought it out and it was in a box marked as Display On Meal Deal but it didn t have the usual cardboard surround on the two pack of bottles  which he thought was unusual. When we got to the self scan till the Peroni wouldn t scan. A very helpful young man called Jake went with me to where the meal deal was and quickly found out that the Peroni had the incorrect barcode  and took the ticket to scan at self scan. Both colleagues showed a genuine willingness to assist us and were polite and friendly throughout. I think they deserve a special mention. To often amazing customer service goes unrecognised. So please give them recognition and a massive congratulations on doing their job so well üòÉ					2016-05-24T20:07:28+0000	1464120448	2016-05-24 22:07:28	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I arrived at home it was infected with bugs & black eggs. I then called customer service and went to the shop to give that back. I came back home and the second lettuce was infected as well. @Tesco staff checked the rest of the stock in the shop after I insisted to remove those items as other people were buying them. They opened 4 and they were all infected  they took them away. After 3 visits to the store  hours involved with this disgusting issue I called today your customer service number and I was treated very badly  aggressive & patronizing. The lady over the phone told me that she will give me ¬£15 for the inconvenience  then she asked her manager and they gave me a ¬£20 voucher (I refused to take that). In a very sarcastic way she basically passed me to the store so I can discuss the matter with them.  If I had those lettuces with eggs and live bugs I could have been very sick. This is just 1 picture of 9 I took yesterday including a video. I got the worse customer service ever   your staff do not care abour your customers. They don t care about our health. I hope people can see today how Tesco is treating us.

Once in store I have to say the nonchalant attitude I was approached with was less than satisfactory. I was told  oh sorry there s nothing we can do about it  then I was offered another pack of raspberries (no thanks!) and a refund.  Really you would think some sort of care would be given to something tick-like and crawling freely around fruit and would raise some sort of concern? Or is it only me who would think of the possibly of eggs in something I was just about the feed to a child?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13254418_10154829581219018_7502447416839507000_n.jpg?oh=942bf6abaa57391c708c1aca6d5b38a9&oe=58D7C7F8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13254418_10154829581219018_7502447416839507000_n.jpg?oh=776efbeee11bdfc5fb404c1ea111e323&oe=58DCB7F5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154829581219018&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-24T18:19:04+0000	1464113944	2016-05-24 20:19:04	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The fact that I cannot purchase any alcohol without an Irish drivers licence  an Irish ID card or a passport is simply discriminating.  I came from Germany to work here in Cork City. I pay my taxes  I m a responsible person and like to enjoy an evening after a rough day at the office with a glass of wine. Nothing wrong with that.  Nevertheless this is apparently a privilege that may be enjoyed by Irish habitants only. I am 25 years old and always have my European identity card with me. Not to mention that as being in Europe  I don t need to provide my passport to enter this country at the airport whatsoever. Hence it is not ensured that I even have a passport.  So why do I feel like an illegal immigrant when I am denied to purchase any kind of alcohol at Tesco.  It is humiliating and makes me feel less of a part of this Irish society in which I set foot.  For me there is no logical explanation for this policy but that Tesco only wants to have  real Irish  customers.  Thanks for reading this. Just something I needed to say.					2016-05-24T16:36:33+0000	1464107793	2016-05-24 18:36:33	11	17	12	1	30	16	7	9	16	0	11	1	0	0	0	0	0

Not only did they both feel quite sick at the thought of what they had eaten but they went hungry and wouldn t then eat the remaining items that were in their lunch boxes so that s the cost of the thins  tuna and mayonnaise and all the fruit and extras that were also wasted!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13239312_10206018375008329_5019433755361866494_n.jpg?oh=84e0311495ae6cb62a9152a07849978f&oe=58D7F8DE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13239312_10206018375008329_5019433755361866494_n.jpg?oh=e9aa4dd682dc7074a88a989cfefce181&oe=591ECDD3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206018375008329&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-24T16:28:32+0000	1464107312	2016-05-24 18:28:32	0	23	2	2	27	23	4	19	18	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

The first time I gave the benefit of the doubt  but this has now happened twice. I have a photo but the hair is obviously very difficult to see.   I look foward to hearing your thoughts on this issue.					2016-05-24T16:17:43+0000	1464106663	2016-05-24 18:17:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had run out of petrol and had to put some in. My daughter who always runs in to pay as I send her in because of the long Que. today however I had a sickness bug and also have spots I m assuming is related to chicken pox so didn t want to affect anyone else so made my 16 year old go in  she has been served petrol many times before so didn t see this as a problem before putting petrol in the car. On this attempt she was refused because of her school uniform (never have they been bothered before) as I walked into the store the cashier who was serving shouted out she was sorry but could serve someone underage since when is 16 underage to purchase petrol? I explained I had a sickness bug and she was 16 and I didn t want to infect anyone she carry on talking to me even through she had a customer.  I had to return to my car as my daughter had the cash however when I walked back into the store the cashier was telling another customer about myself and daughter loud enough for the whole line to hear.   I feel the service I received was unprofessional embarrassing and I will be telling people in the local area how appalling the store is in Chadwell st Mary s  grays.   I would also like to point out they have let my 10 year old pay for petrol in the past so if it s the case my 16 year old can t but my 10year old can I will be making a formal complaint to the relevant people.					2016-05-24T16:08:15+0000	1464106095	2016-05-24 18:08:15	0	8	0	0	8	8	5	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In there shopping with my 13 year old son and his friend and when I went outside they were outside as they had been thrown out.  Apparently they were throwing a ball to each other when he came up and told them to get out. No warning just out! No even asking them to stop.  I told them outside they shouldn t be doing it and they understood that.  I took them back in the get the things they wanted whereby the security guard then proceeded to tell them to get out again. I explained they were with me and that I was supervising them.  So you think it was ok what they did he asked.  I told him I didn t and that I had told them off.  They were being disruptive he said in a busy store.  Really they were 6ft apart throwing a kids ball to each other.  Not acceptable I know but he could have at least warned them first. He was then rude to me said you re obviously a good parent then madam! They didn t even ask me if they could come back in he said. I told him I didn t know who had thrown them out so I couldn t ask him.  I asked him if they were banned  and he said no but you wouldn t think they would try to come straight back in! I said that is why I have come in with them! Absolutely disgusted with the the man rude and arrogant.  I wonder what he would have done if it was a toddler throwing a ball around.  Would he have thrown them out?					2016-05-24T16:06:12+0000	1464105972	2016-05-24 18:06:12	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The service from Selma was very quick and she even put the child s meal on two separate plates when I said that my 3 year old and 11 month old would be sharing the meal.  She also served the kids meals first which I think should be the policy in all restaurants as they didn t get grumpy seeing food on the table while waiting for their own meals.					2016-05-24T15:53:01+0000	1464105181	2016-05-24 17:53:01	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Several shops around the area had lost power   a friend and myself were in one shop when power went down and the staff in that particular shop told us to put our shopping down and we had to leave the shop. We walked over to tescos who also had a power cut and they were running off back up generators   we done our shop and got what we needed  as we got to the tills we could only pay cash and there was a long wait.   Staff were absolutely amazing with all customers keeping them up to date with what s going on and helping out in every way possible. They were certainly under alot of pressure but dealt with it the best way possible.  Just wanted to say a massive well done to all the staff there day and a big thank you for making the wait alot better! .					2016-05-24T13:07:56+0000	1464095276	2016-05-24 15:07:56	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

( i dont like any of these) there isnt even any lower calorie wraps. but what annoyed me more is there is a big stand full of crisps and chocolate for your snack which you get part of the meal deal but there wasnt ONE thing that someone on a diet could have. not one bag of fruit!  i picked up a 50p bag of fruit from another part of the shop & took this too the till with me but i couldnt get it as part of the deal. i had too buy either crisps or chocolate.  i think thats bad i am on a diet and there was nothing for me too get at all. there needs too  be more selection and at least ONE snack which isnt full of calories! !					2016-05-24T12:40:31+0000	1464093631	2016-05-24 14:40:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called up straight away and collection was made to pick them up today and re deliver for today. The construction toy arrives all torn and open again! Luckily all the pieces are there this time  why are you sending stuff out with Hermes unpackaged they aren t known to be careful with things? I had to repackage to the stuff that came yesterday out of my own pocket because no courier would accept an item that is ripped open full of loose stuff!  I haven t received any coupons for over 6 months and I am still waiting for my Christmas savers money to be returned to me (it may not be much). No wonder I am finding myself shopping elsewhere!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13230210_10204602440900238_4328424833107424029_n.jpg?oh=56885836fc7013f9ab4108e72e902b75&oe=590B4F8C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13230210_10204602440900238_4328424833107424029_n.jpg?oh=7336387abf394dcf2e9b9f9426aec655&oe=5918BC81	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204602440900238&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-24T10:56:19+0000	1464087379	2016-05-24 12:56:19	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Massive fail for customer service today at your Seacroft store. I left without what I needed and nobody helping me. I went in to print some photos. Easy you say! The photo machine either wasn t working or it wasn t clear how to select photos to print. I asked the nice lady in customer support. Over the course of the next 10 minutes she put 2 calls out for tech support. They are very elusive aren t they? After no one coming I asked where they were. She replied upstairs on electrical. So guess what? Your customer had to go up and get them...to be told by a lady that she was the only one there and would be 10 minutes. She seemed under pressure and got frustrated at my frustration (which is unacceptable) so I went back downstairs and asked the nice customer service lady for the duty manager to complain. Guess what?? They were too busy (now 25 minutes into my ordeal and late for work without photos) he told her to call another manager called Barry..who thankfully arrived promptly...and didn t know how to work the photo machine despite admitting his love of digital photography in his spare time. We both agreed that the machine either wasn t working or wasn t clear. Barry didn t know which. After 40 minutes  no photos and completely shocked by my experience I left the store. Barry took my name and number for a manager to call and apologise... Now an hour late for work and was even made to Pay for my lunch instead of it being offered as a good will gesture for my experience. Not I have no Photos which were urgent for my business and its cost me money. Well done Tescos!					2016-05-24T09:51:46+0000	1464083506	2016-05-24 11:51:46	3	8	3	0	11	8	1	7	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you just explain why for the first time in 16 years if collecting club card points I wasn t sent any extra offers with my coupons? I thought you were obviously saving yourselves money so didn t send them out this time  but when my wife opened hers (and she spent less than I did!) she has 2 pages of double points  extra points and money off coupons but I sadly didn t get any of these					2016-05-24T07:10:28+0000	1464073828	2016-05-24 09:10:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have recently had a baby and while trying to pack my shopping away my daughter was fairly unsettled so while packing I was also trying to settle the little one. As such I was taking a little longer than usual  however I would have thought given the circumstances this would be ok. However  while still packing the assistant began to serve the next customer. He did only have one item so the assistant maybe just thought she would quickly deal with it  however she then began to serve the next customer in the queue before I had managed to finish packing my shopping onto my pram. I felt so rushed I decided to leave the checkout area and push the pram and shopping to the small seating area near the desks to sort it out properly. I appreciate I may have taken longer than normal to get through the checkout but I feel that it is wrong that I was made to feel rushed  specially with a newborn baby. I would like to add that although I took a bit longer it was nowhere near an excessive amount of time and I was not asked if I would like any help with my packing.The checkout assistant was fairly young and possibly did not appreciate that it is stressful enough to shop with a newborn  however I would have thought that while training  this may be something that was mentioned. I would really hate this to happen to any other new mums.					2016-05-24T06:44:05+0000	1464072245	2016-05-24 08:44:05	0	6	0	0	6	6	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly  full marks to you guys for the free from Cornettos.  I know you re not technically allowed to call them that but YOU know what they are and so do I. They ve revolutionised hot sunny days and I expect whoever has managed to make them allergy safe will be honoured by the Queen come new year because they re simply amazing. But these  Tesco....these are causing me some concern.  There s a very good reason your display picture shows the choccy all over the table. Because biting into this Magnum-esque delight although tasty is a VERY MESSY BUSINESS and may not be attempted without a bowl to catch the cascade of falling chocolate parting company with the ice cream.  I made the mistake of assuming the chocolate was in a relationship with the ice cream and they would stick together but no....They ve consulted lawyers and started seeing other people. The chocolate in particular has already started a complicated affair with my white leather sofa and my new jeans.  The ice cream got to keep the stick. So.....taste wise they re great.  But you need to try to work out how to get the two parts to work together. Meanwhile I m going to see if I can invest in one of those bibs with a scoop tray on the bottom so I don t lose half my lolly!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13244749_10153831895733019_6426555640189060302_n.jpg?oh=0aa697b4f958b3f2a4f159aea4a1dd8f&oe=590ECF18	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13244749_10153831895733019_6426555640189060302_n.jpg?oh=122a866e5e409b504275c4e83ac20dda&oe=591F0515	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153831895733019&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-23T20:42:22+0000	1464036142	2016-05-23 22:42:22	22	22	28	5	55	21	6	15	53	0	21	0	0	6	0	0	0

You wait to receive an email right?  Wrong  they call the house where the cake is being delivered to and spoil the surprise.  So you message their online helpdesk to be told  Sorry  but we don t send out emails for this  but we would contact you from call. This has been fed back  so the website can be updated as soon as possible .  Too late for my purchase  so thanks Tesco that s amazing customer service!

Always got extra vouchers for money off or extra points every quarter  but since my shopping bill has reduced due to circumstances outside my control - Tesco have seemed to decide I m not worthy of any extra vouchers or points!!!  Maybe this is another way of cost cutting to make back the loss of profits they have had.  It is certainly not making me want to shop there at all.  Much better quality food and far better deals with Mark & Spencers and the Sparks card.  A very disillusioned customer.

I received these onions on Wednesday evening with my grocery order and popped them in my veg cupboard. I took them out today for the first time and every one of them is mouldy. The use by date is today but they shouldn t go mushy straight away. The cupboard is cool  dry and dark which is why I use it for veggies.

You must have about a hundred different varieties of milk in your very large (Dundrum) store.  So  why is it that the iconic size of the Ireland s largest milk brand i.e Avonmore Full Fat 1 litre tetra pack has been de-listed by Tesco head office?????? I m finding it way too time consuming to have to go to SuperValu or Spar as well.  Please tell me you just made a mistake... and it wasn t actually a decision! Or do I have to switch my weekly shop to elsewhere?					2016-05-23T15:33:51+0000	1464017631	2016-05-23 17:33:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had queued at a checkout to pay for our shopping but to also to put on this weeks lottery numbers. When we presented   our quick pay lottery card the checkout assistant politely explained that her till didnt  do  the lottery and thatonly some off them do  no  problem really  just meant another short queue at customer service desk and it was done. The suggestion is why not have a sign at the checkout that justs says Sorry lottery no available  at this till. It would maybe save someones  time  customer or customer service desk assistant.

I have to say the customer service was amazing. Ian was really helpful and talked me through how to use the phone (I ve been an iPhone user for too long!). I was there for nearly an hour and not once did I feel like I was a burden or taking too long.

I have been a regular shopper for a very long time and wanted to see if you would be interested in  giving back  to the local community. After numerous visits to the store and a trip with the school in which I work to go  behind the scenes  I see a lot of promotion of the community champion and the great work They do locally. However I am now raising money for a little girl in my family with a rare and severe disorder to fund private treatment that could enable her to walk and to donate to the charity reverse rett. I have tried to contact the community champion via email more than once  been in store and spoken to people who would  pass my details on  and also spoke to someone on the helpline who spoke with the store manager who took my number off of them and assured them they would call me  right away . Needless to say I still haven t been contacted by anyone and the event is fast approaching. Even if no help could be offered a simply response would have been great. I am not putting the blame on the champion  as I was told they were only allocated certain hours to work in that area. It s just a shame that you promote  getting involved in the community  but yet it s impossible for a local person to get in contact.

Yesterday I placed an order with TESCO Direct and used my clubcard vouchers to pay for my order. Within minutes of confirming my order I discovered that they actually had a better offer on similar products so I cancelled my order immediately so I could get the better deal.  I have learnt today that my clubcard vouchers are now no longer valid and lost as I cancelled my order and they will not be refunded  they will be refunded in points and added to my next statement - so I now have no vouchers to get the better deal. Oh and this is the final time for clubcard boost.  I spoke to TESCO Customer Services who were very unhelpful and basically said  they re the rules   come on TESCO you have an extremely fed up customer here who spends most of her earnings in your store and yes  every little helps . Surely vouchers can be added back to my account with the click of a button????

Was talking to the Butcher to say how nice the piece of Brisket of Beef was only to be told that they are discontinuing it. Why???  We are always being urged to use the cheaper cuts a  because it is cheaper and b  because it has a better flavour. There is nothing like a slowed cooked Brisket joint that we often have. I can see us taking a trip elsewhere to buy what WE want not what you want to sell us.  This is not the first thing we have been unable to buy lately and have a fortnight lay trip to Asda in Clevedon where we can get what WE want.					2016-05-23T11:37:56+0000	1464003476	2016-05-23 13:37:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I then discovered that I would have to pay ¬£2 to have it delivered to store as the total order was less than ¬£30? Pathetic! Are your profit margins not high enough?? Your customers are now being exploited with ridiculous charges like that! Any way I never ordered it out of principle  I took my money elsewhere! And today to add insult to injury I went to your Burnley store as I need a Belle dress for my daughters birthday party. They didn t have one in store so I was told to buy one on-line and I would be able to double up my current club card vouchers as I could in store. After speaking to someone on the phone it has been made clear that I cannot do this as for some reason it won t allow it! I don t think I will be visiting Tesco in store or on-line again. I will also be closing down my club card and cancelling my car insurance when I am out of contract! I have never been so appalled at a company in my life! Every little helps? Yes  every little penny you can get will help to improve your profit margins! I ll stick to Asda and Sainsburys from now on!					2016-05-23T10:54:50+0000	1464000890	2016-05-23 12:54:50	2	6	2	0	8	4	3	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I moaned on here a couple of weeks ago about telling a store manager and filling in an online survey about a wonderful person in one of your stores yet said person was never told of my compliments about him.  You promised me faithfully that you would deal with it and yes you were as good as your word. I saw the person this morning in store and management really made amends.  They put what I d said about him in writing for him to keep. He was so happy to have received the letter and just proves that a few kind words can really make someone s day. So thank you to all the Tesco FB team for sorting it all out. Much appreciated.					2016-05-23T09:53:47+0000	1463997227	2016-05-23 11:53:47	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They are always brilliant!! However Tesco you as a store fell a tad short this week. I have been charged for 2 baking soda but only got one and no breakdown of offers on my shopping bill just you have saved this much. I just like to check that you have given me all you promised and as two of the offer items were for someone else it was a bit of a faff sorting it out :-(					2016-05-23T08:45:07+0000	1463993107	2016-05-23 10:45:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Poured them into a bowl ready to have some breakfast except what followed the flakes was a string of red hair (my own hair is jet black) so question is what on earth is a piece of hair doing in my cereal box? Am grossed out. I have kept the hair in a bit of kitchen roll. I do have the reciept and will return it to store I purchased from tomorrow. Apart from getting a refund would I further be compensated? Abit peeved as I was looking forward to breakfast and it s pretty rank a hair landed in my cereal. üò≥ Surely this isn t acceptable.					2016-05-22T19:25:26+0000	1463945126	2016-05-22 21:25:26	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have gotten to know my delivery drivers and manager from the Aberdare branch  quite well  as I have my tesco shopping delivered each week and they are all so kind courteous and will go out of their way to ensure that everything is ok for me.  And they are extremely helpful . but I hadn t t realised what a bunch of caring  kind  lovely  thoughtful people they really are to think so much of myself and the loss of my son  to go out of their way and present me with these beautiful flowers . I thank you all at Aberdare Tesco for your kindness  care and thoughtfulness .You have brought me comfort from your kindness  although I was in tears while having the flowers handed to me . Thank  you from the bottom of my heart for thinking of me and my son .I knew you were a bunch of special people  Thank you .

Although the customer service assistant was helpful  I am appalled to find out that Tesco does not recognise a double barrelled surname! Apparently  I have to choose one name in order to be able to log in. A double barrelled surname is not a  pick and choose   it s part of my identity.

A little disappointed when I went into store today to find you ve discontinued your frozen avocado halves? Are you able to tell me if they will be back? The store assistant i spoke to said they had been very popular and countless people had been asking for them since they had been discontinued!

I have an autistic son who I never take shopping with me  as far too hard work. but on this one time today I took him to tesco with me  we saw this and he picked an orange  we peeled it and put the peel in the bin provided next to it  he ate segments round the shop while I was shopping  obviously he was still difficult  but so much easier than normal.  He did go back for another piece  a banana this time which he ate while we finished the rest of the shopping. So it actually worked  I thank you so much for this idea  it really did work.

I was using a self-scan checkout to buy a drink  the machine would not register my money (despite putting money in)  staff did nothing to help but eventually insisted that I PAY EXTRA money with my remaining change.   Therefore  it was either I pay more than the actual price of the drink or be accused of trying to shoplift all because of a robbing self-scan machine.

We went to the till to pay and I was absolutely disgusted when the cashier and another member of staff stated we can t buy that item as its not showing on the system so they can t sell it  now my 1 year old was devastated when she realised we haven t got it  seeing as it was taken off us at the till  why would you leave things on the shelves if your not selling them? That s ridiculous  it was supposed to be a nice day out to treat the little ones  it ended in tears  I guess we wont be shopping there again.					2016-05-22T12:25:34+0000	1463919934	2016-05-22 14:25:34	1	1	1	1	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why do you have a special offer on all kinds of 500ml Sugary Coca Cola drinks (2 for ¬£2) I believe... But Diet Coke is not included?? I spend hundreds of pounds on Diet Coke in your store every year... It s not like it s some kind of rare purchase but it s not the first time I ve noticed it. Shouldn t you be doing everything you can to convince us you promote a healthy life style? Today you just failed. I don t want sugary pop... I just want to not pay more for my healthier choices :( :( :(					2016-05-22T11:54:37+0000	1463918077	2016-05-22 13:54:37	1	12	1	0	13	12	10	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Spent ¬£350 on a television and the man serving was fantastic BUT got home and tv was smashed. Took it back the man again was apologetic and a refund was then going to be given as no other was in stock. This is where the joke began 40 minutes yes 40 minutes for someone to sort out a refund. 40 minutes for someone to walk a few yards from an office to deal with a customer who has already had a bad experience. 40 minutes!!!!!!!! How can it be so hard to do a refund? To keep a customer waiting that long.					2016-05-22T11:11:29+0000	1463915489	2016-05-22 13:11:29	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a play with yourselves for car insurance.  The policy is up today (but I didn t receive a renewal quote until Friday 20th!).  I ve decided to go with a cheaper quote and already taken that out.  The issue is  I keep ringing tesco car insurance on 0345 671 5678 and 0345 673 000 to cancel the policy.  But after being on hold for around 10 minutes each time  the line disconnects!  I am furious!  I understand you may be busy  but this is totally unacceptable and to be honest makes me glad I have decided to go elsewhere for cover.  Can someone please get back to me asap.  I am  not going to be happy if money is taken out of my account.					2016-05-22T11:02:49+0000	1463914969	2016-05-22 13:02:49	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Usually I order from a different chain of stores (who had always supplied exactly what I ve ordered  incidentally) but thought I d give you a try... So I ordered 3 weeks ago. Sandwich platters and things  for my beautiful little girls 5th birthday party. I ve invited 40 children  so I ordered lots of platters of sandwiches and rolls. Plenty of notice I presumed  for collection between 10-12 today- her party starts at 1pm. My husband gets there to collect (his only job tbh  I figured he couldn t get it wrong) and the man very politely informs him that there s been some substitutions on my order... That s right. Substitutions on an order that I finalised weeks ago- knowing that they d be specially ordered in and that there was a 3 days order time on them.   Now I m left having to take substitutions I didn t want because I don t have any choice  and I ve got to somehow make enough sandwiches for the children that are coming to her party!  Absolutely ridiculous that no one thought to let me know before hand that you couldn t  provide what I d ordered so I had a chance to find what I needed somewhere else! That s why I have a mobile number on my account.   Safe to say I ll stick to my preferred shop for these things from now on!					2016-05-22T10:24:58+0000	1463912698	2016-05-22 12:24:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They were dated best before 25th May & all three packets were mouldy on Wednesday 18th May. After contacting yourselves you thought a ¬£3 refund was adequate...I m yet to receive this. So giving tesco another chance on Friday 20th May I did another weeks shopping. During a family picnic yesterday my son noticed the fruit drink went out of date in April . I really have lost all faith in Tesco.

I could not drive forward as the light was on red and did not want to risk my car being damaged  I rang the main tesco line which the girl said was cardiff and then asked for someone from the Wrexham garage to come out and assist as I  was stuck and had an angry customer behind me! eventually the lady came out  she said the car wash was on a code 33  was broke and they were having a new car wash in June  she returned in the garage to get a refund but came out with another token  she did something in the wall with a key and the machine started up she then gave me a return wash for the carwash ...however  the car was filthy after I had gone through the wash so i drove to customer service to explain all this again  and asked for a refund  and explained the free return wash was no good as the machine was broke and didn t wash the car properly  the lady told me to shop then return to customer services  on doing this I was given a ¬£5 gift card?! less than what  I had paid out.. and no cash refund? By this point I was totally fed up so didn t argue! but on going to use the card it hadn t even been activated!! so I ve lost out on my money and had a great deal of hassle!!					2016-05-22T04:45:47+0000	1463892347	2016-05-22 06:45:47	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

During this time it was very cold  blizzard like outside so was an unusually long journey. We were thankful you were open as our regular  Asda  was closed until the morning.  As we arrived at tesco we were greated by a very polite security guard. Walking down the Isles I decided it was the sweets I craved and wanted to fulfil this empty space with what is call  mega mouth spray .  I jumped for joy when the excitement of seeing it on your shelf.  I grabbed with all my strength and we made our way to the til area.. Self service to be exact. I scanned my items  paid  collected my receip and off we went to the car for your yet long blizzard like journey home. As my employer was driving  I decided to open my  mega mouth spray  and spray the first spray...  To my discovery I realised nothing was coming out.. I looks again and checked and to my discovery I found this was empty. This had caused me much upset and emotional pain. When I further looked into why this may be the case  I discovered it had a crack in the bottom and this was result in my empty sweet. I ve now had to result in going to bed with an empty space  knowing the struggle of sleeping tonight.  I hope you are well aware of the issue this has now caused me and disappointment of now ever shopping at tesco.  Please can you advise me on the next step to take this investigation further.

You have been providing a uniform service to my childrens school for a few years now but this years order and delivery has been well below expectation. Having waited to place my order for the final clubcard double up   I find its no longer available on F+F online (where you have transferred the uniform service) I then place my order to find the size needed is out if stock (how difficult is it for a school uniform supplier to keep stock of navy sweatshirts?). Finally   when the order I did place finally arrived  the quality of sweatshirts is shockingly poor. They are  to be frank  think cheap and nasty and the size of the pe shirt is completely disproportionate. Sort it out Tesco. You have a monopoly here and its not up to standard.					2016-05-21T22:56:22+0000	1463871382	2016-05-22 00:56:22	2	7	2	0	9	7	4	3	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

When tucking into her beef and dumpling stew ready meal on the evening  she was surprised to find a piece of glass that she had put in her mouth. This is totally unacceptable and negligent  and we still have the glass if you would like photos of proof. Needless to say she s wary about buying any future ready meals from your store.

Realistically  it s not that hard to do but when you have to do it before eating anything it s a real inconvenience. Hardly any of your food items have the total amount of carbs displayed in the nutrition and it is even worse when something is a part of a multipack and doesn t have full nutrition information on it. Please consider changing your packaging and it would make mine and probably so many other type 1 diabetic customers lives a lot easier  as we could actually eat our food straight away without having to faff about with carb counting!!					2016-05-21T20:34:03+0000	1463862843	2016-05-21 22:34:03	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This week I have tried your chocolate desserts for lunch. We have also bought your free from strawberry ice cream cones which are amazing!! They taste so creamy and full of flavour with a lovely crisp cone  just the perfect treat. I would love it if you would do the mint version even more. My husband doesn t have to eat free from products  but he chooses your onion rings because they are crispier and taste nicer than all other brands.

Served by a young lady today who wasn t welcoming at all  pretty much chucking my shopping as she scanned it through and was more interested in her colleague conversation behind me! The worst thing was all of this didn t even bother me until my child decided to move the shopping dividers and the young girl at the till snatched it back. Absolutely fuming!!!!! You do not want staff like this working in your store who can t handle children or lack in people skills!					2016-05-21T17:56:30+0000	1463853390	2016-05-21 19:56:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have recently broken my ankle so cannot get out to do my shopping so am relying on the delivery service. However the last 3-4 weeks I have been less and less impressed. And this week was a real disappointment as nearly all of my fresh stuff and bread is all out of date today or tomorrow which I don t find acceptable as it was delivered yesterday!!! I have today thrown a load of stuff out as it was not fit to eat!!! My weekly shop varies from ¬£100-¬£150 per week and 80% of this is fresh produce that we are unable to use the last few weeks!!! I thought it was policy to inform customers of stuff with short life!!! I m a very unhappy customer and after 10 years of shopping at tesco every week am doubtful I will be using the service next week!!!					2016-05-21T17:35:34+0000	1463852134	2016-05-21 19:35:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Cant find one so I am posting it here. I purchased a box of 6 Tesco British Free Range Eggs with a display until date of 26 May and a best before 2 of June so well in date.  I have eaten eggs all my life  kept chickens and brought super market eggs.  These really are disappointing  I scrambled them. Pale and insipid looking  no flavour at all and certainly not what you would expect of a free range egg.  I wonder what these chickens are fed!  I nearly tipped them in the bin I was so disgusted I checked the date on the box twice.  I would not recommend this product.					2016-05-21T17:25:12+0000	1463851512	2016-05-21 19:25:12	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I posted this on the Chokablok page and never got a reply so posting it here. Ps I m not the only one with this problem   For Easter I had one request from the Easter bunny - a giant Eton Mess egg.  My easter bunny had to go to 5 different shops to find one and even then had to beg for it lol.  Needless to say he was in my good books :) went to finally eat it tonight and found this.  My egg is mouldy and the mould appears to be eating away at the chocolate.  Best before is end of May so should have been fine.

Thing is anyone would be hard pushed to see why these were imperfect. You are really missing the point. You say these vegetables are just as tasty  which of course they are  so why not just put ALL the vegetables in a bag without grading between what you consider  perfect  and  imperfect . To sort vegetables to some grading system of your choosing costs the packer time  be that the grower or a packing plant. If they are all  just as tasty  why grade them at all? We don t need a choice of differently graded vegetables we just need the vegetables.					2016-05-21T16:49:07+0000	1463849347	2016-05-21 18:49:07	0	9	0	0	9	9	1	8	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I made them aware of the five Devon stores who have introduced the practice of placing pint cartons of milk with other drinks next to sandwiches  regarding which an article had been written in this week s Farmers Weekly. This had proved such a success that consideration was being given to rolling this out nationally.   The store is one of the main choices of lunch for children from the local High School  and they were willing to listen to my comments regarding the fact that children would be more likely to drink milk that was easily accessible. Also  with milk being one of the only two safe drinks for teeth  ideal for if to be offered in this manner.  Thank you Tesco....look forward to seeing this in store....and possibly considered elsewhere?  #milkandsarnies					2016-05-21T15:45:35+0000	1463845535	2016-05-21 17:45:35	2	1	3	1	5	1	1	0	1	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

I use your newtownabbey store regularly. could you please invest in a few more of those wee car/trolleys as you only have two there. Last week my wife and 2 year old daughter went shopping  the two car/trolleys were in use. We told our daughter who was not amused that we were going for a coffee 1st anyway and hopefully there would be one available by the time we had finished.  5 mins later we sat down with with our coffee and at that moment I spotted the car/trolley emerging from a checkout. I can see one  ill go and get it I said to my daughter (daddy the hero).  I could see there was a young lady who had two kids with her  I didn t want to rush her so instead of asking could I have it after her I thought I would wait until she had discarded it. I then found myself stalking this young lady from checkout to car. As she passed me at the main door I didn t make eye contact instead I pretended to be on the phone.I looked over at my daughter who was waiting for her daddy to return and I thought   what if another dad was watching and waiting  I had to get closer.  So after a few james bond like car park menouvers I found myself casually walking by as the young lady placed the last bag of shopping in the boot.   could I have that  I asked in calm and collected manner.  Yes sure she replied  oblivious to the mission that I had just completed in the lead up to this question.  As I pushed the trolley through the main entrance I could almost hear the whole store and my daughter cheer me as if I had saved Christmas.  Of course there was no cheering but a huge smile from my daughter was thanks enough.  Anyway back to the point   as I fear one day even my james bond manoeuvres may not be enough to ensure a pleasent shopping trip. Please invest in a few more car/trolleys as 2 is not enough.

I didn t do this for a while because I found the wait  while the bottle was retrieved  a bit off-putting. Perhaps a few people did  because the bottles are back in the boxes these days. Due to an oversight  for which I blame nobody (for we are fallible  and to err is human  to forgive divine)  the security tag was not removed from my Dalwhinnie  so the alarm sounded as I left the shop. I returned to the store  receipt in hand  and went to Customer services. Unfortunately  I was not able to attract anyone s attention. Had I the patience of Job  and no son to pick up in three minutes  time  I should have waited until all customers were served  all cigarette packets straightened and all watches checked. As it was  I stood in the barriers  waving my arms and calling  Hello?  hello? Can anyone help me?  as the alarm sounded. Answer came there none  so I gave up and left  the cacophony receding as I strolled into the car park. This is the second time this has happened - the first instance playing out identically to today s. I shall decant the spirit so that I don t feel like a criminal when pouring a dram  and return the empty bottle  with tag  next week. No harm has been done  but I feel that if nobody is too concerned about the alarm sounding  could we just do away with the tags  sensors and barriers  and save a bit of time and money?					2016-05-21T12:29:41+0000	1463833781	2016-05-21 14:29:41	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The examples I gave were Aubergines ( not available to order online for ages) & Onion Bhajis  again not available to buy on line but sent to me as a sub for the naan bread i had ordered.  Is there a reason for the reduced choice? I would have thought both fairly basic items?

I went to the Ammanford store specifically to buy a packet of Kellogg s Ancient Grain cereal  a product I have purchased from here on numerous occasions. The shelves were full to brimming. Yum  yum  methinks. But it was not to be because apparently  the computer said no . After a very long wait at the till for someone to be called over  I finally gave up the will to live  as did everyone else in the queue; life is too short to be standing at a checkout. It was only after I had already paid and was leaving with a rumbling stomach that someone turned up to deal with the problem. To add insult to injury  he stood there clutching the packet to his chest as if I was going to grab it from it and make a run for it. I must say this crossed my mind  but by now I was too weak with hunger to have made the exit. If this product is not on your system  why bother to have shelves stacked with it? I am fed up with incidents like this (I also had one last week) so I ve gone from being a loyal Tesco shopper to one who now only comes in to buy something I can t get elsewhere first.

You would probably find that you would also benefit as your own customers cant even park.  Cant see why they cant do what everyone else does in village  park further up the road so everyone can benefit with custom. Not all of us our on a hourly wage and if I cant earn a wage from my shop maybe you can explain to my 5 year old why she cant have her gymnastic lessons anymore.					2016-05-21T08:31:23+0000	1463819483	2016-05-21 10:31:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is quite expensive at ¬£2.49  so I really appreciate it when it is reduced to ¬£1.99  every now and then. What I don t appeciate is going into the store just a couple of days after the promotion has started  to get my weekly shopping to discover that the coconut milk has sold out and won t be back in store for almost 3 weeks. So not only do I miss out on buying it at the reduced price but I actually have to go without it at all  unless I go to Sainsbury s :-(					2016-05-21T08:17:58+0000	1463818678	2016-05-21 10:17:58	0	7	0	1	8	7	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just a thought but maybe you need to employ more than one security man ü§î  It s not the first time I have gone to this store on a Friday at around 19.00hrs. after work and been subjected to hassle  noise & grief from young people in & around the store...  They are in & out of the store  up & down the  Travelator   hanging around the covered car park and tonight in particular running up & down the front of the store  the covered car park consistently has young drivers revving their engines  driving  recklessly  up and down the car park aisles  music so loud that everybody has to listen whether we like it or not! There are times - like tonight when I had to watch them manoeuvring around the car park - albeit slowly  to the annoyance of a customer just driving in to the car park!  I have been sat waiting for my cab on several occasions and seen the Security man attempt to move the groups of young people standing about & the ones who just sit in their cars  revving their engines & subjecting us all to their  tunes ... The young people just laugh and taunt him  what can he do?  There are A4 laminated signs dotted about stating that Tesco will not tolerate loitering by young people as it affects customers and the local Police will take action ( words to that effect)  Well Tesco the local Police do not take action  I know this because tonight I had to wait 40 minutes for a cab and unfortunately had the time to be subjected to all that I have stated previously!  I sit on the train from work and dread walking in & out of your Hednesford store  it is a horrendous experience!!!  It s about time this issue - which you are obviously aware of is addressed?  Apparently  every little counts...   Let s see Tesco  let s see					2016-05-20T23:44:52+0000	1463787892	2016-05-21 01:44:52	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For the past 2 nights I have had the most rude  ill-mannered staff - (stocking) who begin at 10:40pm - and every isle is unshoppable for 20 minutes until advertised closure at 11pm. How can anyone shop when you have every isle full of stocking carts 20 minutes before its due to close. This is worsened by a request to one of the staff to move a cart in order to reach an item and be told this isle is closed!! It doesn t make sense to me. Why employ your till staff till 11pm when you cannot actually shop in the store for 20 minutes before closure. Much more was actually exchanged between myself and the staff member at Tesco stocking - Due to his poor attitude. It truly pi**ed me off.					2016-05-20T22:06:39+0000	1463781999	2016-05-21 00:06:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And with the whimsical tiger design  I was surely onto a winner. Imagine my dismay when I cracked it open and tried it out....the sequence of notes on this xylophone is:  D  F  G#  G  E flat  What an odd progression of notes! It s like a Syd Barrett melody.

We place our first ever home delivery order which arrived last night  in allotted time slot  but the ice lollies we ordered had completely defrosted.  I called the helpline and they refunded me  which is expected and I was satisfied that I had not paid for defective item.   However  after a lovely call from the branch today  I was really surprised when this evening a lovely driver delivered me the ice lollies we were missing.    My daughter who is studying hard for exams and had been looking forward to a Friday treat did not miss out!

The sales assistant saying to her    I can t help you GO AWAY    after the lady walked away from phone section I was very concerned. I took it upon myself to follow the lady and approached her to see if she was Ok . She mentioned the disrespectful way that Judith had spoken to her when asking for help. It appears the elderly lady was asking for help for due to being hospitalized for 11 Months and not being able to use Tesco Mobile Network because there was never no signal to make important phone calls. This is totally unacceptable for one of your staff to be talking to customers let alone Elderly vulnerable people. I know others that have received the very arrogant   Unhelpful manner this Sales Assistant ( Judith ) has   I would like this followed up please and feedback received   Totally Unacceptable on your employees !!					2016-05-20T18:33:24+0000	1463769204	2016-05-20 20:33:24	0	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Not a big problem for most  but I have an autistic son who only eats 4/5 different things as it is & he ll only eat one brand of bread! A chap was unloading bread & heard me freaking out to my mum  he kindly went out of his way to ask what brand it was & told me he knew there was a delivery outback that hadn t yet been unloaded. He promptly went off & found it for me & came back & searched for us while we shopped. This might not be a big deal to some  but for my son & our family this meant a lot. I didn t get his name but it was around 11am today. I can t thank him enough :) :)					2016-05-20T17:49:13+0000	1463766553	2016-05-20 19:49:13	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wondering if you could investigate this products packaging (Tesco Still Lemonade)  I don t see the point in having a bottle that can be recycled and then covering it in a label that can t. Can the label not be made to be recycled or even just print directly onto the bottle.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13244730_10206658246007377_1357280314924566493_n.jpg?oh=180096f1ddaeb94422b158ade6413ba4&oe=59243518	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13244730_10206658246007377_1357280314924566493_n.jpg?oh=ee9a1c23a758cf5cebabfcf2d7bfbc95&oe=591CD115	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206658246007377&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-20T16:52:15+0000	1463763135	2016-05-20 18:52:15	0	3	0	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was shopping about 9am  with my very happy and chatty 18 month old little boy when two members of staff breezed passed  one said in a mardy and sarcastic tone  Ohhh be quiet!  towards my boy. Clearly  it was aimed at us as there was no one else around and my little boy  although chatting noisily was perfectly happy. After 2 mins  I did go to try to find the names of the staff member but had little success  unfortunately.					2016-05-20T16:38:07+0000	1463762287	2016-05-20 18:38:07	0	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

I had popped in with my two children after collecting the youngest from nursery.  We were sat in the cafe  when suddenly my 2 year old starting having the tantrum from hell. I couldn t quite believe it.  Everyone literally was staring and I felt so bad for your other customers as nothing was working.  I had to get him into the trolley (as he was sat in a high chair). He was stiffening up his body and kicking out. One employee who was on a break in the cafe came over to offer to help me keep the trolley still  as it was moving everywhere with no joy of getting him in. A big thank you number one. Then when he was blowing the roof off with his tantrum  your cafe manager came over with a packet of chocolate biscuits for him. Even though at that moment he was having none of it  it did eventually help. A big thank you number 2. Then the lovely lady who served us at the cafe came over with some pieces of baby and some colouring crayons. A big thank you number 3. I actually felt like crying  out of thanks to your staff for being so kind and trying to calm my little boy down. It was really appreciated. I hope this message gets to your Stretford store. As I would love them to know that the acts of kindness they offered (no matter how small) it really made a huge impact.

I was looking at the mince (the Mrs has requested a Spag Bol and what she says goes) and noticed a few differences in price. I wanted low fat as I m a bit of a chubber and need to lose a bit off the love handles. I was a bit surprised to discover that buying 5% fat mince costs me double the price (per kg) that 18% mince does. I know sod all about how the meat is processed/ packaged etc so not sure on the cost involved in producing it. However  we are bombarded daily with news of the obesity crisis  we re being told a sugar tax will be placed on soft drinks  yet we re charged more for wanting to eat a more healthy meat? I m sure this isn t just a tesco issue but it was your store I noticed this in. What exactly is the difference in the meat (other than the fat content and location it s from)??  I ve attached a photo for reference.

I wanted to comment on your very lovely security officer who I watched kindly helping this lady to complete her shopping list. He was charming  not just helping her to look for the items she wanted but making sure she didn t miss an offer either and having a chat with her too. It is how I would want to be treated if I needed help. He is a credit to you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13266042_10153726800229007_4231833980441132839_n.jpg?oh=2294672c2c5041f2bfa1146b1f355d52&oe=5922AD81	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13266042_10153726800229007_4231833980441132839_n.jpg?oh=eca68ab7609cf465c0fab667df9168ca&oe=591AC08C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153726800229007&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-20T13:57:00+0000	1463752620	2016-05-20 15:57:00	7061	243	7376	550	8169	242	138	104	1099	0	6963	295	10	2	0	0	0

When I looked up Boswell farms it came up with a bed and breakfast.  Why are you advertising something that doesn t exist? What are you trying to hide in our food?  I had no choice the other week to buy a Boswell farm mince meet.  Let me say it tastes and looks awful  never a better reason to support a local butcher that knows where the cattle was bred  raised and slaughtered.					2016-05-20T13:06:35+0000	1463749595	2016-05-20 15:06:35	1	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

I paid for delivery and therefore expect a complete home service.  I attach more photos - perhaps you d like to send one of your drivers to pick it up so the hair can be forensically tested to ensure it is indeed a foreign body.  Perhaps you d also like to address the issue of it being stashed amongst my food items - clearly a breach of food hygiene regs.  You know I d have accepted a driver coming with a new brush to replace the used one - but having still not received a phone call or explanation or even a half decent apology the very least you can now do is refund the items in the shopping trolley the used brush travelled around with when your picker picked my shopping.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13267919_10154242903988573_5805392784881927175_n.jpg?oh=be61d1dd3e9048ddec9c2fcea6d57519&oe=58D8C830	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13267919_10154242903988573_5805392784881927175_n.jpg?oh=9bbbef5817d68072fdd4ba39f5a8519b&oe=58D9C63D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154242903988573&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-20T12:17:06+0000	1463746626	2016-05-20 14:17:06	2	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received my letter through the post weeks ago and waited patiently for the  last ever  clubcard boost. Been saving my vouchers and was really pleased to learn that my chosen item was included in the boost. So at 8am on Monday I logged into my account on put my chosen item in my basket - A Dyson V8 Animal Cordless. The price had mysteriously been  boosted  too but I didn t mind too much because I was using vouchers. Unfortunately once the item was in my basket I got a notice to say that the item was no longer in stock and I could  save  it for later. I tried the V8 Absolute as an alternate but got the same result. So today I thought I d check to see if the product was back in stock. It s there  reduced by ¬£70 back to the pre-boost price and it s been taken off the offer. How can you do this? It s not even been a week. Does anyone actually get to buy these items or do you falsely advertise popular items  then pretend they re out of stock so that you don t actually have to honour the promotion. I have read the T&C s and I understand that Tesco reserves the right to withdraw items  but at least sell some first. Or hold enough stock volume to cover the first day of the promotion. What am I saying! YOU DO HAVE STOCK! You re just a bunch of con artists. Please remember that I did have to buy from Tesco over a prolonged period in order to collect these vouchers. What a way to thank your customers for their loyalty! #irked					2016-05-20T11:38:35+0000	1463744315	2016-05-20 13:38:35	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wanted to buy some Tesco dairy-free spread  but all of your own products contain Palm Oil  and there is nothing to say that this oil is responsibly sourced (RSPO).  Obviously a lot of people buying free-from items have allergies and intolerances and may not care about the environment  but many of us really do.  I don t want to eat irresponsibly-sourced palm oil - one of the biggest eco-disasters currently happening in the world. If you are going to use this oil in your products  please can you switch to RSPO?  A huge retailer like Tesco has massive purchasing power.

I usually buy around 10 packs at a time  then wash and freeze them to later add to our breakfast every morning. I have been trying to get some for a few weeks now  but they never seem to be in stock lately. Although I usually buy them from Tesco  in my despiration I also checked Ocado and Waitrose  and they don t have any either. The shelves are over-full with non-organic raspberries  but I would rather go without than buy these. I know that most people who want organic might just buy the non-organic ones  but doing this might make major retailers believe there is no demand for organic. If there is a shortage  this would tend to suggest that your growers are growing way too many non-organic raspberries (a large percentage of which will have to be sold at a reduced price)  and nowhere near enough organic to cope with demand.					2016-05-20T07:14:29+0000	1463728469	2016-05-20 09:14:29	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unprofessional and absolutely ridiculous behavior! I m not supposed to have to defend my own body while I m food shopping  get your staff sorted out. Your staff stared at me and laughed.  One dude even looked at me with disgust!  Then we went to the till and a couple stared at me on and off and you can both hear and see that they talked about me. It wasen t discrete and a lot of people spotted it but no one did anything  especially none of your staff.   I m not supposed to have to defend my own body in your shops  absolutely ridiculous.   Your staff have got no right to treat me like trash  they got no right to stare and laugh at me  they got no right to force my body into a corner where I m only allowed to wear loose clothing.    Me and my flatmate are loyal customers but after yesterday we might take our business elsewhere unless I get a formal apology.					2016-05-20T06:15:02+0000	1463724902	2016-05-20 08:15:02	7	2	8	2	12	2	1	1	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	1	0

I recently purchased a deal which you offer  and as part of this you include the option of picking a side  now i m assuming this deal is one which two people are supposed to share given that you state on the packaging of one product  pack contains two servings . However this has derailed my relationship  naturally as the person who has cooked and purchased the meal  should a lady and tramp situation arise over a final meatball  then the lady should accept defeat and allow me to consume the final meatball given my purchase and cooking  however in this situation I found myself with a side of 3 chicken wings (see attached photos). Now whilst it may be romantic to share  spag bol  (not for me personally as i m not into that and frankly I find it repulsive anywhoo back on track) sharing a chicken wing is neither sexy nor hygienic  so imagine the peril which arose when I presented the 3 chicken wings which you provided me with. I m in a situation with someone I m not too familiar with  someone who whilst I m looking to impress  I may not see any longevity in the relationship  therefore at the very least I should consume half the chicken wings  yet i m lost  do I eat two thirds of the portion  do i eat some of the second chicken wing or do I offer the whole second chicken wing. Gosh darn it  if I offer the second chicken wing then I am setting up myself for a lifetime of defeat anytime a situation arises I ll be known as the one who bowed to the chicken wing  i ll have no standing in any future arguments  if i ll give in to a chicken wing then when it comes to important decisions like a house or a car  then how can I be trusted  if I can t show authority on a chicken wing then how am I hypothetically able to put my foot down on important discussions like the name of a child  the family holiday or the tone of the doorbell? Don t get me wrong Mr or Mrs Tesco  I can quite easily consume that share portion of 3 chicken wings to myself  however unfortunately  as the name suggests it is a share portion  if two chicken wings were provided I may have been in for a somewhat less lonesome night  however as an odd number of wings were provided I find myself typing away to an entity  as mentioned previously  I cannot succumb to donating a greater share of the portion for the aforementioned reasons  yet if I do succumb  I find myself living a life of resentment  I ask of you this  could you please offer these chicken wings in a serving of 4 so that I am able to form a relationship without basing it on an argument over chicken wings. Sincerely  Daniel.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13245222_10156777375385391_2608331515204520881_n.jpg?oh=68f8da95300eedca9130f2dc68ad033d&oe=591E26AC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13245222_10156777375385391_2608331515204520881_n.jpg?oh=7cfeb2f9df04c24248e2684a4279cce1&oe=5920DCA1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156777375385391&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-20T00:17:24+0000	1463703444	2016-05-20 02:17:24	54	17	62	1	80	17	2	15	6	0	53	1	0	7	0	0	0

I was told theyve a right to do this at anytime without warning. Why wasnt I told at the door that ide been overcharged by ¬£14?  I was told by the driver that all my order was correct and no substitutes had been sent. It was two hours later that I realised cash was missing out of the charity funds.

Despite the box being obviously mishandled at some point the damage was more than likely done before it was packaged at the factory.  I phoned up hoping to arrange an exchange for a different model only to be told this was not possible due to the item being purchased on the Boost with Clubcard vouchers.  All they could offer me was a straight swap for the same model or vouchers re-issued via post.  Is this my only option? The reason I ask is the person on the Phone did not sound too sure himself and given the option I would much prefer a different model due to the issues I had with the first.  Many Thanks.					2016-05-19T18:57:41+0000	1463684261	2016-05-19 20:57:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

(One big enough to wear proper baby clothes) so Imagine the complete devastation that we  as parents  felt when we discovered that the new  baby  was broken. She didn t make any noises or blink or do anything it said on the box! We couldn t take it back off her and exchange it for one that wasn t broken because she was besotted with it and took it upon herself to tuck her into bed with her and fall asleep  arms wrapped so tight around the  baby  that we didn t stand a chance of even getting close before having a full on emotional breakdown from our little princess.

She was putting the shopping away & the 2Litre semi-skimmed milk bottle litterally exploded all over her newly laid kitchen floor. On inspection of the bottle it looks like it could have been tampered with & deliberately cut so that the only outcome was that the bottle would burst. 2 Litres of milk all over her floor. She has had to throw away her rug as there is no way the smell of rotten milk is going to come of a good wool rug. The kitchen is going to stink of rotten milk as it went under her appliances. This is hardly the type of customer experience anyone expects to receive.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13239872_530715097114585_1982048070478770638_n.jpg?oh=5803f2b684675e9bb333ef32af073da0&oe=58D78C9A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13239872_530715097114585_1982048070478770638_n.jpg?oh=d5da644df9e3c84ab3efc05fce91aeec&oe=59133665	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=530715097114585&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-19T17:52:08+0000	1463680328	2016-05-19 19:52:08	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No British at all. I guess next time I ll bypass Tesco and stick with my local butcher and farm shop.					2016-05-19T15:42:29+0000	1463672549	2016-05-19 17:42:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We stopped in Costa Coffee in clearwater and I noticed my little girl had leaked from her nappy. So I ran into your store to pick up a set of clothes  baby wipes and nappy as I left her changing bag at home. I got to the self service till and started to scan them in. The clothes and wipes scanned in and when I went to scan the pampers(which were 2 packs for 22euro) it wouldn t scan in. After about 5 minutes of waiting for a staff member to come help me  your very unhelpful staff member came over. He tried to put the bar code in manually and when it wouldn t go in he told me he can t sell them to me. I explained the situation to him and had my little girl beside me soaked and he shurged his shoulders. I told him the price and he looked at me blankly. He didn t even try to help. I m sure he could of went or even asked someone else to get a price but no  he left me standing there with my wet child. I will never shop in your store again. I am in shock of how inhuman ur staff are.					2016-05-19T15:34:11+0000	1463672051	2016-05-19 17:34:11	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Make a special trip into store  9yro and her pocket money in tow. No book. Ask at customer services... no. New books only ever come in on a Friday.

I d love it (and I m sure others would too) if you would send us an email/SMS as soon as the order is picked and charged with an outline of what won t be arriving or what has been substituted. Maybe also list the items that will last  less than you d like them to   as are sometimes noted on the receipt too.  This would allow me to pick up the odd thing while I m out if I know the substitute isn t what I wanted and also save me from trying to read the receipt while hunting through the bags at the door trying to find them.

(Order number: 49WHQCP9C). Your online portal still states today as my delivery date.  I am appalled by this as it was bought as a gift and I am catching a train to visit my family this evening  now I am going to show up empty handed. I am also going to have to post the item on to them when it does arrive (more expense!).  If I had been aware of the delay at the time of purchase I would have made other arrangements. (Your website still states products ordered before 5pm/3pm will arrive next day  despite the text I received saying the reason for delay is  recent high demand )  I am thoroughly disappointed and will definitely think twice before ordering from yourselves again  in this case  We re incredibly sorry for any convenience this has caused  doesn t cut it.					2016-05-19T12:27:32+0000	1463660852	2016-05-19 14:27:32	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

That day there was a problem with the chiller cabinets and so many choices weren t visible. When I asked if a salad was on the menu  the staff were very helpful and a delicious ham salad was made up for me.  Today  for the first time  we went into the caf√© at the Beeston store. No sign of salad  I ask and get a puzzled look and a suggestion that maybe they could  put some lettuce and cucumber on a plate with one of the main courses.  That no store does a plated salad. I suspect my first time in here will be my last.  I was disappointed with the lack of healthy choices; the reason I wanted the salad was some idea of what is in the food. All of the available dishes seemed to be laden in cheese (macaroni or lasagna) or in soggy looking pastry. My son had the Mac...it comes with chips...and baked beans (no peas left  it s not even 1pm yet!). The server  upon hearing my concern  rudely pointed at the jacket potatoes - he said I should get that...they come with tuna in full fat Mayo  cheese...or beans (I don t like those).  Now  I think I shall be heading downstairs to the grocery department to find a pot of salad  or maybe some sushi...					2016-05-19T11:55:19+0000	1463658919	2016-05-19 13:55:19	0	3	1	0	4	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I came in to change something but hadn t got my recepit as I ve never had a problem with sizes beforw at tesco. The item was far too big so came in to change them to be told they had none in stock. Chose something else of the same value and was told they had reduced them the day before so I would have to pay the extra. The assistant wasnt very polite and not once did she apologise for what had happened with the reductions. So for the sake of one day I ve ended up losing out money exchanging an item. This isnt the first time I ve encountered less than polite/helpful staff at this store in the last 6 months.					2016-05-19T11:10:21+0000	1463656221	2016-05-19 13:10:21	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After work  I had picked my husband up and we went to our local tesco for tonight s tea and tomorrow s lunch. Tonight s tea we decided on the meal deal which came with a side dish  dessert and a bottle of wine. Quite clearly an adult type of shop and being as we are both nearly 30 (and look around our age) were surprised when we got asked for ID. My husband had his  but I didn t have mine. Because of that  the woman had to reverse most of the shop that we had put through.   Now I understand having to ask for ID  I understand people fear their jobs for potentially serving underage. I understand that the  ask 25  was brought in to have a reason to ask for ID to those who look over 18  but may not be - it s a safe thing to do.  But come on Tesco  surely your staff should have at least a little bit of common sense about them?!  In this example - you have a couple with wedding rings on  one with ID stating they are 29  the other with car keys in hand paying with a credit card that states  mrs  buying a meal deal that comes with a bottle of wine - not a basket full of vodka... very obvious that they are over the age of 18 and are legal to purchase alcahol - the cashier may not have been sure if we were over 25 years old  but surely - common sense and not being a complete jobsworth should have taken over at this point?!  As I said - please give your staff some training rather than just having them ask everyone for ID. The amount of ridiculous stories I hear  but to be personally truly frustrated at a person who is a representative of Tesco... it has made me not want to shop there if I don t happen to have my ID on me on the way home from work - I may not be able to purchase deodorant spray  candles maybe  or even plastic knives?! Where does it stop.					2016-05-18T20:53:38+0000	1463604818	2016-05-18 22:53:38	0	12	0	0	12	12	2	10	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know Tesco aren t to blame  but the inconsiderate people taking them for a joyride  thinking they are an alternative to taking a taxi. Some have even been left outside resident s properties including in their gardens. I think people have worked out that despite your signs telling these scallywags that your trollies will lock if brought beyond your car park  which of course they don t. If you need me to PM you the address details again  please let me know. We pay a Service Charge for the estate to kept top notch. Thanks for listening :D					2016-05-18T20:40:51+0000	1463604051	2016-05-18 22:40:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m just curious if it s true what I ve heard... if one goes into labour in a Tesco store  there s nappies to be claimed?  I only ask as last Monday  my waters broke in the Andover store! I m not only a customer but also a member of staff  I was at work as normal and at 10.45am  *pop*!! Our beautiful boy was born at 3pm that afternoon by emergency c-section.  I ve heard stories about things like this happening to others but never thought it d happen to me! Doesn t hurt to ask  does it. :)  Thanks!					2016-05-18T19:57:53+0000	1463601473	2016-05-18 21:57:53	53	16	55	2	73	16	8	8	27	0	52	2	0	0	0	0	0

The other night I was in one of your fine establishments for 25minutes trying to decide what pizza to get.   It s a rare treat but my partner promised to buy me one for a mid week pizza feast (which is rare because usually I have to eat relatively healthy  at least I m told to anyway).   After running from the checkout to the pizza aisle multiple times to change my mind I settled on a beautiful looking Nacho chicken pizza.   Fast forward a few night to tonight and it s pizza time! I ran to the freezer to grab my delicious pizz-ery goodness. But alas  all was not well.   If you look at exhibit A (the picture) it clearly shows what I expected the pizza to look like compared to what it actually looked like. I can only seem to see one measly crumbled nacho  and in the picture it clearly shows more!   I know you can t judge all pizzas on how one looks in a photo  because this sets very high standards that we cannot expect pizzas to live up to  and I m definitely not a pizza shamer. All pizzas are created equal and pizzas of all shapes and sizes are beautiful inside and out.   But honestly  this isn t really a true representation is it??  Yours disappointedly   Nick  Pizza lover  Slade	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13241184_797455447055527_944201534996901896_n.jpg?oh=9e5b82b0a08ecc4f3d066be8f30301a0&oe=592023E6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13241184_797455447055527_944201534996901896_n.jpg?oh=1a3767d26645b6b1a9275dda45f9661f&oe=58DB97B5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=797455447055527&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-18T19:57:12+0000	1463601432	2016-05-18 21:57:12	14	15	14	0	29	13	12	1	0	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last year I purchased a garden patio from Tesco and it was delivered but extremely small.  This year I decided to buy the exact same patio to extend it.    So visiting the Tesco website I was extremly pleased to see that you still have it on your site  (still on site now)  http://www.tesco.com/direct/the-real-paving-company-nouveau-paving-random-patio-kit-756sqm-york-gold/446-7009.prd  So having placed the order and been told it will arrive on Tuesday  I decided to prepare my garden for it coming so the work can commence.  My garden is currently very messy.   On Tuesday I get the call I ve been waiting for...  Its the suppliers and I m extremely excited until!!!!  He tells me they no longer make this paving and haven t for some time.    OMG!  What the hell am I going to to do..  I have ruined my garden based on the confirmation of the patio being supplied and  It s not coming.   Please can you advise what I do next?					2016-05-18T16:41:54+0000	1463589714	2016-05-18 18:41:54	0	13	0	0	13	12	8	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in the tesco Sunderland extra store today with my 3 year old little boy we had been in store about 30 mins and he was so bored  we got to the check outs and were greeted by a lovely cashier named Joanne (I ll keep her last name private). She was giving me a hand packing when my boy was running around like a little whirlwind up and down the store  she shouted of him over and asked if he would like to give her a hand with his mams shopping  she sat him on her chair and he helped scan most of the shopping through he was absolutely amazed and over the moon that she has let him help her out.   Stress free bag packing for me and a 3 year old with the biggest grin! Joanne really is a credit to the company and it is a shame that there is not more cashiers like that when we have to take one or more of the kids with us shopping!   Thanks again Joanne! You made James day! üòÅ	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13230191_1093655104009691_2285179787875474823_n.jpg?oh=d2062a29c9806aa677d561543f018369&oe=5910C5B3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13230191_1093655104009691_2285179787875474823_n.jpg?oh=cacf90d20ac7bb395f7f160be38e68d5&oe=58DCBBCF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1093655104009691&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-18T15:07:33+0000	1463584053	2016-05-18 17:07:33	316	37	329	27	393	36	26	10	75	0	311	13	0	0	0	0	0

Please can someone explain to me why  for the last 6+ weeks of shopping on line  I order 2 loose yellow and 2 loose red bell peppers. Every week I receive 1 loose yellow pepper?? I have even put it in the additional comments.. Please make sure I get 2 yellow peppers and yet today I receive my shopping and still only 1 yellow pepper?? Now I know that it is only a yellow pepper and not the end of the world but it is every week and it is now getting a little annoying.. That I pay every week for 2 and only get 1.. If I wanted 1 I would put 1.??? I await your response!! Thanks					2016-05-18T14:52:37+0000	1463583157	2016-05-18 16:52:37	2	7	2	0	9	7	4	3	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This morning I bought a packet of Tesco Value Bacon Rashers for my lunch later. I have been looking forward to them all day  they are the only thing that have got me through the day working in the pouring rain  just knowing that if I hold out I can sit down and enjoy the delightful  Bacon Flavour Maize  Rice And Soya Snack  as it says on your packaging.  So when it hit 12:30 I was over the moon  I couldn t wait to tuck into my lunch. I rushed to open the packet and began the mouth watering bacon snacks. I was about halfway through the pack when all of a sudden my worst nightmare became a reality... I had to stop eating them. I was horrified to find a a sticker off of a rolling tobacco deep within the packet it was soul destroying and heart breaking!  I have had to stop eating them as the thought that your company and your employees could do this to me has made me sick to my stomach!   As a result of this I would like action to be taken as I am not amused and I will be waiting on your response!  Yours sincerely   Harry Abbott					2016-05-18T12:04:59+0000	1463573099	2016-05-18 14:04:59	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

About a week or so ago I purchased a couple of skincare products from my local Tesco. My skin is very dry  so the stuff I got was to help clear it up. Only it made matters worse.. My face is now completely covered in dry patches and feels very rough... I was actually recommended these products and was told I could buy them in my local tescos so I bought them to give them a try... Now my face is worse than what it was. As you can probably tell I m not happy and now don t feel confident at all for people to see..					2016-05-18T09:56:25+0000	1463565385	2016-05-18 11:56:25	0	11	0	0	11	11	2	9	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

With the help of my human Mum‚Äôs Facebook account and my human sister Kelly  I‚Äôm sending you a quick message and picture to show you how happy I was to finally become a parent! It all started when I discovered both confidence and small dogs!! My human‚Äôs got me from Dogs Trust Roden a few years ago  I‚Äôd been a stray in Ireland then some numpty took me home and returned me a day later as they said I‚Äôm too big : (  I‚Äôm a Labrador and it‚Äôs just my cuteness bursting from me! Anyway  my forever family found me and saved me from the big Rottweiler I was in a glass case of emotion with (Ron Burgandy reference  stay classy). They took me to a really nice place with lots of grass  lakes  ducks and most importantly ‚Ä¶ other humans with dogs! I have a habit of pushing small dogs over with my head and licking their little dog tummies‚Ä¶ Much to my human family‚Äôs amusement! My mum and sister were shopping in Tesco when they got me what I deem to be a non-animated baby Chocolate Labrador from the ‚ÄòGood Boy‚Äô range (thanks...Armitage Pet Care) which is very fitting for me as I am a good boy :) (they also got me a new water bowl  one of my favourite bones and some really tasty chews ‚Äì spoilt huh? Although I can never have enough. I think I also smelt some Donuts from your delicious bakery in the planet-saving 10p carrier bag too). Since my new baby arrived home  we have been inseparable and when I lick his little dog tummy I don‚Äôt get kicked in the head anymore! Thank you Tesco for making my twitchy laminate-floor nail tapping dreams come true.

Making you customers jump through hoops to use your carpark and shop.  Parking companies are parasites who scam your customers out of money and you let them do it!  Never thought of asking people to add their registration number to their clubcard?  Then your computers could validate the parking and match it with the till receipt automatically without making your paying customers jump through hoops.  I need to go shopping today.

Besides it being personally offensive  it is a health risk as well. I m going to return all the Ashoka products to the shop today. It is a shame because I love seeing new vegan products on the shelves as it makes vegan food more accessible to those who enjoy convenience/ready made food  but this is just completely  unacceptable from Ashoka.

Well after two days of food poisoning I m finally able to write this post. I have had diarrhoea  vomiting  stomach cramps  the sweats and not been able to tolerate either food or fluids. I have already had to miss two days at work  which will be five days by the time I am 48hrs clear. For which I will not be paid!!!!   This was all due to a prepacked prawn sandwich I purchased at the tescos store on saffron lane in Leicester. I know the sandwich was the cause as it was the only thing I ate on Monday morning approx 6 hours before the symptoms started.   I appreciate that tesco must follow all food hygiene regulations but at some point during either the preparation or  Storage of this sandwich it has either been contaminated or the storage temps have not been correct. With a high risk food product such as prawns I find this very scary.					2016-05-18T07:45:22+0000	1463557522	2016-05-18 09:45:22	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They don t have any of my frames in stock could i go for a wander round the shop till she phoned round to see if she can get me frames   ok off I go then when I get back they can t do them in the colour I have so I will have the lilac one s ok that will be ¬£10 to replace them but they re not even 6 months old and the leg just snapped it will still be ¬£10 I m disgusted with there after care. This was the first time I have been to Tesco for glasses and rest assured I will not go back again where i usually go will replace any part of my glasses which has a fault within the first 12 months not that i have ever needed to as their quality of glasses is obviously better.					2016-05-18T06:46:06+0000	1463553966	2016-05-18 08:46:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Once they are gone  they are gone. But we ll still have Tesco.  If you must use palm oil  could it not at least be sustainable palm oil and not the sort responsible for the desolation of the worlds rainforests?					2016-05-18T06:32:46+0000	1463553166	2016-05-18 08:32:46	4	5	4	0	9	5	2	3	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I m now posting it on here......  I visited the Helston Tesco store this evening with my local Beavers group. Although the other kids had a good time  my son on the other hand didn t. You were given notice that my son has Coeliac Disease  therefore would not been able to join in making bread  yes  he said he d wear gloves  but how could a 6 year old enjoy making bread with gloves that were even too big for adults and the fact he would be making a bread to take home  he couldn t even eat?! Yes  he got upset and I had to take him out of the room  because he couldn t understand why he couldn t enjoy it like the others. After calming him down  he then kind of enjoyed the rest of the visit. And then....low and behold  when giving the other children their bread  my son was given NOTHING!! It wasn t until other parents were offering to go and buy him something from the Free From section in front of the lady leading the visit  she then unwillingly went across to the staff cafe  and got him a banana and a pot of fruit!  I mean seriously  a pot of fruit!  which would never of been given to him if it wasn t for other parents aiming hints!! Where was the harm in just getting him a loaf of bread which was just downstairs from his section and put in a bag so he wasn t made to feel different and left out!! I am completely disappointed and angry that yet again my son was pushed out  and not by his choice. This is a medical condition  not a choice! He is 6 and still doesn t quite understand  and people wonder why he gets so upset!! Absolutely disgusting. No reason at all why something wasn t arranged for him considering the amount of notice given. Safe to say  I WILL NOT be visiting your store again!!					2016-05-17T21:28:12+0000	1463520492	2016-05-17 23:28:12	3	8	14	1	23	8	7	1	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	10	0

I bought a pair of shoes from your Kingston  Milton Keynes store today and only discovered when I got home that the store assistant had left the security tag on. This wouldn t be so bad if A. The security tag wasn t blatantly obvious and B. The store itself wasn t 15 miles away from my home.  I am extremely unimpressed. I m now left with a pair of shoes that I cannot wear for the foreseeable future and a very inconvenient journey of 15 miles just to get a security tag removed because of your employees  complete incompetence.

I don t drive and my partner works shifts  we make a trip to the Kingston store once a month  on average.

Went to your store in Parkhead  Glasgow this afternoon with my two sons to pick up our dinner and some other bits and pieces. My youngest son was exhausted after a long day at school and was so looking forward to one of your fresh fruit packs  he always has strawberry and grape.   Today the strawberry and grape was out of stock  and Damon didn t take this very well. (An overtired 6 year old  creature of habit!) The alternative was a grape and apple pack  and apparently it just wasn t going to cut it.  The tears were just beginning to roll down his face and making an equally tired Mummy panic  when one of your wonderful Greengrocers named George came over.. With a handful of strawberries for Damon and his brother  and told him not to cry about it.  What a hero.  Thankyou George  from Sarah  Aiden and Damon xx					2016-05-17T19:39:04+0000	1463513944	2016-05-17 21:39:04	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  I m continually disappointed by the state the store is in at that time of night. Cages and rollers of stock  boxes and packaging block off access to aisles and are also a trip and slip hazard! I understand it s a quiet time with not many customers in store  but it is still a hazard to those that want to use the store at night.  Just thought it might be an issue worth raising with staff members :)					2016-05-17T18:44:58+0000	1463510698	2016-05-17 20:44:58	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was pleased you were expanding the pasta range to something other than spaghetti or penne so I bought some to have for dinner this evening. Yeah  well  the WHOLE packet ended up IN THE BIN as it turned to a very sticky  gloopy mush of white stuff that resembled liquid glue!!!!! Thankfully I had some other pasta in the cupboard I could use and dinner was eventually saved! I am horrified to think that it could turn out this way  especially when I cooked it properly  followed the instructions  and to be honest  I have many many years of experience of cooking. This was disgusting! I m sorry Tesco  but this product is a big  fat fail and I certainly won t be buying it again! It s bad enough to find good alternatives to  normal  food  but to then be further disappointed is not acceptable!					2016-05-17T18:28:26+0000	1463509706	2016-05-17 20:28:26	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Anyways we decided not to eat the watermelon and we would wait until tomorrow. So I went to work and told the staff that tonight I was going to have watermelon and everyone was like  hmmmm watermelon always means it s summer time  (see even they said it) and the 8 hour count down was on until I could leave for home....Well those 8 hours went really slow as I was far to excited at the prospect of getting home to some lovely  juicy chunks of the melon. But my joy was short lived as when the melon was cut this is what I saw.  This has ruined my day.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13260078_10157073652725724_5308441382639536959_n.jpg?oh=1a9e71831651ab3c68519794d3d3ea02&oe=591FE659	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13260078_10157073652725724_5308441382639536959_n.jpg?oh=251d810ad0da1cb64016f7168c7819d2&oe=59239254	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157073652725724&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-17T17:58:35+0000	1463507915	2016-05-17 19:58:35	4	4	4	1	9	4	4	0	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

(I ve been informed I can t name the store or actual person for legal reasons)  A went over and beyond in customer service with a recent dilemma I was faced with when trying to work out how best to order food for my sons christening.  The christening was to take place on a Sunday morning however I needed to be able to set the food up at the venue prior to the church service at 10.30am.  I wanted to order fresh food and collect/receive it as close to the actual morning as I could. Having absolutely no family locally or anyone to call upon that wasn t going to be at the christening themselves  A was my absolute hero of the day.  He suggested I order the food online for the first delivery slot of the actual day and he personally would speak to the online team regarding me collecting it from store instead of it going out on the lorry.  As the day drew nearer and the online team not being sure my order would be processed in time  A decided he didn t want to leave it to chance. He came into work on his day off and personally said  if the order wasn t ready for me to collect by 9am  he would deliver it direct to the venue himself.  This true act of kindness was overwhelming to me. It prevented such worry as to how I would a) sort all the food myself and b) if anything went wrong on the day. He simply took my worries away. I couldn t be more grateful. This was exceptional service and the party food quality was lovely  everyone was commenting on the day.  Please pass on my thanks and appreciation to A  a credit to your store and a great person. Thank you x					2016-05-17T17:40:26+0000	1463506826	2016-05-17 19:40:26	7	3	7	0	10	3	1	2	1	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought a h20 x5 steam mop last year at beginning of May. Using yesterday and it breaks. No steam so therefore useless. Phone today to be told as I m one week over the year warranty my only option is to take a ten pound refund when the mop cost ¬£40. No repair or replacement offered as out with 1year. Ask to make a formal complaint to which I m told that speaking to the team leader is me making a formal complaint. Shop in local tesco daily  buy petrol from tesco  have tesco credit card  tesco travel insurance and buying groceries online fortnightly too. When asked if anything they could do as I m a loyal customer they said nothing further they could do. So much for brand loyalty. Isn t worth a thing.					2016-05-17T17:17:46+0000	1463505466	2016-05-17 19:17:46	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The checkout area seems more like a staff social club than a place to pay for goods  Several times recently i have used the self service area and other customers are having problems with the till the staff just casually stand around in groups gossiping or playing with their phone  a good few minutes have passed before customers have to ask for assistance  yesterday i went to a manned checkout and the lad that was serving me was more concerned talking to his friend who clearly did not work at the store about cars and driving lessons and did not even acknowledge i was there.

The stocking system there is completely broken - things seem to sell out within about a day and take between a week and a month to be restocked again. There are always gaps upon gaps on the shelves. I can literally never get more than about 2/3 of the things on my list. The gluten free section is always run right down  often I can t get the pasta or the Warburton s wraps. Soy yoghurt is sold out half the time. I ve just waited three weeks for dark Chocologic to be available again. Almost any time I go in towards the end of the afternoon (4pm onwards) when most people want to do their shopping  there is a lamentable shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables. Salad bowls  celery sticks  fresh strawberries or raspberries all keep selling out. Two days ago you finally brought in cauliflower couscous  which I adore - today it s gone again.  I m seriously considering giving up and switching to Sainsbury s  even though it s further to walk...					2016-05-17T16:36:21+0000	1463502981	2016-05-17 18:36:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After venturing to your store and buying 3 boxes of said ice cream  my husband probably felt safe for at least a few days. Throw a cone at the hormonal pregnant lady and all will be good. It all started well until box number 2. So far  the first 2 cones have had a severe lack of chocolate (in fact none around the top of the wafer). Disappointed  but could live with this until I opened the cone pictured...WHERE IS MY WAFER?? None there at all  just ice cream and chocolate!

While in store my daughter asked if she could go and look at the fish in the fish counter as she always does and off she went. By the time I had caught up with her one of your fab staff was with her. Down on her knees showing her all the different fish and what they were called. She even went as far to go and get a crab from out the freezer so my daughter could see it as they didn t have one displayed. I didn t get the ladies name. But just wanted to say thank you for making a boring shopping trip for a 3 year old exciting. She absolutely loved it.

She has saved me a lot of stress this afternoon and for that I want to say a big thank you!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13254396_10153877371733801_237024958118731955_n.jpg?oh=21a69da1718482cf065be0d99ae4a80d&oe=58DBC866	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13254396_10153877371733801_237024958118731955_n.jpg?oh=1a6fc38fea3717badb9e374fb8a518f6&oe=59176673	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153877371733801&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-17T15:27:39+0000	1463498859	2016-05-17 17:27:39	35	6	37	0	43	4	2	2	7	0	35	2	0	0	0	0	0

I scratch my head though when many still fail to think why a receipt is issued to them with their needs.					2016-05-17T15:00:36+0000	1463497236	2016-05-17 17:00:36	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I tried to place an online order on Sunday 15th May.  My password was not recognised so I clicked that I forgot my password  where it said I should get an e-mail to reset it within 15 minutes.  I waited an hour and no e-mail. Soooo..... I repeated the process and got the same  again no e-mail after an hour. I phoned Customer Services who said the system might just be slow and wait longer.  I did wait longer  until the next day in fact.  On Monday 16th I still had no e-mail so phoned Customer Support again.  The woman said she would personally send me an e-mail with the link to reset password  and did while I was on the phone to her.  She said it should come within 15 minutes.  I waited an hour again and still no e-mail.  I phoned Customer Services again to check they had my e-mail correctly.  They did.  I also had checked my junk mail folder  and my blocked list  and Tesco were not in either.  They put me through to  a computer or I.T. team .  The guy said he would cancel my account completely and then I could simply re-register online; he said I could try in 4 hours time but that it could take up to 24 hours.  I did try after 4 hours  no luck  so left it 27 hours.  On Tuesday 17th (today) I tried to re-register online and it said my e-mail was already registered.  I tried to re-register with another e-mail address I use but it said my Clubcard was already registered.  So much for my account being cancelled??  I phoned Customer Services.  Not a happy bunny that it has so far taken me 3 days to try and place an order.  Customer Services said they dont know why this is happening but would ring me back.  Lady phoned me back to say that my account HAD NOT BEEN CANCELLED the day before (Tesco  why not??) and that she would do it right now while I was on the phone.  She said to wait 24 hours and then re-register.  I told her that is exactly what I was told yesterday.  That will be 4 DAYS TO PLACE AN ORDER!!!  I thought  Goodbye Tesco  you are having a laugh!  ; but then the Customer Services lady told me that I might not have blocked Tesco myself but that my e-mail provider might have blocked Tesco.    I am trying to be patient and not blame Tesco  but has anyone else heard of this before?  Has anyone else had Tesco blocked but not by themselves?  How can I check if Tesco is blocked when they do not appear on my blocked list?					2016-05-17T14:36:47+0000	1463495807	2016-05-17 16:36:47	0	4	0	1	5	4	2	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For example I ve set it yesterday morning to the correct time but this morning woken up to it saying 00.25  which obviously means he has to bring it to me to change the time in the parent settings (he s only 5). We allow his profile to be used from 7am-7pm with a set amount of time for each day.  I keep setting the time manually as when I say use networks time and date it sets it to the wrong time anyway!  Also we ve just ordered 2 memory cards as my other sons hudl2 cannot download anything as says storage is full  is it easy to transfer apps onto the card? We ve bought ones with a good transfer speed as recommended by Tesco.					2016-05-17T14:04:12+0000	1463493852	2016-05-17 16:04:12	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

None in stock. So he asked someone and was told that they aren t a permanent stock item  they just get them sent occasionally and always sell out.   You d think if something flies (no pun intended) off the shelf like that  they d be a permanent item! So disappointing. Another tesco let down. It s more annoying than the big vinyl sign outside advertising the round lettuce that is also not a stock item.					2016-05-17T13:43:40+0000	1463492620	2016-05-17 15:43:40	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It hasnt been dropped or come into contact with water or anything like that. I ve tried holding down the volume and power buttons etc but nothing seems to be working. I ve also tried both computer and mains changing using the official charger but again no luck. My Daughter is chewing my ears off over this. I know it is out of warranty now as its over 12 months old. Any ideas please guys? Thanks in advance :)					2016-05-17T12:10:38+0000	1463487038	2016-05-17 14:10:38	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Almost every time we order something from direct (whether coming from yourselves or a supplier) we have problems!  Trying to sort issues with a bike we ve had is proving to be very hard work and time consuming.  The latest information I ve been advised is that  things happen in transit... We don t know what happens on the back of the van  (this is quoting your customer assistant) and told me to take the bike to Halfords for a service... Coming out of my pocket!  How ridiculous.

I have shopped with Tesco since 1986 but if they check   my last weekly shop was the week before last.  I ordered online elsewhere.  This  after numerous complaints about short dated products and produce going off within date.  The final straw was a late delivery  where the manager or staff  didn t make a phone call to explain or apologise.  It seems that no one loaded the afternoon delivery van  so the driver did it on his return.  He apologised profusely and asked me to highlight the problem with the company.  An email to Tesco customer services was acknowledged but never responded to.  Message received loud and clear  the customer is not important.  The produce bought from the new supplier has lasted extremely well too.  Peppers are still fresh after a week as are carrots  tomatoes  and some avocado pears.

So off I skip to my nearest store  money in hand to buy my goods. I get to the store and see before me a wide range of lovely fresh fruit. Scan my eyes to the right and see another mouthwatering display of fresh vegetables....but wait.... where are the onions?? I search and search but cannot find them. I see a member of staff putting out that mornings delivery so I thought  Ah they just haven t put them out yet . Alas the lovely employee sadly informed me that you did not supply the store with onions. :( no brown  no red  no shallots  not even ready chopped! So here I sit  typing this out  eating my lonely egg sandwich with a tear running down my cheek  thinking of the onion that might have been. Now I know some might say that I could have went somewhere else  however where I live  my closest store is a Tesco express. I know that  express  stores have limited stock availability but considering that  it is the only store that isn t a 3 mile camel ride away I think you are missing out on a winner here. So I beg you Tesco  please supply my local with our beloved onions! Plus I m pretty sure this is discrimination of the onion lovers! Kind regards  One lonely egg sandwich <3					2016-05-17T09:30:37+0000	1463477437	2016-05-17 11:30:37	31	44	40	5	89	36	10	26	66	0	30	1	0	8	0	0	0

My husband took the trolley back to the trolley station and as we were driving off a lovely member of your staff ran after us with a box of washing powder that we had left in the trolley...his honesty and kindness were very much appreciated and we would like him to know that we had noticed how good a job he was doing and thank him for returning our washing powder for us. It s a small gesture but small gestures mean a lot and all too often we are faced with complaints and negativity. If it helps you track this person to pass on our thanks we were in tesco on Monday 16th and we left at 430ish which is when we met this man.

Unfortunately  it was not packed properly and the sugar was placed on top of a sharp edge of another item and it split! To say it split is an understatement!! There is a trail of sugar along the carpet  in the lift and then on the carpet of the block of flats. Seeing as the sugar was in the top box  it has spilt over everything!!!! The driver was very apologetic and helped me to wipe.... Every fruit and veg  bottle of drink  tins  wipes etc!! There is a coating of sugar liberally spread over my floor and inevitably in my cupboards and fridge as it will be impossible to wipe it all away!  I was refunded for the said bag of sugar but that is kind of irrelevant!! I appreciate that giving out bags is against the law  but surely for delicate items such as sugar  they should be placed in something to ensure this doesn t happen more often....  I unfortunately only thought to take a picture after I had swept and wiped several items but you get the gist!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13260100_10156878559605322_6412552285556864449_n.jpg?oh=8f37f5e02355f8547144edb4379520ba&oe=59230F71	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13260100_10156878559605322_6412552285556864449_n.jpg?oh=11cec960e556d297111771693d0744a5&oe=59079D7C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156878559605322&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-17T07:32:09+0000	1463470329	2016-05-17 09:32:09	3	11	6	0	17	11	7	4	4	0	3	0	0	0	1	2	0

First mistake - booked slot to deliver: Saturday night 9-10pm  gets to 10:30... Still nothing  I ring them to be told that the driver was going around for 45 minutes unable to find us and that they would book me another slot for the next day.  Second mistake - Once food is finally delivered the next driver manages not to give me my frozen food...   Third (and rather damming) mistake - the company charge me twice  over ¬£100  for groceries that cost half of that!!   I found this disgusting and require a refund straight away as well as a better apology then just a bunch of cheap flowers!					2016-05-17T03:46:56+0000	1463456816	2016-05-17 05:46:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Slimming World helps to support people who are on a life journey to make themselves and their families eat healthier.  I  for one  spend a lot of money in Tesco s trying to do this  but I have to say that I am now having second thoughts on this  and going elsewhere.  Its no wonder that Tesco s is losing money  if you keep on p*ssing off your customers like this  they will find supermarkets who do support their local communities.  Even Public Health England are trying to help people to eat more healthier and lose weight by offering up discounts for Slimming World  come on Tesco s join the thousands of shops that support Slimming World.					2016-05-16T22:11:12+0000	1463436672	2016-05-17 00:11:12	4	9	5	0	14	9	4	5	1	0	4	1	0	0	0	0	0

This is our last boost which is disappointing in itself. Tonight I ordered a ps4 game using boost vouchers. 30 minutes after having the order confirmation  I get another email stating that tesco direct are unable to fulfill this order. No explaination whats so ever.  What is more the original amount of 2300 clubcard points are to be credited to my clubcard account... Therefore missing out on the boost. BTW game still showing in stock! What s that all about!?					2016-05-16T20:37:45+0000	1463431065	2016-05-16 22:37:45	0	12	0	0	12	12	8	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The 2 ladies behind the counter were speaking about another member of staff and didn t acknowledge me. When they finally did serve me she carried on speaking to the other member of staff. I was then told I could not return the item and she pointed at the sign. Customer service was shocking. I m not one to complain but I felt like I was putting them out by buying something today. I did not buy the item in the end!					2016-05-16T20:23:04+0000	1463430184	2016-05-16 22:23:04	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered Patent Leather Bow Trim School Shoes. I collected my order from my local Tesco and when I got home and opened the packaging  I had a different pair of school shoes (not the ones I had ordered) At first I thought I might just keep these ones to save the hassle of returning them as my daughter is in desperate need of new school shoes but when I looked at the shoes they had dirt and grit at the bottom of the sole as if they had been used. I am appalled that you not only sent me the wrong order  you sent me a used pair of school shoes. I will be returning these shoes back to you ASAP. I can understand there might be a error sometimes with orders but to send me dirty used shoes is not acceptable. I expect better from a big company like tesco.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13240655_10153770503181633_3000379515505255362_n.jpg?oh=23079cfb899581c8e4c47555eea4dc1a&oe=591FB942	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13240655_10153770503181633_3000379515505255362_n.jpg?oh=22f2b67c555358704bdaca16863fe987&oe=58D9CF4F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153770503181633&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-16T19:30:00+0000	1463427000	2016-05-16 21:30:00	3	14	3	0	17	14	5	9	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I took my mother in law  my 17 month old girl and 4 week old son for a quick shop and decided to have a quick breakie at the cafe. We stood near the hot food when a lady that was serving came over and put her apron on. My mother in law said please can I have two bacon to which the woman said  can I get changed first?  Sorry I thought u had started ur shift we didn t realise we just walked into ur living room. Letting it go we moved on. I started to pour my MIL a latte and myself a cappuccino. My MIL said to the  friendly lady  how much please to which she snapped well I don t know what drinks ur having do I.... Surely most people will say what drinks are u having.... my LG then decided to have a quick flee to the side of where she was standing. The lovely lady didn t hide her enormous eye roll. MY little girl is 17 months old she will dart any where. My mother in law then asked the lady what her problem was. She gave such a dirty look and said her head was banging. To which we said perhaps u shudnt be working. I know it might not seem like a lot in writing but never in my life have I known customer service like it. I was reeling all morning.... üò°üò°üò°üò°					2016-05-16T18:59:57+0000	1463425197	2016-05-16 20:59:57	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have 2x¬£20 this quarter and absolutely will not want ¬£80 of vouchers to one place at one time. Although I know any  change  goes back into my account  I still find it most unfair. They should all be issued in highest value ¬£5. So  for example  if I have 42.50 of vouchers I should receive 8x¬£5 and 1x¬£2.50					2016-05-16T18:32:37+0000	1463423557	2016-05-16 20:32:37	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I couldn t face baking it so my husband popped in to Tesco Twickenham to grab a cake. To his (and my) delight the jammy dodger cake was dairy free so I could have some too. It was only once home did we realise that it was three days out of date.  I know people will come on and say it s your responsibility to check dates  true  however I think it can be forgiven as obviously it s an upsetting day for us.   We rang your helpline and they tried to ring Twickenham to find out if they had more  they didn t pick up so the helpline offered to ring another store. We suggested Osterley. We requested a call back considering we had already been on hold for a considerable amount of time and it was costing us money. We missed the call back so decided to pop along to Osterley to find out if they had any.   Both jammy dodger cakes were battered  searched for more milk free cakes  the me to you cakes honestly looked like they d been sat on  both of them have half the box crushed and so did many of the other cakes or the boxes ripped open.   We spoke to customer services both about the fact that the helpline was suppose to call them (she said this infact had not happened) and the mess the cakes were all in  as we exchange the cake. She didn t care and wasn t going to do anything about the cakes left there.  Any way  the cake we got cost more plus two journeys to and from the stores  as well as the cost of the phone call. Tesco made an already rubbish not only cost more but be worse than it was.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13179015_1101881996538014_4827825640446738660_n.jpg?oh=e221ca3e7668523ae771cee53b35b430&oe=590610C1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13179015_1101881996538014_4827825640446738660_n.jpg?oh=f1ac4b82b0026ae4ac2b8aed11517a94&oe=591412BD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1101881996538014&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-16T18:27:37+0000	1463423257	2016-05-16 20:27:37	0	9	0	0	9	9	6	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m so pleased that Tesco offers this vegan choice in their ¬£3 meal deal! The wrap is delicious! One thing though  there are many salads that are vegetarian and with just ONE tiny tweak (milk) could be so easily made vegan-friendly!

We will be holding a fun day at The Worthies Sports and Social Club on the 31st July. This will include some craft stalls  raffle and some fun and games with a bbq and live band.  As one of the major companies in the area  I was hoping you would be able to help us out with the donation of a raffle prize. This would be great appreciated.

On the 27th April I went to collect a PS4 click-and-collect from your Manford Way Tesco Express. When I arrived  the box had already been opened and I was offered a refund. I took the PS4 to test whether it was okay  and after a couple of weeks had worked out there were some problems with both the HDMI and ethernet port.  I called Tesco Direct on the 13th May to get an exchange for a new  fully-working PS4 and I requested an on-the-doorstep exchange for today. I later received an e-mail telling me the item was being sent to the Manford Way store. When I called up and queried why it was not being sent to my home  I was told they were unable to change it and that I would have to pick it up from the store.  A later e-mail informed me that it would be delivered to the store between 10:36am and 11:36am. I arrived after this time  and was told that the delivery had not come and that I should return at 3pm. When I returned after 3pm  I was told that the delivery had been signed for but that the item had been returned and was no longer in the store. The staff were very unhelpful and unsympathetic  and told me to go to the Barkingside store  either to swap the PS4 for a new one there  or to speak to their customer service to resolve the issue (rather than the Manford Way staff dealing with the problem). I spoke to a very pleasant and helpful lady called Tracy there  who tried her very best to get in contact with Manford Way and find out the problem. However  the store would not answer their phone. After being there for about an hour and a half  Tracy had obtained that Suget from Manford Way signed for the item at 10:42am (an hour BEFORE I was told that the item was not in store) and I went back to Manford Way with this information because no one could get in contact with them from Barkingside customer service.  I returned and spoke to the Manford Way manager  who had no idea what had happened to the item. She rang Suget  and handed me the phone to talk to him directly. He told me  they took it back  with no details of who or why. After a long wait  I was told by the manager that they had rung Tesco Direct and that I would be able to obtain a new one. I left the store  rang Tesco Direct and was told that they had received no such call or information. I am still waiting for them to return my call  despite assuring me they would call back within the hour.  I had planned this evening with my friends centred around my new PS4  so not only has my day been wasted  my evening has been ruined too. I am appalled by the lack of care and attention taken by Manford Way staff towards me and my problem. I have wasted both time and money  as well as a day off of work  pursuing my PS4 which has apparently vanished into thin air. I have never experienced such a disregard for customer satisfaction and correct procedure. I work in retail myself and I cannot fathom how such unbelievable inattentiveness can be tolerated in a store such as yours.					2016-05-16T17:10:35+0000	1463418635	2016-05-16 19:10:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received the new item delivered to store the day after making the initial call to Tesco Direct. They totally understood my query  the staff were very helpful and all was dealt with in a helpful  professional  friendly manner. Tesco went above and beyond for me thank you! Customers are sometimes quick to complain about things which is why I always feel it s important to give positive feedback. What more could a customer want! I only wish I knew the name of the guy that served me in store to pass on my thanks.					2016-05-16T16:37:12+0000	1463416632	2016-05-16 18:37:12	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The best before date is 06/06/15. Both packs of pizza bases are still sealed. Both packs have clear mould growth. I only checked before I opened them as the last packet of pizza bases I bought were also mouldy. As I have to travel over 10 miles to get to Tesco  being refunded the price of the pizza bases only covers the fuel required to get there.

They now contain soya! Ever since my now two year old son was diagnosed with multiple allergies  I converted to shopping and Tesco and in all honesty  you ve never let me down. Adding more and more products to your shelves. It may seem to many that it s just a biscuit; my son has a very limited diet but he loved these biscuits I m so saddened by this change.					2016-05-16T13:39:35+0000	1463405975	2016-05-16 15:39:35	7	13	7	2	22	13	8	5	15	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having been a customer of yours my entire adult life  I regularly take advantage of your promotions and generous discounts that you issue to club card customers  and everyone in general.  However  having worked in retail  advertising and marketing for a number of years  this gives me a discerning eye and a reasonable insight into marketing psychology and pricing structures.  It is with great bemusement that nowadays I regularly come across promotions which  no disrespect  but make no sense whatsoever.  I have seen twin packs of cheese for 50p less than the single blocks for instance  and wonder just who is now buying these single packs.. for more than the twin packs??  Also would this not increase the risk of the product going beyond its sell by date  and does that not end up costing more in losses than you gain from the promotion?   I also seen a tin of Napolina chopped tomatoes.  ¬£1.05 each  2 for ¬£1.. and now these at ¬£2 each  twin packs for ¬£4.50  In all my years I ve never seen anything like it  and so would like to enquire whether you would have any part time/consultant vacancies  for I love the company.. and would just like things to make sense again.  Kind regards  John	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13227047_1144937155562832_5338298194675750396_n.jpg?oh=5ed5112b20d30ae745a4481c71b9228d&oe=59144FFD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13227047_1144937155562832_5338298194675750396_n.jpg?oh=5c79f0f67b925d31c6af2b28fba9ed41&oe=591054E8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1144937155562832&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-16T13:30:05+0000	1463405405	2016-05-16 15:30:05	2	8	3	1	12	8	2	6	3	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

Assistant asked me if I was on any medication.  I said I was taking blood pressure pills.  She said that was ok and sold me a pack which cost ¬£9.  On arriving home I read the leaflet enclosed in the pack and it stated that one of the conditions which you should not take these pills was high blood pressure.  The assistant should have spoken to the pharmacist and not sold these off her own bat.  Not very good customer service and I for one will not be buying anything from the pharmacy at a Tesco store.

I got her out and carried her for a bit of a cuddle and within minutes she d fallen asleep on me. Each member of staff I passed asked if they could help as I carried out and finished my shopping g and the lady on the checkout helped get my shopping onto the conveyor belt and then packed it all for me. Staff even offered to help me out to the car with the full trolley. I was having a particularly trying day until then and the staff have put a smile on my face again!

I asked 3 sets of staff (totalling 6 members) and none of them could give me a straight answer where I might find them  and no one offered to help me look.

You sent me information weeks ago regarding double your clubcard vouchers starting again today.  So  as I needed a new freezer  I decided to wait and use my vouchers to one.  Went through your website and chose the one and only one that would fit my space and have just been on to buy it and get to checkout where it says that all my vouchers are unavailable to use  as its not a freezer sold by Tesco.  How ridiculous! It s on your website.  Now I ve waited over two weeks for a new freezer when I could have just gone to Argos and purchased one immediately.  Absolutely disgusted.					2016-05-16T09:22:29+0000	1463390549	2016-05-16 11:22:29	0	10	0	0	10	10	4	6	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This weekend I took my grocery delivery  amongst which I had nappies for my daughter. However they were unable to send my selected nappies and instead chose a replacement of the next size up!!!  How on earth could someone think a nappy to fit a 15lb child could be replaced with one for a 20lb - 40 lb child?  Seriously  no sense or thought at all?!  So I of course rejected for refund  I then had to spend petrol and time for my other half to go to a store and buy the ones we wanted.  On top of that  yet again bags over loaded  (I pay for bags and yet they seem to think it s fine to over fill so they break!). Heavy tins and items then put into the crates on top of soft fruit bread and eggs.  To say I am fed up with the total uselessness of the home delivery packers is an understatement  I have spoken to the store on numerous occasions and it seems nothing is done  Please can the Sudbury Tesco store either train their staff or employ some with a few brain cells that have common sense enough to get the job done properly.					2016-05-16T08:12:39+0000	1463386359	2016-05-16 10:12:39	0	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

I returned the item to your llansamlet store and showed the staff the burn marks on my arm from where the flask imploded.   My car mats were covered in boiling water and shards of glass and I begged you not to sell these to anyone else as they are so dangerous. No one has contacted me to follow up. Id like reassurance that no one else will be injured from these.					2016-05-15T20:48:23+0000	1463345303	2016-05-15 22:48:23	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Since before last Xmas. I have spoken with various staff about the large quantity of green spuds on a Saturday morning when I shop. I appreciate its early; 9:15 ish but really.....not good. The staff recognise me now and last time I was taken to the fruit and veg manager to explain my concern. I can only assume my comments were not taken seriously. What if a partially sighted person or my daughter  who has special needs but maybe doesn t understand the hazards of green potatoes  picks them up when she hopefully is able to shop independently. Please can you do something about it  yesterdays were shocking quality as well as green  ....again. Here s a snap for you  the greeness of the ones on left doesn t show up well but honestly....	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13237767_10153762327599755_4736805347731580267_n.jpg?oh=d4c3a8b8a67bc2ba44dd8b9577385fdb&oe=591CEEC9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13237767_10153762327599755_4736805347731580267_n.jpg?oh=762ed7233cc7b6ded29e6457f6133b13&oe=591407BD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153762327599755&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-15T19:04:13+0000	1463339053	2016-05-15 21:04:13	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wanted to say as a mum of a child with six different food allergies  it s nice to see a wide range of  free from  foods. What s more  my daughter is 3 and has to always miss out on cakes and ice creams etc......but now with your range she can enjoy the same foods as the rest of the family. She tried the new fruit splits today while her brother and sister had their ice lollies and she was so pleased she was able to have similar. She said they were delicious.

I think you need to recall everyone of these. I was sooo looking forward to a beef dinner. Now we are stuck having a beefless dinner. This is Tesco roast in the bad beef joint. DO NOT ROAST IT IN THE BAG..As soon as you remove it from the over once cooked  the bag very quickly hardens and causes this mess to happen. The plastic broke into many pieces going everywhere  including onto the meat. I couldnt serve beef with plastic bits all over it. Ok i could of picked it all off but some of the bits are tiny and hard to see.. Plus i dont fancy me and my children getting ill or something.  Ive added a picture to the comments of the packaging.

I bought these green beans only on Friday for tonight s meal  and they specifically say on the front their best before is today  so they should still be ok. Looking at them they are brown and obviously off. Please see picture of the other side in the comments for more detail of how off they look.

Then even if I say no it is not. They then choose to not believe me and refuse to sell me the Alcohol. This is humiliating in front of the other shopper s.  Please can you tell me at what age should my children STOP helping me with my shopping. I have never been refused Alcohol when I shop online and it is delivered to my door.  I am 52 and been a Clubcard member of many many years.  She said  I am only doing my job !!  I think you should make it VERY CLEAR in LARGE writing (not got very good eyesight) that if you have alcohol in your shopping and have anyone WITH you who APPEARS to look UNDER 25 WILL NOT BE SOLD ALCOHOL.  I am planning many BBQs as I have 5 children ages between 31 and 15‚Ä¶many friends and plan to buy lots of Alcohol  however  I will never step foot inside a TESCO again.  Also if I wanted to let MY children have a drink it is MY right as  a Parent to make that choice and not TESCOs.

The customer service consultant offered to call me back the next day to confirm if it would be possible. When she called  she confirmed the item was being dispatched and it should be with me on the Friday or Saturday in time for his birthday on the Sunday. No sign of it on the Friday so I called again to be rudely advised that despite the tracking page confirming it was dispatched on the 4th May  this actually did not mean it was dispatched and could mean it was awaiting collection from the warehouse.  After hearing this we made alternative arrangements to get something else. With still no sign of his main present on the Monday or Tuesday we have since been on holiday and arrived home today to find no effort has been made to deliver his present. The tracking page is still showing as dispatched. Really disappointed with the poor customer service and would not recommend ordering goods  especially gifts  from Tesco Direct.					2016-05-15T16:53:14+0000	1463331194	2016-05-15 18:53:14	4	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	1	0	1	0

I have no idea whatsoever of the foundation of this radical claim and so I asked for an explanation.  She assumed I was another person therefore  for she briefly mentioned of an incident whereby a person had been accosted (sic) outside the shop  but after my repeated request of at what time and date I was not informed.  Within seconds of her choosing to enter into a dialogue with me  she resumes serving customers at the tills alongside at least two other staff members yet claimed I was interrupting the customer.  Several minutes later she claimed she was going to check a database to verify the identity of the actual barred person.  Her tone and attitude throughout was insistent of her assertation that I could not possibly be some other person and arrogant.   It felt somewhat like a medieval public flogging.  I am ashamed of Tesco at the complete failing of the judgement of the shop assistant (and moreover the fact no colleague intervened because there was doubt of my identity).  I will from now on feel apprehension of entering any Tesco shop as a result.  If given the opportunity to clear my name at the time  it would have given my continued freedom to enter this particular shop.  I was unable to have any resolution to the accusation  and therefore I deem it an act of slander.  I felt utterly humiliated and indignant having had a public display of apparent wrong-doing.  I am very serious in what I say and I expect you solemn consideration on this matter of utmost importance.  My next steps will include Social Media and potentially instructing of my lawyer regarding this matter.  I await your full and prompt response.					2016-05-15T16:06:02+0000	1463328362	2016-05-15 18:06:02	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 7 year old daughter joined me by the pump and I was told over the tannoy that she wasn t allowed to be there and needs to get into the car. She did this  whilst I finished fuelling. When I asked the staff why this was the case they stated Under 16s are not allowed by the pump. Your Signage states that Under 16s are not allowed to USE the pump. If this is the case you need to change these signs as they are misleading. Otherwise your staff need to be briefed on the correct procedures. I look forward to receiving your response.					2016-05-15T14:29:50+0000	1463322590	2016-05-15 16:29:50	3	13	3	1	17	13	5	8	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am coeliac so went to the free from section  the only thing i could take was biscuits so i noticed finest spicy ginger cookies i took one of the several pacs there. I ran for my train and started eating the biscuits.   i had eaten two before i realised they were ordinary biscuits and had been put in wrong section.  I am now quite ill as my guts have been damaged by the gluten. Whilst I clearly should have read the label better the issue was caused by your staff putting ordinary food in with all the free from food. Coeliacs are very careful and I do read labels but when in a store you trust with a free from section you expect it to be free from products  sometimes we are in a rush and this can mean we put our trust in you.   Please ask all your stores to check the free from sections and remove items that should not be there. This is an chronic illness and I know I will be sick for some time due to this.					2016-05-15T14:15:02+0000	1463321702	2016-05-15 16:15:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have always been happy with your fruit and veg tesco but I have noticed a definite decline in quality since you have started using Redmere farm products. I commented on a post in March and expressed how dissatisfied I was with the quality of the fruit and how my raspberries and strawberries started to go mouldy within 48 of purchase and were inedible before their use by date  I wasn t the only one experiencing this with your fruit either. You requested a picture but the fruit had already been binned and I had stopped buying your fruit and decided to make an extra shopping trip a week and buy my fruit from Aldi instead  where I found the fruit comparable or cheaper in price and better quality. However  I have continued to purchase my vegetables from you but haven t been overly satisfied and below are the pictures of some Redmere Farm potatoes I have purchased this morning. I hope the black was just on the surface  however  it became apparent once I started to cut into the badness continued throughout. Some of the potatoes I couldn t end up using and the ones I could have used have ended up very small in size once I cut off all the black. I think I will continue to purchase all fruit and veg from Aldi now on and this will take my shop below ¬£40  therefore  I will no longer qualify for free click and collect which has always been the most convenient way to shop for me and my family. Taking this into account  and considering I am already doing an extra shopping trip at Aldi for my fruit  I feel it would be more convenient for me to purchase all my weekly shop there instead.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13173745_10206745961749378_8007972861262352013_n.jpg?oh=5e1fcdef51670441575710e9c536426f&oe=58DB0203	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13173745_10206745961749378_8007972861262352013_n.jpg?oh=c2fdf43a5a410af7584f02f8771d8f0b&oe=59227B0E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206745961749378&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-15T14:06:58+0000	1463321218	2016-05-15 16:06:58	8	16	10	0	26	16	7	9	10	0	8	0	0	0	0	2	0

I was told that the couldn t sell it because the product wasn t on file despite there being plenty of stock on the shelves and a price tag. I was given numerous excuses  but I was baffled by the excuse that its because the product is new... I have been buying this mix from your store for several months now and as other supermarkets don t stock it - I actively come to tesco to get it. I m shocked and appalled at how I was spoken to and that the price couldn t have been entered manually. Please give me answers.					2016-05-15T13:30:04+0000	1463319004	2016-05-15 15:30:04	2	6	3	0	9	6	1	5	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

The residents of Badersfield have had non stop water issues for a month now with no water pressure  which in cause has meant the majority of houses have had little or no running water or no showers for weeks. This weekend however seemed to be the worst with absolutely no running water  so not being able to wash/brush teeth or even flush the toilet. With nobody seeming to do anything to fix it  Tescos Blue Boar in Norwich this morning have turned up with a van full of bottled water to dish out to the community  with even tescos staff bringing them in their personal cars. An amazing gesture which has been massively appreciated by everyone so again a BIG Thankyou from us all xxxxx					2016-05-15T12:57:02+0000	1463317022	2016-05-15 14:57:02	195	17	205	25	247	17	8	9	10	0	194	10	0	0	0	0	0

Rather inconvenient considering it was for my sister who was at home with four unwell children and unable to collect it. However  when I called the help line to inquire where it actually was I was told they didn t know. Although they could confirm it had been delivered to a store in Portsmouth they couldn t say which. The operative I spoke to was very helpful promising he would do his best to help and call each store. He called back to inform me that the stores were not answering  which quite frankly is ridiculous and his shift had ended but he would pass it on. I have not received any further information on the matter which is extremely frustrating. The only reason I ordered from Tesco was because the TV would be delivered on Saturday to her home address and that has not happened.					2016-05-15T09:19:16+0000	1463303956	2016-05-15 11:19:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I feel not! For a company that uses the slogan  Every little helps  I think every LITTLE bit less packaging you use would HELP our environment a lot!  41 sheets of packaging paper and a box which would fit 4 of the same items in easily is a little bit too much in my opinion.

Can you please tell me why you sell your Genius GF Seeded Bread at ¬£3.00 a loaf yet my local Aldi can sell it at ¬£1.89. Either they will go out of business due to making a loss or you have jumped on the GF band wagon and are charging an extortionate price. Some of us have no choice but to have a gluten free diet and it takes a huge lump out of our food budget.					2016-05-14T21:40:38+0000	1463262038	2016-05-14 23:40:38	2	4	2	0	6	3	3	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

She wore if for a few nights and then I washed it. i have just come to use it tonight and as I went to do the press studs at the top  I noticed that the material has come away and caused three holes. I have attached a picture of the worst one  as I am unable to add more photos. I only threw the receipt away the other day when I was emptying my purse. Can you advise me what I should do now as I have a sleep bag that I am unable to use.

After setting off for our charity rally  from Norfolk to Benidorm we realised that we had forgotten the selfie stick (a vital bit of equipment for this rally). We stopped in at the Newmarket store (dressed as minions) to purchase said item. Inquisitively the manager came over to ask if he could help and ask what it was in aid of  after telling him  he donated the item for the rally. We have put the amount of the item into the charity tin  raising money for East Anglian Air Ambulance.  Once again thank you to the manager and staff of the Newmarket store for their generosity and their well wishes for our journey.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13177884_1370975566262428_3392731145685634954_n.jpg?oh=7d57cdecbcaa0c8a0db9453033ce5938&oe=59219E4D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13177884_1370975566262428_3392731145685634954_n.jpg?oh=01646db35e3677d22979d7e61852f92a&oe=59246958	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1370975566262428&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-14T20:11:06+0000	1463256666	2016-05-14 22:11:06	34	5	34	4	43	5	2	3	6	0	34	0	0	0	0	0	0

I broke my foot before coming on holiday to Sheringham - so I am in a cast for a few weeks and struggling with the crutches the NHS gave me. I haven t been able to hire a wheelchair as no where is open Saturdays.  We went to your store to buy some supplies for the week and used one of the courtesy wheelchairs in store. When we finished I was about to return the chair to the customer services I believe the store GM was there and I joked about borrowing the chair. When my wife then actually returned the chair after filling up our taxi. The lovely lady on the service desk came back out with it and asked for our details!!!   YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HELPFUL THIS WILL BE FOR US UNTIL MONDAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  #everylittlehelps					2016-05-14T19:35:13+0000	1463254513	2016-05-14 21:35:13	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The lady on the customer services desk who held my hand and gave me tissues when I cried during an anxiety attach earlier today. My car had a puncture in the car park.  Sean was without a knight in shining armour.  He talked to me gently to help calm me and told me about his sister who has anxiety   he was so very kind.  He then took me back to the car park   collected his own jack  wheel brace and air pump.  He changed my wheel swopped them around and then checked the air pressure in all my tyres because he knew I needed to feel safe. I m still feeling a little shaky but I m home safe and sound.  In a world quick to criticise I want es to compliment and thank Sean   I  don t know how I would have coped without historic help and understanding.  It s goods to know that mental health issues are already being understood by big corporate companies like Tesco.  Tesco you are fortunate to employ such a superstar as Sean.  Please arrange a pat on the back for him   he went above and beyond. It wasn t an Every Little that helped   it was enormous.

A Tesco van cut across and STOPPED in front of me on a dual carriageway this afternoon  before mounting and driving over the central reservation to go back down the other side of the dual carriageway! The driver then had the audacity to holler abusive language at ME for sounding my horn!   I feel he could have caused a serious  if not fatal accident if I d not had my wits about me. I am pregnant which made the whole episode worse for me but am thankful that I didn t have my toddler in the car. I did have a passenger witness though who was equally shocked and appalled.  Sadly the position of his vehicle didn t allow me or my passenger to get his number plate but I d recognise him again and when I do  his photo will be going to the police along with my report of his dangerous driving and law breaking. I can tell you he was driving up (and across  illegally) Abbey View in Waltham Abbey at 14.35/14.40 this afternoon.   I trust you will take a report of such an incident seriously and remind your drivers that they are not above the law.					2016-05-14T16:54:55+0000	1463244895	2016-05-14 18:54:55	0	12	0	0	12	12	11	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What I don t understand is Customer Care staff seem to be the only ones who customers contact when an unexpected problem arises. Simple advice never seems to be registered for their future reference. The appropriate contact number on your receipt received is given for a good reason.					2016-05-14T16:39:14+0000	1463243954	2016-05-14 18:39:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

First off  I can only assume a website error meant that although I got the confirmation page for my DELIVERY  I got no email and didn t realise until this morning  So I switched to click and collect. Upon arriving I had 4 substitutes.   Toothpaste was substituted to a inappropriate one - I know you stock more than one toothpaste brand Tesco!   Raspberries for blackberries - close but no cigar!  Bread - really?  Sugar - I ordered a 2kg and received a 1kg (not 2 X 1kg)  I have also arrived home to find missing items and my onions are soft and unusable.   I would phone  but the last time I had an issue I was promised a management call back and I m still waiting.....  So thanks Tesco. I ll use Sainsbury s next week.					2016-05-14T16:11:26+0000	1463242286	2016-05-14 18:11:26	0	11	0	0	11	11	3	8	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Myself and partner were purchasing alcohol and we needed iD which is understandable as we do look young. My partner was unable to provide proof of age so we were unable to get the alcohol in which I also understand due to the think 25 policy. However the lady at the checkout then refused to sell an age 12 DVD... My partner is 28 and I am 20 so I think this was a bit over the top. I asked the lady if I could run to the car to get my partners ID and I would only be a moment or 2 and she said that because she was busy I was unable to do this and would have to pay for the shopping I had and then come back in to repurchase the goods. Her attitude was awful and customer service skills were poor. I understand your staff have a job to do and accept this. However not allowing me to nip to the car and get ID and being refused an aged 12 dvd is a joke and poor reflection on the company and that store. Will not be back to this store again.					2016-05-14T15:50:52+0000	1463241052	2016-05-14 17:50:52	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can t find the right place to feedback on your website so I m going to do it here!  I was sat at your click and collect site in New Malden today (which is fabulous - I love the ladies there)  watching a man put individual items into his own bags because he didn t want to pay 40p for the plastic bags (or he cares for the environment of course which is equally possible) and it struck me that he was putting groceries from your store into competitors bags when he could have been putting them into your bags for life. I wonder if you would consider therefore setting up a scheme at the click and collect stations where customers could have the option of buying bags for life when they shop online.  You could pack the shopping into the bags for life.  Then the next time we bring back the empty bags for life and you give us the shopping in more bags for life.  And so on.  Like we used to with the milk bottles when we were kids!  I appreciate that sometimes people would forget their bags so sometimes more bags might end up out than in but perhaps it would be worth trialing.  It would probably be a scheme that people buy into rather than buying the bags individually.  The ladies at New Malden seemed to think it would make their lives a whole lot easier.  Food for thought?  And sorry if I ve put this in entirely the wrong place!					2016-05-14T14:50:21+0000	1463237421	2016-05-14 16:50:21	4	7	4	0	11	7	3	4	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

After deshelling one  the inside seemed rotten out and contained what looked like the mealworm/ maggot pictured. Not only is this absolutely disgusting but very upsetting as we frequently buy these  and raises massive concern as to the health standards of the Tesco own brand products.  Safe to say we won t be getting them anymore. Thanks Tesco!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13239383_10207854660355910_740146662656206375_n.jpg?oh=7cecdf6fe0c45031601e7af230cd948b&oe=592060A8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13239383_10207854660355910_740146662656206375_n.jpg?oh=cef1f82e54a1b56a4b6181f5a9756528&oe=58D9F4BD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207854660355910&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-14T14:45:47+0000	1463237147	2016-05-14 16:45:47	1	14	1	1	16	13	5	8	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a long time Asda customer  my husband and I switched to Tesco home delivery after a very bad experience with Asda service last week. The driver who brought my shopping in was so friendly and helpful  took the time to help with bags and ask if I was happy with the service and even got me to check my eggs to make sure there were none broken! Never once had that experience with Asda. I wish I d caught his name  but I didn t  and hope you can pass on my thanks and compliments to him and the team. Very happy and impressed customer!

The Tesco employer said to her have you ever been caught with items that you have not scanned before  implying that she had previously been stopped for shop lifting!!! THE ANSWER TO THIS IS NO!!! He then proceed to re scan all the shopping and left it to my mum to re pack!! This is not acceptable. We will be thinking twice before using Tesco again!					2016-05-14T13:40:08+0000	1463233208	2016-05-14 15:40:08	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Broke once  got it repaired  broke again  returned for a refund.  All good so far  but wait .... Having phoned customer services off we drive to the local store to return the PS4 and arrange a refund.  So a very nice lady at the local store gets onto Customer Services  who action the refund but before you can say  knife  - problem is they did it without checking with me HOW I would like the refund.  I tried to intervene  but no ... don t interrupt our process  click  it s done.  Money has been returned to the card on which you paid.  Great  but I was trying to say I don t want it refunded to that because the account is closed!     Lady at store says don t worry  check the email and you will be able to call the number on the email.  However  no number ... so another drive back to the same lady at the local store who phones Customer Services  who say they can t do anything - my Bank will have to transfer the money into the correct account. (Lady at store now embarrassed at how unhelpful Customer Services are).   Next morning I am at the Bank  who tell me they can t just transfer money from a payee to any account I say without reference back to the payee - could be fraud.  Fair enough!  (Note how reasonable and patient I am being).  I need to give Tesco the new account number  so that once the payment is bounced back to them they can pay it.   This afternoon (that s 24 hours now since problem first arose) I am on to Tesco again.   oh no  they say  we can t do anything without the previous account details.   ok  says I - I have the account number and sorting code you sent the money to.  But NOOO -  that s not good enough!  they say  we need the card number  they say.  The account is flipping closed  says I  I don t have the old card number it was destroyed.   Go back to your bank  says Tesco  they ll sort it out .  So now I am spitting feathers!  They won t budge an inch - keep passing the buck back to me.  Everyone else manages to transfer money using a sorting code and account number  but that s not good enough for Tesco apparently!   SO  now I have no PS4  no refund and will have to spend my Saturday afternoon seeing if my Bank can help me. TESCO S SUCKS!!!  I am never shopping there every again.					2016-05-14T13:34:36+0000	1463232876	2016-05-14 15:34:36	0	7	0	0	7	7	4	3	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I made a fruit smoothie for myself and my family  after I pour the fruit smoothie into a glass  my 10 year old son took a drink and found a piece of plastic in the glass  I took a drink out of my own and I also found a piece of plastic  I decided rather than drink any further I poured out the smoothies into a sieve and found loads more plastic inside the drinks. I have checked my smoothie maker to make sure that was not to blame and my smoothie maker is glass and as you can see from the photos there is no damage caused.  I wanted to bring to your attention in case further bags have been contaminated.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13239961_10154236905397502_592397755572373036_n.jpg?oh=ab16898bf40b9be18f05eed22bcbd000&oe=58D7E46E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13239961_10154236905397502_592397755572373036_n.jpg?oh=a3db1f50c51eb3b6f8a9bfe7c55ecb18&oe=5908117B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154236905397502&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-14T12:46:51+0000	1463230011	2016-05-14 14:46:51	0	7	1	0	8	5	2	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

The first time this happened I put it down to my error  however today I was convinced that I had received the green order confirmation banner last night  just after 10pm  to confirm that my amendments had been made. In order to save my sanity  I logged into your site to check the items in my delivery  and received an error message to state that the changes had not been able to be made as the order was already being processed. We contacted your Customer Services department who were extremely helpful and agreed to take our issue up with your technical teams. As agreed they then called us back  to advise that your technical team had advised that this was a  known issue  where intermittently  orders amended after 10pm which are being delivered early (10am?!) did not get updated. You can imagine how shocked I was to hear that you are aware of this issue  however still allow customers to make changes way after this time. I would be grateful of an explanation please as to why this is being allowed to happen and why you think the refund of the delivery charge and a ¬£10 voucher is satisfactory compensation for an order that clearly isn t what I was expecting.  Many thanks.					2016-05-14T10:46:10+0000	1463222770	2016-05-14 12:46:10	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

How many customers think so? Most of you. Give me  strength. You eat these open fruits immediately? I thought you would rinse them first before consumption. Obviously not especially as they have pesticides on them and many people touch them with dirty hands or even after they ve been replaced if they have been on the floor. Then you wonder why I buy packaged food and return the packaging back for recycling later.					2016-05-14T10:33:32+0000	1463222012	2016-05-14 12:33:32	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In one of the (still sealed) packs was a dead fly! I spoke to Tesco to be asked  did I have a receipt?   I did not -but I m pretty sure you can only buy Tesco Pitta Bread in Tesco - so the question of where I bought it was not really relevant. I was to to take the offending item to my nearest large Tesco (Hoover Building West London) to return it. I threw the other packets away - had gone off the idea by this point. I drove to the Tesco at Hoover and gave them the item Today I received a Tesco money card for ¬£5.00 with a patronising letter telling me to  buy something nice  with the money. I spent approximately ¬£2.00 on the pittas  and the same again on petrol returning them. I am therefore left with somewhere in the region of ¬£1.00 to buy my  something nice . I won t be using the card  I won t be using Tesco again.

He cheered up 2 small screaming people by offering them a banana to eat whilst I did the rest of the shopping. He definitely helped out this busy mumma by averting a double major meltdown.

My 16 year daughter took my 2 year old son for a short walk to the above store as she does regularly.....unfortunately he fell over outside and cut his knee very badly. She went into the store and asked if they had any plasters. The staff at the tills actually commented on how nasty the cut looked and instead of getting a first aider to help they simply pointed to where their very limited supply of medical goods were and told her she could buy a box of plasters!!!!! As the brilliant big sister she is  that is what she did but she had no wipes  antiseptic or even a tissue to clean him up. No help from the staff at all. Whilst I understand the accident didn t happen inside your shop  common decency would have been to help a small child in pain and distress Surely a sale of a box of plasters doesn t come before compassion......

I today returned a pair of shoes which have never been worn and were faulty.  I did not keep the receipt as I was not expecting to take them back.  I was treated like a criminal and eventually was told I could exchange them however my size was not in stock so I asked if I could change them for a different pair and pay the difference. At 1st they were not going to do this but then agreed.  However they would not give me a receipt so I have no proof of purchase if this pair proves to be the same standard as the others   I was told I could not have a receipt as I didn t have the original receipt .  If the way I was treated today is how you treat all your customers I am not surprised you are losing  customers					2016-05-13T18:28:17+0000	1463164097	2016-05-13 20:28:17	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So they want to rip one of their loyal customers off for an extra ¬£27 & they have the cheek to suggest they value loyalty! My advice is check before purchasing anything with them as they obviously don t care  the best Tesco Bank Insurance can come up with when tackled is the following response -    Your existing policy is underwritten by Royal Sun Alliance. However  the new quote is underwritten by Tesco. As different underwriters have different ways of calculating a risk this is why prices can differ.   I can appreciate your frustration as it s still a Tesco policy but I hope I have explained why there can be a difference between a renewal and a new policy. I would like to point out that it is not always the case that a new policy will be cheaper.   A typical response from an uncaring organisation  they don t deserve customers.					2016-05-13T15:40:03+0000	1463154003	2016-05-13 17:40:03	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s not a battery issue.   We purchased Ewan the dream sheep at the end of January in preparation for our April baby. She arrived on the 18th April and since then Ewan has been playing in her cot to soothe her.   The dilemma we have is our new born is now reliant on this sheep to sleep as it s soothing. I didn t expect the item to break it hasn t even had a months use. I can t send it back and then wait ages for a replacement. Would It be possible to send us a new one to our local Tesco and I can take the broken one in on the same day when it arrives  then there is no loss to my new born?  Thank you.

However  the majority of the processed foods you sell have ridiculous amounts of these ingredients - the salt content is particularly bad and very frightening to think that people are giving this stuff to themselves and their kids. Your raw frozen prawns have rather less salt content than your cooked frozen prawns: don t ask me for the serial number but just read a bag of each. WHY are Tesco processed foods so full of salt? Bad diet is costing the NHS a bomb. Just google some of the salt information sites and see what I mean.					2016-05-13T08:30:36+0000	1463128236	2016-05-13 10:30:36	0	8	0	0	8	8	1	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have no clue whats going on but over the past year my favourites have been disappearing. The bakery products are a shadow of what they were. A lot of products are  unavailable . I shop online and there are never any ecoupons/vouchers. If I buy 2 of the same item there is always one good date and one ok date. I was under the impression that shoppers always chose the best date (aldershot branch) As soon as my delivery saver is finished im off to sainsburys.					2016-05-13T08:23:18+0000	1463127798	2016-05-13 10:23:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He told me not to worry and that he will continue with the other deliveries  then for me to call him once home and he would come back to deliver my food. I was so taken by his kindness that on the way home that I bought some chocolates for him to say sorry. Once home I called him and he said he would be there in 3 minutes. I waited by my front door and then received a phone call. He told me he was outside. Puzzled  I explained I was also by my door. It wasn‚Äôt until he started reading out my sister‚Äôs address in Devon that I realised that not only was I late for my delivery  it was a delivery that for some reason was in Devon  not my address in London. I frantically apologised saying that it was my sister‚Äôs address. He told me not to worry and was happy to wait whilst I called her to check if she was in. Unfortunately  she wasn‚Äôt and I called back to explain. I apologised for messing things up  however  he kept telling me not to worry. I couldn‚Äôt believe just how understanding and kind he was. He then gave me help by telling me how to contact the customer services so that it could be rectified. Now I‚Äôm sitting here  with no food  except a box of chocolates meant for that lovely man. However  I‚Äôm overcome by how nice this Tesco employee was  and it‚Äôs given me a little faith in humanity. If we could all be as kind as him  the world would be a much nicer place. Thank you so very much to that incredibly nice man. Please can you try to reach this exceptional employee and thank him for me.					2016-05-12T21:51:19+0000	1463089879	2016-05-12 23:51:19	6	2	6	0	8	2	2	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been messed around by your company since the issue started. I purchased a TV from Tesco direct in December  turned it on to find my screen half pink and half black with no picture  then turning itself off. Broken by anyone s standard!! I called your fantastic (note sarcasm) customer service department for technical help and was asked to email them some pictures and they would get back to me the same day. I followed their orders  sent in some photos and waited. I received no call back or email to let me know what to do  so again i called you back to get yawned at while explaining my TV is not working  giving all of the same information I had previously given. (notes on the system may have been beneficial here) Again I am asked to send in some photos to show the issue... Do you really need me to? i sent them already!!! Finally after a long call the agent agrees to get someone to fix it  said person will be here in 2 days time I m informed. The day arrives when a repair or collection should happen ( not too sure here as your yawning boy agent did not explain much between naps)  Well... i spend all day awaiting a call from the technical department to say what time they will arrive. NOTHING! The silence is maddening  so again i am forced to call you up and ask where we stand on this issue and where said person is. This time I m told  oh that department is closed we will call you tomorrow  wait..... so i have waited all day and no-one thought to get in contact to tell me i am wasting my time. So  due to such an amazing service from yourselves i still have a non functional TV and no idea if or when it will be fixed or replaced. Thanks to the lack of customer service received from Tesco direct  i will be avoiding making any further purchases from yourselves. I would urge all others who are planning to buy anything from Tesco Direct to do the same as with service like this it has tarnished the name!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13164479_10156826108285580_8608547902760376004_n.jpg?oh=34176d05f7e9cafcccf72d4ce6ca76c0&oe=58DA0977	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13164479_10156826108285580_8608547902760376004_n.jpg?oh=0321d6ac875e8b38976d2e8cf495bf75&oe=58D65B03	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156826108285580&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-12T19:53:46+0000	1463082826	2016-05-12 21:53:46	3	4	3	0	7	4	2	2	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Totally let down by the whole situation and the way it has been handled.					2016-05-12T19:18:15+0000	1463080695	2016-05-12 21:18:15	1	14	1	0	15	14	9	5	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The store is open until 10pm so why do they deem it necessary to shut down half of the self service checkouts at 6pm. This left 4   manned   checkouts and 6 self service to deal with the entire store. It wasn t particularly busy but the queues were still 2 or 3 deep at the checkouts. Also Tesco is the only major supermarket not to offer cash back at the self service. Why is this?					2016-05-12T17:37:13+0000	1463074633	2016-05-12 19:37:13	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased 6 whole rainbow trouts and kindly asked for them to be gutted  filleted and de-Scaled. The fishmonger said that they do not do this anymore- at which point I m surprised to hear as I am at the fresh fish counter and have purchased fish before which has been prepared as I have requested. Anyway I asked him again if he can at the very least descale the fish which he replied and said they already are. I come home with my kids expecting dinner  and open the fish bag to find all the fish have their scales  extra work on top of my finishing the school run  prepping dinner in my attempt to descale  gut and fillet all 6 fishes! Thanks Tesco  your motto of every little helps really does need to be re-evaluated!					2016-05-12T16:51:31+0000	1463071891	2016-05-12 18:51:31	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have bought these for many years & always been happy with them but the last 3 weeks I think they taste different  difficult to explain how but a bit plasticy is the nearest description I can think of. I thought maybe it was a one off but 3 times I have used a bag & they have tasted the same. Not very pleasant & definitely spoiled our tea.

How anyone with an attitude like that can be employed in a customer facing role is beyond me. I was patiently and happily waiting in line at the Lottery & Tobacco counter behind a customer checking a fair number of lottery tickets  who turned to me and apologised for causing a delay. To which  June  then responded  with much attitude   Well  there are PLENTY of other checkouts open . Well  yes  there were - but I wanted to buy tobacco  as well as the box of cakes in my hand  which is only available from Tobacco counter. When my turn came  rather than an apology  I received more attitude about people  always paying for their cakes here . Well June  I m sorry if you were having a bad day which I further worsened by having the audacity to pay at your till  but really?? Poor show  Tesco. Maybe a little customer service training required?					2016-05-12T14:16:45+0000	1463062605	2016-05-12 16:16:45	0	5	0	1	6	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I opened these gluten free pitta breads yesterday to find them already mouldy 17 days before their best before date. Given your  normal  pitta breads cost 8p each and the free from ones cost 45p each I m used to having to spend more money on products but then to have that money wasted makes me very disappointed.

Your slog I here being  love food  hate waste  There are so many ways of packaging vegetables and fruit using recyclable material...or better yet...no need to package them...you don t eat the packaging and they generally go in the fridge and cold storage anyway so no need for the unrecyclable plastic for preservation or longevity. Perhaps you could look at ways of not using unnecessary packaging or using recyclable and sustainable  material and methods to package all of your name brand fresh produce and goods. You have the ability  you could set a precedent as a large chain supermarket and it is 2016.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13165984_10209271421046344_6791972340456901184_n.jpg?oh=b65078e14e0ef765aaa42a0431cbac2b&oe=58DCE15B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/13165984_10209271421046344_6791972340456901184_n.jpg?oh=f23e3dd75ee2113ffb9562df349fc330&oe=59127DAE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209271421046344&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-12T11:15:46+0000	1463051746	2016-05-12 13:15:46	11	10	11	0	21	10	7	3	13	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

All fruit I wanted wasn t sorted properly. It was that bad had to take pictures. I had to move crates and boxes and open a food trolley/crate to get fruit! until finally I found someone to help. Could have hurt my back lifting boxes.I wasted 30 mins of my life  trying to get manager and get fruit I wanted and also being told that grapes wont be in bags no more. Every  time I buy grapes and raspberries in boxes  they go off the next day and way too expensive. I ve been told to eat fruit and veg and was buying tomorrows breakfast and lunch!!!!!!!					2016-05-11T23:29:19+0000	1463009359	2016-05-12 01:29:19	0	30	0	0	30	30	3	27	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Because of a Cauliflower I got on Monday.  I buy Cauliflower and Brocolli every Monday and have noticed that the Caulies have been getting a bit smaller over the passed few weeks - doesn t usually bother me too much.  There used to be Extra Large Caulies... but no more... so be it.  Anyway  on Monday  there were about 10 caulies left in the box (I shop at around 9.30pm) so I picked one up  spread the central leaves to check that it was compact and white inside  all seemed good.  It was a lovely  heavy cauli so I was very happy.  Tonight  on preparing dinner the reality has been revealed.  I cannot return the stupid thing... we have had to eat the caulie - it was the veg for our dinner after all - but let me show you the actual size of this thing - after trimming.  The whole caulie weighed 839g before trimming.  After initial trimming it weighed 295g - then  after removing the hard central stalk... a measly 263g.  That s less than a third of the original   Surely a cauliflower of this size isn t acceptable?  I mean  it tasted fine  but how can I pay the same amount for a  normal  sized cauli for something like this?  Perhaps you should have a  Small Cauliflowers  box?  I shall attach some more pictures in the comments....	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13166055_10154676757856840_374060240567198943_n.jpg?oh=5e0c7a4a980f2b40b02e18fc9c5c529e&oe=5916B8B9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13166055_10154676757856840_374060240567198943_n.jpg?oh=f1a67bd05f1728210d324ed646ab3b56&oe=592163C5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154676757856840&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-11T19:33:08+0000	1462995188	2016-05-11 21:33:08	7	18	7	0	25	16	6	10	10	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco Club card security is just hilarious  i m surprised Tesco has not sent me code card for it and a pin and a number of other security procedures.  How many points can you actually have on card to warrant this level of  security by obscurity .  My correspondence to date lists that i have a club card  yet i have never actually been sent one and they hash out a number of the digits on the correspondence (vouchers).  I called club card services on the phone about 3 weeks ago; the first guy found my account .   Rep:   yes sir we will send out a club card to you ..  3 weeks later.  Still no club card.  I rang today and she cant find my account   i said  can i give you a grocery order number of something  she said  sorry sir we can t see that information .    How exactly is a customer service representative supposed to help a customer  if they themselves are being restricted from finding me on the system.  what information is leaked by allowing card services to lookup a club card by #order reference number..  Very inefficient folks.. i just want a club card.......... [insert random reference to dancing around campfire..]  please call me  Your grocery order number is: 347074650 					2016-05-11T19:31:49+0000	1462995109	2016-05-11 21:31:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I understand that broccoli is a vegetable  probably grown outside  and sometimes bugs and insects can get amongst them. All I ask is that you get your staff to do their upmost to check your veggies before they are plastic wrapped and sealed - I don t expect to find ONE maggot in my broccoli  much less TWO!!

I visited today around 18.00 with my 7 week old daughter and as I was putting my shopping on to the belt my daughter woke up and began screaming as she was hungry. A young man who I guess was supervising the tills as he had an ear piece in can over and approached me and asked if I needed help packing while I settled the baby. I quickly accepted and he organised another young man to help me. This lad packed my whole shop while I fed the Baby a bottle and gave everyone s ears a rest!   I would like to pass my thanks on to both of these guys as without them I would of had an extremely upset new born and you would of had some un happy shoppers listening to the baby!

Upon opening I found that they were more of a block than a flat biscuit.  In line with this the texture was more akin to shortbread  and the taste floury rather than oaty and slightly crisp.   Not good at all IMHO.  Please can you tell me if this is a deliberate space-saving change in terms of oven space  or if there is simply a rookie baker at Hawkhurst?  I really hope it s the latter or I shall have to find a new treat :-(					2016-05-11T18:36:53+0000	1462991813	2016-05-11 20:36:53	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In a sense  I am sorry to be doing this  because we all like to stay with companies we ve had good service from in the past. But in recent weeks I feel as if I ve been harassed and harangued over Tesco s seer inability to get simple grocery orders right.   It seems to matter not how often the issue is explained to store staff. They simply cannot understand that when one buys loose fish one buys it by the weight - as per the website options - and not by the number of pieces of fish.   The final straw for me came today when a member of staff from my local store (Southport) phoned so that I could explain  yet again  the simple procedure outlined above. She then kindly offered to come here and meet me with my next delivery.   Well  sorry Tesco  but there won t be a  next  delivery. I m off! Truly fed up! Had enough! Vamoose!

So I had a delivery arrive yesterday and got a  replacement  for some organic leeks that were part of a 342 deal. I ordered 1x bag 400g leeks and got 4x 500g as a replacement. Ummm  that s a lot of leeks. Way more leeks than humanly necessary and it s way too hot and steamy to make soup with them all. Can I swap said ridiculous leeks for carrots that I forgot to order please?! üòã					2016-05-11T15:38:34+0000	1462981114	2016-05-11 17:38:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was told I had to pay 5p for a carrier. The carrier would then have to be thrown as it would contain fresh meat. I have found the policy about this below  . Bags of a certain size used solely to contain packaged uncooked meat  poultry and fish: As well as the above exemption on unpackaged foods  there is no obligation to charge if the bag is used solely to contain packaged uncooked fish or fish products  packaged uncooked meat or meat products or packaged uncooked poultry or poultry products. This exemption only applies where the bag is less than 206mm (width) x 459mm (height including handles) with a maximum gusset of 125mm.  When customer service phoned the lady said it is policy to pay for carriers and I kept saying I didn t ask for a carrier but she was talking over me. Yes I got annoyed who wouldn t when a lady is speaking over me and telling me to just pay they don t give away bags even when I pointed out the policy on bags. Shame on you Tesco you make enough money out of the public without charging for small bags for fresh meat and fish. Have you advertised where you send the money you take from the carriers as I haven t seen it anywhere					2016-05-11T15:20:11+0000	1462980011	2016-05-11 17:20:11	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just thought I d share some feedback with you regarding your tesco ultra dry nappies. I ve used these on my daughter since she was 2 weeks old so have been using them for 13 months and have always found these to be the best fit etc on my daughter  have tried others which have leaked constantly or caused reactions on her bottom. They are in my opinion brilliant  you ve recently improved them too with adding stretch side tabs and making the elastic around the leg better -  massive thumbs up for this improvement to them making an already very good quality nappy even better!

I sent them a message today as I m fed up with this (their shelves are still labelled for the dozens). Their reply came by phone to say they are having a range review and will not be stocking dozens due to wastage. The result is that it is costing the customer 25p more per dozen! Definitely not fair. Tesco seem to do this with a lot of multi packs  reducing the stock so you need to buy more than one! So much for saving money at Tesco.					2016-05-11T13:37:08+0000	1462973828	2016-05-11 15:37:08	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Asda do things like caramel rice squares and raspberry crumble squares in their free from range which are vegan and Morrisons do vegan millionaires shortbread and flapjack.

Half way through eating these I noticed that the packet says  use by 08 May  Today is 11th May. Therefore this should not have been on the shelf for sale!! I am appalled that this item is 3 days out of date and still available for consumption in your store!. I suggest you speak to your staff about doing their hobs properly in the future before they seriously endanger a customer with food poisoning  particularly with dairy products.

I was shopping at around 9am this morning when my one year old decided to have a melt down and threw her dummy out of the pushchair  while going past the bakery aisle. I had no idea and wanted to get out as quick as possible so started to queue  a lady staff member called out if a dummy had been lost  I paid no attention  then she walked up to me and asked  it was my daughters  I thanked her  she told me if had been on the floor so to wash it. As I was putting the dummy away she offered to not only wash the dummy but sterilise it with water from a kettle. I thanked her again and told her not to worry as I had spares. I am so touched that one of your staff members went out if there way to help/accommodate me. I truly hope this member of staff gets the recognition she deserves.

I bought a Henry Hoover 2 weeks ago for ¬£109.00. I waited to see if the price went down for bank holiday weekend which it didn t. I have since found that Asda  the exact same Hoover for ¬£95.00! I have been back into store and asked for the different back. In my amazement your stores do not do price match on bigger items?!? Seriously? Isn t it in your best interest to do this and keep the money in your store takings?! I have since been on the online chat and have been advised that I can return the item and then purchase one from Asda !!! Then I asked about getting the cash back because I paid by card....(if I get a refund onto my card it s going to take 3-5 days to go on) and they have said no they can not do this. Now surely you want to retain the customer? I will be taking the Hoover back for a refund and will Definately think twice about purchasing big items from you again in the future!!!					2016-05-11T12:16:04+0000	1462968964	2016-05-11 14:16:04	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought these from your store in Peterborough a few weeks back and have stored them in my fridge at the recommended temperature that was stated on the packaging. The date clearly says that it is  best before 1st June 2016.  Being 3 weeks away from this date I would certainly not expect to open the packet to see mould spread across the bottom of the cheddar cheese! From the packaging I can see that you market this product at children. I could not see the mould through the plastic coloured packaging when I took it from my fridge this morning. If I gave this to my child in their lunchbox and they ate it they could potentially become ill. Luckily I can detect mould and know not to eat it; would a child aged 2-4 years old be in the same position though? I strongly believe that something should be done in terms of the  best before  dates on this product. I look forward to hearing your response to this matter.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13102855_10154113231668830_2984565589251816158_n.jpg?oh=0b95303363bc24eeaacce71f13283521&oe=58DB2F18	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13102855_10154113231668830_2984565589251816158_n.jpg?oh=18846d74a7ab1e51eb5ae8fab0e9c69a&oe=59245B15	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154113231668830&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-11T11:51:17+0000	1462967477	2016-05-11 13:51:17	12	4	12	0	16	4	2	2	2	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just letting Tesco and tesco customers know that they introduced the new  Rosedene  fruit+veg in our local tesco s  Ystradgynlais swansea. But to my shock horror I went there yesterday only to find most of the fruit and veg were put up in price compared to a few weeks ago when they introduced this brand at being  affordable  to struggling customers......for instance the blueberries WERE 89p a small punnet  raspberries WERE ¬£1.09  strawberries WERE ¬£1.09 and blackberries WERE 89p. I can t recall what the price of all had been changed to but the blueberries  my sons favourite for his fruit break in school  are now ¬£1.09 per small punnet!!! Hence I didn t buy any and WON T until the price comes back down!!! Why has this happened Tesco??? Surely the whole point of getting this make into your store was to help struggling families so why put the prices up??? If the items are a good seller  which by the way they WERE  that surely doesn t give you the right to just up them in price. Defeating the objective of supplying fruit and veg at a reasonable price!!!!??? This SHOULD NOT be allowed to happen  if its an affordable brand then it should stay affordable NOT put up in price because it sells! Very angry at TESCO!!!					2016-05-11T10:05:39+0000	1462961139	2016-05-11 12:05:39	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I caught myself on one of the brackets that holds up shelving and cut myself. here s a picture (from when I managed to stop the bleeding). I was seen to by a team leader (I think her name was mandy) and sent on my way after.   I wanted to know what you re going to do about this  since I shop with you frequently  despite Sainsbury s being much closer to home. will any action be taken for me  or to prevent other people from succumbing to further injury (p.s. my wrist now stings like hell!)

I was asked to return my slow cooker a weeks ago and I was refunded ¬£17 for the 5.5L one.  I wanted to swap this and was advised I couldn t as ALL the slow cookers had been returned to the manufacturer so I would have to wait until the faults were fixed.  I have been back to Tesco waiting for my slow cooker to become available again only to find the price is now ¬£34.50 and not the ¬£17 I was refunded!!!!!!  What an absolute joke!  I most certainly will NOT be purchasing anything from you again  especially not since an Asda has been built nearby!

I am utterly disgusted  shocked and angry about comments made by a member of your staff to my friend s mother. The incident occurred in your Hucknall store and it was concerning the sexuality of Brandon  my friend.  My friends mother  who is a regular  long-standing customer of Tesco was approached by a member of your staff who she knows  only to be told  you should feel disappointed in your son turning out gay!   I am absolutely astounded that a member of your staff who work in a big corporation would openly air their views like this. She clearly thinks this is acceptable  much to her amazement  it s clearly not.  My friend felt like he was being judged  for simply being himself  as he is doing his weekly shop with mother.  I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest inconvenience  with a comprehensive list of the action you are going to take in to the investigation around this.  Yours sincerely   Anton Cane A very angry and 20 year customer of Tesco.					2016-05-11T00:50:09+0000	1462927809	2016-05-11 02:50:09	10	28	17	3	48	27	11	16	24	0	10	0	0	0	0	6	0

I wandered the aisles aimlessly looking for a remedy  and arguably more importantly I wanted to get some well deserved respite.  As a bloke I had to do the obligatory sweep past the magazines; taking a peek at car magazines. I then pondered  and considered buying an Xbox or a Playstation; finally deciding that I couldn t make my mind up. In reality  i was only kidding myself as I thought of carnage at home  if I had returned with either. I resigned to the fact that no matter how I explained it  or how I sold it. That it was a particularly bad idea  and I might as well have signed my own death warrant. Figuratively speaking.   Looking at the time I decided that I really should start searching for the remedy for an easy life  albeit in this case a cure for the missus s sore gullet. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to decide which flavour of cough sweets would best suit the boss  and I wisely chose the cherry flavour. I figured that if she didn t like them  then I would. Not all would be lost  I felt fairly smug about my perspicacious judgment in this matter. I proceeded to choose a cake with aplomb; lavishly picking up the luxury chocolate cake. I knew that this would cheer her up no end  and as a result of this  I would have a nag-free evening in front of the telly. At this point  I thought I would over indulge with the purchase of some luxury ice cream. I carefully selected the nicest looking clotted  cornish ice cream I could find. I walked almost merrily to the tills  avoiding the self serving robots as I was pleasantly greeted by the human sitting behind the desk. She smiled and I smiled back  as I packed my bag. I thank the lady and proceeded to the car. As I left it was raining moderately  but not enough to dampen my mood.  When I got home  I played my usual childish prank. Which was to pretend that there was no cake left at the shop; bizarrely this seems to amuse me. Telling her that she will have to cherry cough sweets and ice cream for her throat  and nothing else. After a few moments  I showed her the cake. She was shocked to see that i had spent a considerably higher amount more than I usually would do on her. She was very keen for me to dish up the cake.   Now this is the single  most important part of this utterly dull and otherwise pointless story. I opened the polythene packet  and to my disgust the cake was extremely badly packaged. Enough for me to consider my chances of success. The cake was surrounded by cardboard and the bottom of the cake was covered by some sort of paper. Before I was able to plan the best course of the action  the cake was splatted on the floor. The same floor that she had spent mopping only earlier today!   What I did next Tesco  was not my proudest moment. Using the card  you so kindly provided I proceeded to scoop the cake into a bowl. I briefly checked for hairs  but concluded that it should be safe as she had cleaned the aforementioned kitchen tiles this morning. I then piled the ice cream on top  as if to hide any foreign bodies that might lurk on top of the luxury chocolate treat.   When I went into the living room  my partner who was clearly surprised by my lack of food asked  where s yours? . She was even more surprised when I replied that I didn t fancy any  but gladly she was over the moon when I informed her that their was plenty left in the fridge.   So when she went for seconds  and almost slipped in the chocolaty mush that consumed the kitchen floor. Lets just say that I didn t get the blissfully calm and relaxing evening that I had hoped for. In addition to that  the missus still has a sore throat from all the shouting she did.  I write today in relation to the packaging for this product; I feel that it is not satisfactory. In my opinion  opening a box and slicing a sweet treat  should be in theory be no more or less than  a piece of cake .  I look forward to receiving your reply  Matt					2016-05-10T23:41:17+0000	1462923677	2016-05-11 01:41:17	5	2	7	0	9	2	2	0	0	0	4	0	0	2	0	0	0

I said that there was still 7 minutes till closing time but he still said no and just walked away.

I ordered a TV last week on the 30th July and chose an order date for the following Saturday - the delivery time was 7am to 7pm which was slightly inconvenient but as a teacher I have little choice so I stayed in. As 8pm rolled in I rang to find that it was not being delivered but I would be contacted first thing Monday morning.  On Monday  I received a text saying it was being delivered which wasn t useful as I work through the day but it didn t arrive anyway - I rang again that night and was told I would be contacted the following morning which I wasn t.  I rang this afternoon during my lunch break to be told it would again be delivered today but still no TV. I m unsure what to do now - I ll call Tesco again in the morning but I m incredibly disappointed with the service and hoped for better.					2016-05-10T22:04:42+0000	1462917882	2016-05-11 00:04:42	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son is autistic and he really struggles when we shop especially the waiting at the till! I didn t manage to get his name but the man on the checkout kept my son distracted and chatted away as I packed my shopping. He also knew about autism and said some wonderful things including what a lovely young man Charlie  who s nine years old was. This was so nice to hear and made our shopping trip that little bit easier and my son walked out of your store feeling 10 feet tall! Great job and hope he gets the recognition he deserves.

Shopping due between  2 and 3  had a text saying 330 didn t arrive then she called at 345 and 430 didn t arrive. Then told chasing the driver. Then told can t get hold of driver.  Then told can t deliver as driver has worked too many hours. After most of the day on the phone a call after 730pm to say they would come in next 90 minutes. shopping comes with broken eggs and unripe fruit. My mum now can t check easily if has all the shopping because the driver took the receipt because he wasn t given a hand held machine. No compensation in any form given or even offered!!! Come on tesco sort it out!!!					2016-05-10T21:01:35+0000	1462914095	2016-05-10 23:01:35	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought I was in luck as the price was very reasonable. However. In fact the taste  texture and experience was so repugnant that I would not feed it to an animal or arch enemy. I would like to know in full why food like this is for sale when it should be clearly thrown into the refuse as it is clearly dangerous for a person or persons health. The food was so bad that I had to spit it out in public on the London Underground. I almost vomited and I still feel quite nauseous hours later. This was extremely distressing for the others. Reduced foods should not be dangerous. I have kept the remaining foods and packaging as I wish to take this matter further if need be. Please can you tell me what I should do next.  Thanks Chaz.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13133277_10153931662973891_4951887126269152877_n.jpg?oh=d936762d58e79e9ad18072b0092647a3&oe=591A64C7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13133277_10153931662973891_4951887126269152877_n.jpg?oh=5d018ac272e5225061bc54a740462138&oe=590C42B3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153931662973891&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-10T20:40:17+0000	1462912817	2016-05-10 22:40:17	3	14	4	0	18	14	5	9	2	0	3	0	0	1	0	0	0

The payment for the order was taken from my account on the 9th of may. While checking my bank account  especially pending transactions i noticed an outstanding payment taken by tesco to the value of ¬£2.  When i Spoke to your call center the girl said it was a  verification payment  that would be refunded once the actual payment has gone through........... I was not happy with that explanation as i have never paid this before  there is no advice on the website at the time of payment  nor can i find anything in your terms and conditions regarding this. I asked to speak to her manager  she initially refused but after several minutes of arguing agreed that he would call me back. I expressed my dissatisfaction regarding this matter when he bluntly told me  thats what we always do . Oddly these ¬£2 transactions do not show on my bank account??? He kept taking over the top of me in an extremely arrogant manner which led me to shout back at him  her terminated the call. If that man worked for my company  speaking to my customers in that fashion  he would in the morning be down the job centre. So  apart from this never having happened on my account before i also wonder why the payment for the delivery has already been processed but the ¬£2 transaction still is pending  it should have been completed and refunded at the same time as payment was taken  or the ¬£2 could have been deducted from the final balance!					2016-05-10T20:38:21+0000	1462912701	2016-05-10 22:38:21	1	6	1	0	7	6	5	1	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter purchased a playstation 4 for her birthday in March 2016 and it started to overheat and switch off. She rang Tesco Yeading to be told is nothing to do with them and to call Sony. I don t believe that is correct as the contract is between Tesco the seller and my daughter the buyer and any faults regardless of what sony has in place Tesco has a responsibility to make it good through repair in reasonable time.

I got a weeks worth of food that went out of date today and tomorrow !! I know have no way to get to a shop as I live in middle of nowhere with no shops at all . I don t drive and there is no public transport and registered disabled in a lot of pain  . I have a 1 year old daughter I cannot feed as I ve had to send the food back . The refund for the food and the good will gesture amount to nothing as I cannot make another order without spending ¬£40 to get it ! I am not you dustbin ! How am I meant to feed my daughter ?!! Let alone myself . I even wrote on the notes of my order   no short dates   I should not have to come into store to make sure I get food that is in date . I should not be subjected to your pickers finding the stock that is going out of date and giving it to me so you don t loose money and I do instead . It s hard enough being a disabled mother and looking after myself and my daughter without you making it harder by going out of your way to send out of date food . The dates that where written on the receipt didn t even match the dates on the food . The receipt said the 11-13th yet half went out today and bare in mind I have recieved my order at 8pm the rest went out tomorrow . The bits I ve had to keep to feed my daughter go out of date by the 13th . This was meant to be a weeks shop . On the food I picked it had 4+ days or so on stating these products would last . Yet I receive the stock that should have been binned today or reduced for those who don t mind to pick up . You should not advertise that it has a set amount of days before it goes out on your page and not stick to it . You should not use deliveries as a way to get rid of out of date   short date stock . There are many people like me who depend on this service to have food in there homes as live in remote areas . The closest thing to me is a garage ! They do not even sell food let alone food I could feed my daughter . This is not the first time either ! It is the third !!! The first time I accepted a refund for the out of date product   then for a while things where fine . The second time I was given a refund for the product and then the ¬£40 voucher to make up for the trouble you caused and so I could feed my daughter . Then again after things where fine until again it has been repeated . It was in the news recently how this was being done and it was not acceptable yet you have continued to do so ! I have bought things that where in date date wise yet still off . This is not acceptable					2016-05-10T19:50:55+0000	1462909855	2016-05-10 21:50:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday we made the trip to your store in Alfreton  Derbyshire to pick up what my son  who has a diary allergy  calls  his special yogurt   Usually we buy the Alpro yogurt  but instead yesterday we came across your own brand and decided we would try it. Silly me made the rookie mistake of not checking the use by date on said yogurt  stupidly thinking that you have staff that are paid to stock rotate and remove out of date items.   Although dairy free foods are becoming more widely available  popping to the local shop to pick up a replacement yogurt is not possible. Therefore this evening we have had floods of tears from my son who doesn t want to  wait until tomorrow  for his yogurt.   I am sure you will advise me to return this item to the store I purchased it from for a refund / exchange  however in all honestly we only really make the trip to Tesco every 2-4 weeks for any  free from  items we may need. So just popping back isn t or an option until at least the weekend when we are not at work and school. I m therefore hoping to persuade my little boy to try our  in date  jelly.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13177506_10154262184448474_3894843818883679550_n.jpg?oh=f0aae03d9cd3ac53a7141e503cf57157&oe=58DC4520	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13177506_10154262184448474_3894843818883679550_n.jpg?oh=b7629f48f4b8ce7c5f362dcc22218ced&oe=591CE82D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154262184448474&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-10T18:06:02+0000	1462903562	2016-05-10 20:06:02	6	8	11	0	19	8	2	6	4	0	5	0	0	0	0	5	0

Panicking that my car wouldn t get any further I managed to get to the Tesco in Cardigan (car was now jittering!) but my card did not work for Pay at Pump. I went into the store to find help and Mags Lawson and Olwen Davies behind the Customer Service Desk were excellent. Mags offered to ring her husband for him to take me the rest of the journey and Olwen called the duty manager  Sarah Morgan to see what help they could give as I was stranded. I was able to get cash back in the store and Olwen walked over to the PFS with me and used her own card to fill up my fuel and I gave her the cash. I am a manager with Tesco and it made me proud when I was offered so much help from these very lovely ladies. I hope that all 3 of them can be given a values award for the excellent and professional service which they gave me and also calmed me down. Many thanks!					2016-05-10T16:21:51+0000	1462897311	2016-05-10 18:21:51	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I d like to ask if anyone who works at that store or the ones in charge of trolly maintenance has ever had to push a disabled 5 year old who almost constantly rocks back in forth and flails about in a half working trolly? The straps to buckle him in were frayed and broken! I couldn t even secure him in. The wheels were next to useless as any hope of turning the trolly was near impossible. Parts of the padded seat were torn open. It was a mess pretty much. I had no hope of putting him in a regular trolly as he is too large.  I was so happy to see these trollies become available to Tesco shoppers but sadly today that happiness was ruined as well as the shopping trip.  I appreciate that wear and tear is unavoidable but the state this one trolly is left in is deplorable. It s the ONLY disabled children s trolly in this shop and sadly you have failed anyone who is needing to use it. You have done your part to provide it but clearly the customer service doesn t go beyond that.					2016-05-10T15:50:06+0000	1462895406	2016-05-10 17:50:06	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So Tesco s also have the rule that you need to remove your helmet before fueling  even though they will not ask for a female to remove a Berka before fueling. Double standards Tesco s.  What s the next rule you will bring out for bikers ! No fuel unless your wearing a HI Vis.					2016-05-10T15:31:21+0000	1462894281	2016-05-10 17:31:21	0	11	0	1	12	11	6	5	26	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got to the checkout and discovered I had left my purse at home so one of your staff put my trolley away safely till I came back. Another pushed my trolley for me when I returned (I had my baby in a car seat)  someone opened a checkout for me. They both helped me load the food on the belt and into bags and then one got me a new trolley so I could put the baby on too. After I d loaded my car another member of staff took the trolley away for me. Please pass this on to the manager of the store  it s something they should be commended for as they really helped ease my misery at having to go home etc. Thank you :)					2016-05-10T14:15:03+0000	1462889703	2016-05-10 16:15:03	3	2	3	2	7	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought some swimwear from your store in Banchory a few days ago. I took it home to try on as there are no changing rooms in store. Unfortunately  it didn t fit  so I decided to return it  only to be told that I was unable to return it due to  a change in policy . As I understand it  you no longer accept returns on swimwear. I was careful not to remove the hygiene label from inside the swimwear as  on the label  it clearly states that refunds will not be given if removed. This is clearly a contradiction to your new policy as you now won t accept returns full stop. I pointed this out to customer services who politely agreed with me  and further  when I stated that there were no signs informing me of this new policy anywhere in store  they hesitantly agreed. I had to go to great lengths to get a refund (which was reluctantly agreed to) and i m really quite irritated by this. I really love Tesco clothing  but this has really disappointed me. How many people have accepted this new policy  and are left feeling ripped off? I spent ¬£16 on swimwear which I couldn t try on  only to be told there was  nothing they could do  when I asked for a refund. An exchange was also out of the question. I notice that this isn t clearly stated on your website either  but I don t know whether this is due to distance selling or not. Sort it out  Tesco!

I bought these on Saturday (7th) with a Best Before date of 11th.  Not really looking too hot on the 9th are they??  This is on top of bread that only lasts a few days (Warburton s from your store is nowhere near as fresh as the Co-op down the road) you have stopped selling the yogurts I use  I now have to go to Morrison s for Danone Shape yoghurts AND you promoted Rankin fruit load for a few weeks  making a big deal of a display  and now DONT STOCK IT!  What on earth was the point of a promotion if you re not going to stock it??  My wife is eating very little at the moment due to illness  and this was one of the few things that actually gave her an appetite!  Thanks for your help...

The nursery have set up a just giving page and Simon Has contacted the nursery offering a great donation from the store for the nursery to buy New outdoor toys for the children. This is what makes Tesco a million miles above the rest. Managers like Simon are a real credit to you supporting the local community like this.

Last week I was called  to arrange a delivery.  The arranged day was today  Monday 9th May. I was told I would receive a call on Friday with a three hour time slot.  I did receive a call from an automated system on Friday however on answering the phone the time slot was not legible and there was no option to repeat the message. I then called customer services on Saturday to find out the delivery slot   I was told they would contact the courier and call me back.  Noone called back. I called again this morning and was told my delivery slot was 1500-1800 today.  At 1830 I phoned again as my drier had still not arrived. I was told that they didn t know why my drier had not arrived and they couldn t get hold of the courier so there was nothing they Could do except e mail the courier and wait for them to contact me.  So as it stands tesco have ¬£450.00 of my money   I have not received my drier and have no idea where it is our when it will arrive and you have now left it up to the courier despite having taken my money!  I took a day off work today   I can t take another day off so what am I meant to do now? After being letdown by hotpoint with my previous dryer I decided to order through tesco instead as I have always been a loyal customer.  So disappointed that I have wasted a very rare day off work and essentially been fobbed off.					2016-05-09T21:27:28+0000	1462829248	2016-05-09 23:27:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It wasn t stocked at that store so I went to the order point for next day delivery to a store near where I work. That store (Falkirk Grahams Road/Retail Park) was not listed under that address but stores in Birmingham came up.  I asked a nearby assistant for help and he couldn t understand it and got his manager to look at it. The store we were in came up but said it was 2.9 miles away! I think your system could do with an update  as well as the console itself  you have to press really hard on the screen to get it to do anything. I ve since ordered what I needed online  however probably too late for next day delivery now.					2016-05-09T20:58:10+0000	1462827490	2016-05-09 22:58:10	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I took one of the freezer (as you do) and as I took my first bite  my tongue and lips got completely stuck to the lolly  causing me to rip them off causing a lot of bleeding to my lips and tongue  with my top lip still bleeding 2 hours later! I took the box out of the freezer and it says in small text at the BACK of the box that they should be left out of the freezer for 5 minutes before consuming....what kind of lolly has to be left out for a certain time duration before they are consumable! I think this WARNING should be on the FRONT of the box in BOLD text for all parents to see before giving one to their small children! I m just so glad my toddler hadn t tried one before me! I hope what happened to me tonight doesn t happen to any child out there!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13178919_10156841467915137_264924842270128305_n.jpg?oh=2f48055e7900a36be1e2ba3815b2f14f&oe=5924C7E8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13178919_10156841467915137_264924842270128305_n.jpg?oh=b82c2e1e2678214204e80edc23bd64d0&oe=59071AFD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156841467915137&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-09T20:38:16+0000	1462826296	2016-05-09 22:38:16	2	7	2	2	11	7	1	6	11	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

For some reason the management of this store like to keep these checkouts closed (probably because they want to force people to use self-service checkouts).  The store is so badly designed  that if you enter one end and want to exit the other  you have to walk half way in the opposite direction of the exit you want  to reach a checkout. The store itself is a disaster when it comes to the layout  it was refurbished and all the aisles made narrower  apart from the freezer aisle which is double the width of the other aisles.  For some reason people always seem to stop for a chat by the fresh bread  so there is normally a blockage of people  pushchairs and trolleys.  The stock on the fresh bread is often quite empty  you can see the bread  cakes and rolls waiting to be put on display and I now go into the bakery and ask for what I want. Perhaps less freebie weekends away for the management and more staff could be the answer.					2016-05-09T19:24:38+0000	1462821878	2016-05-09 21:24:38	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Especially at the Leigh store! Yesterday I got my car extensively keyed whilst shopping in store. I private messaged the customer service team who responded very quickly and advised me to go in the store to discuss the issue. I spoke with Mo and Jo who were so helpful and lovely to speak to. Mo took all my details accurately  sympathised with me and contacted John one of the deputy managers. All three staff agreed with how bad the damage was! John took me outside and asked me to show him where I was parked. Even though the car park at leigh does not belong to you and I know you aren t liable for anything that happens he said he would trawl through all the cctv footage and do his upmost to try and find the culprit! This is going above and beyond for your customers and I really really really appreciate it!! Thank you for being so understanding and so helpful! And to top it off John gave me these beautiful flowers! Give them a well deserved bonus! Thank you again! üòäüëçüèºüëåüèºüíô	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13164237_10208767291795415_6648460989362362475_n.jpg?oh=388e58d8dd5b24157ea3f07e63131ecd&oe=58D9F2C5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13164237_10208767291795415_6648460989362362475_n.jpg?oh=550d328ec74b9e7a64ad1514fc95ba14&oe=590B0FC8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208767291795415&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-09T19:16:49+0000	1462821409	2016-05-09 21:16:49	23	8	24	1	33	8	3	5	6	0	23	1	0	0	0	0	0

However just like last year  I open it to see I have a pot of milk! Refrozen ice cream has a horrible texture and I have read many a horror story about eating re frozen ice cream due to bacteria - and I am pregnant!! - so this will only be going in the bin!

I could substitute with Willow Farms  products.. Last week I had the same issue and my shopping arrived without the mince I had ordered. So.. I had to go to my local farm shop where I bought the same product  fresh from the farm for the same price! I use Tesco for the convenience  but it is not convenient if I have to go and buy the things that don t get delivered from my local Sainsbury s. I am annoyed because I have just subscribed for a further year s Delivery Saver. Tesco... if you can t actually supply what I order  meaning I have to go out shopping anyway  it is utterly pointless using your service!!					2016-05-09T16:49:03+0000	1462812543	2016-05-09 18:49:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have kept the pack of crisps  and the main packaging and can provide this to you if required and drop it off at my local store.  I also would like to raise an issue with these crisps. I go through a number of these packs each week which I purchase from your East Dereham store. Over the last 18 months I have often come across packs that have split open which cannot be eaten. I have seen the way they are put on the shelf and the staff just push them onto the shelf without taking much care  thus causing split packs. Can this please be addressed at this store as over the last 18 months I have thrown away well over 100+ packs of crisps due to them being split open. Many thanks.					2016-05-09T15:39:29+0000	1462808369	2016-05-09 17:39:29	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

In Haydock as I struggled to the checkout with my very unhappy two month old daughter  a member of staff very helpfully insisted upon unloading  scanning and packing my shopping for me and was incredibly friendly.   In Prescot  after another costumer rudely shouting and hammering on the door of the baby changing room while I was trying to feed my baby (making me have to stop as it made me and my daughter very anxious)  a staff member in the opticians where I had my appointment offered me the examination room to feed my baby in private and made sure we were not interrupted. She also made sure my baby was ok while I had my eye test.   These simple yet kind gestures mean so much to a new mum who is still trying to figure out how to manage appointments and shopping with a baby. It makes the experience so much easier and I m very grateful that tesco staff are so kind and helpful.					2016-05-09T14:50:50+0000	1462805450	2016-05-09 16:50:50	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Told I d be called first thing this morning and that I should have had delivery by the 3rd. Still no call. Phoned again but still no answers.

If it wasn t for the fact that it was in the sale and now everywhere else has put the price up then I d be telling them where to shove it.

I called the shop on my return home to discuss this and no one answered  so I left a message requesting some one call me back. I ve still had no contact.  I am not prepared to travel all the way back to the store for something probably considered trivial however I m not impressed with how the assistant served us and think he should of made sure he gave us all our shopping as paid for.  Could someone please contact me regarding this issue. I still have the receipt and you have the goods.

It s a double shame when you fill out a customer survey online singing the praises of said member of staff they still DON T get to know of it. Come on Tesco sort it out.

Second time I ve come back from Tesco with mouldy bread in less than a month!   I have so much work to do that I don t have time to go back and fix this instore at the moment. Or go out and get some more.  Very disappointed. Once is a slip up but twice in such a short space of time means I will probably be shopping somewhere else from now on. And letting my friends and family know as I am now rather concerned about Tesco food hygiene and packaging practices...

I went here yesterday  afternoon and for the 6th time in a few weeks  I found out of date gluten free items on the shelf.  I took 2 packets of crumpets to the checkout   they are scanned and I am asked to pay ¬£4 for them   even though they are out of date!  After pointing this out to the assistant   who is polite and helpful   the  Team Leader  is called.  I tell them that I have spoken to members of staff about this recurring problem on at least 4 different occasions.  Unfortunately  I was talking to someone who was  not only unfriendly   rude and confrontational but also completely unhelpful. Even though I suggested that someone needed to speak to the staff  who were doing the reductions in order to prevent this continuously happening   I was at no time given even the slightest indication that anything was going to be done to rectify this  problem.

I followed the lady into the store so I just thought I best tell her  maybe they didn t realise what they d done (easily done I suppose)  so I actually said  not sure if you ve noticed but you ve parked in a parent and child space   her reply was  well when you ve got bad legs you park were you can ... My reply  oh I see  well I have a heavy car seat with a baby  I ll be sure to take a disabled spot next time I m here  her reply  you can get done for that  ... My reply   oh ok I best not then... You know there are spaces outside that are located closer than the space you re in now ?.... I wonder if they re worried about scratching their New VW Golf (2016 reg)... If you re concerned about her legs  don t worry she managed to walk into the store completely unaided  no limp or anything... So that s good news....üòÄ I made the couple aware that I d told customer services about their parking error and they said  Good .... So they were happy about that üòÄ Delightful couple üòÄ  I m not a moaner but it really hacks me off  when I visit the store child free (this is rare lol) I park in a normal space to free up the others for families that need them....

At my local shop there are at least 3 types of sun hats for baby horror with at least 10 of each   so I don t think it s a case of running out.  The youngest sun hat for a boy was 3-6 years.  they had the cotton fitted hats but no sun hats at all. They re not just to make baby girls look pretty   all babies wear them to keep the sun off their head and out of their eyes!					2016-05-09T09:59:18+0000	1462787958	2016-05-09 11:59:18	0	13	0	0	13	13	5	8	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

First the tension rod for the enclosure snapped and then the pole caps for the enclosure snapped. When I returned to store I discovered I should have had a spare parts bag in my box containing another pole cap but I don t seem too. It has made me concerned that whilst my children are playing on it something else will snap ! The store I bought from were very helpful and reissuing parts from other boxes but it took us over 2 days to get the thing together because we had to return to the store we bought it from not once but twice ! We now might as well have spent the extra money on a larger trampoline as we have had to use fuel to travel back to your store twice !					2016-05-09T09:25:20+0000	1462785920	2016-05-09 11:25:20	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a trampoline for my daughters birthday which is tomorrow to be told before ordering and afterwards that the latest it would be delivered is today. After having no correspondence from yourself or the delivery company I phoned up to be told that there is nothing they can do and that it is with yodel. I have phoned up yodel to be told that tesco have given them a delivery date of Wednesday. Really bad customer service from your advisor who couldn t get off the phone quick enough. If I had known the parcel wouldn t have come before my daughters birthday I would have ordered else where. Last time I make the mistake of ordering from tesco.					2016-05-09T09:11:09+0000	1462785069	2016-05-09 11:11:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At the selfservice checkout I asked for a single use bag. I didn t enter the bag at the end of the transaction as the law in Northern Ireland states that charges do not apply when purchasing raw meat  prepacked or otherwise  raw fish  hot food takeaway and medicial supplies. As I was leaving the checkout a member of staff pounced on me for now paying for the bag. I explained the excemption to the law but he stated he was not aware of this. He went to another member of staff who also stated she was not aware of this exception. So I stood there while your staff debated a 5p charge. I was made to feel like I was trying to steal a bag and avoid a 5p charge. you need to make your staff aware of the law to prevent them making mistakes that cause your customers embarrassment. It s a shame your staff have so little to do. Should this happen to me again I will take the matter to your CEO.					2016-05-09T09:05:38+0000	1462784738	2016-05-09 11:05:38	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I then got home to see my items wasn t there obviously it was after 4 and your all closed so waited till this morning did the school run sweating like a dog fur on my teeth and dry sore lips to then phone tesco again for her to say sorry there s no notes on your account to say anything is missing so now she has refunded my money which then takes 4-5 working days to show in my account so if I was on breadline and had no other spare cash I would have to have gone 4-5 days without brushing my teeth or using deodorant in this bloody weather !!!!!					2016-05-09T09:01:41+0000	1462784501	2016-05-09 11:01:41	0	2	0	1	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went and bought three large packets of these nappies on Friday because they ve always been fine  but if this is going to be a regular problem overnight then I ll have to take them back! I have had others mention the splitting to me but as they were using smaller sizes I hoped I would be OK. Can the nappies be changed back to the old ones? They were far more reliable!

But I went into clowne tesco on Saturday the 7th may and to my utter shock they have NO scooters and only wheelchairs. If I m on my own that s no good to me. Am I supposed to get one of your staff to push me around with one of those cold metal basket trolley things that clip on. The last time I did this with an inexperienced wheelchair pusher I was in so much pain from being bashed with the trolley thing I swore never again. I was very very disheartened and so the next day I could not have a day of rest I had to go to asda as it s nearer and they had a trolley. Please think of us disabled people who don t want to use a wheelchair and depend on someone to go shopping.					2016-05-09T00:04:34+0000	1462752274	2016-05-09 02:04:34	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in asking for somewhere to feed my baby. I was told straight away I could feed anywhere.  And in the cafe there was comfy seats and microwaves and stuff. I explained I Breast feed  and asked if there was a more private place I could feed due to what I was wearing I wouldn t of been able to be discrete. I was shown to your baby changing room. The member of staff made sure there was a chair and offered myself and my older daughter a drink!!! She came back with a complimenty bottle of water for both of us!!! And said to let her know I d I needed anything else!!!  I wasn t even shopping in store I had come in as specsavers had said I couldn t feed in there!!  Yet I was made more then welcome and so well looked after. I forgot to catch the women s name. She had a long ponytail and glasses and was on the tobacco counter. Around 12:30 this afternoon.  Thank you tesco ‚ò∫‚ò∫					2016-05-08T21:36:17+0000	1462743377	2016-05-08 23:36:17	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I purchased a bottle of quite expensive Gin and placed it in the boot of my car.  It fell over on my journey and due to a faulty seal  the cork came out and that was that.  I took the bottle back today not really expecting a positive outcome  but how wrong I was.  The staff didn t take up my offer to inspect my boot (gin soaked carpet).  They made no fuss at all and changed the product for me.  Great customer service  a credit to you!					2016-05-08T21:18:49+0000	1462742329	2016-05-08 23:18:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had cut my foot on some broken glass outside of the store and had gone in to buy wipes and plasters. He saw the blood (only a small cut!) and immediately got the first aid kit enabling me to clean it up. All the while still keeping an eye on what was going on at the tills.  Never got his name  but just wanted to say how friendly he was. Well done tesco on great customer service.					2016-05-08T20:04:42+0000	1462737882	2016-05-08 22:04:42	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Especially when it costs me a 5r to get to work for one day and 17 for a week coz they  dont have any tickets  despite them having a machine that prints them. And over charged evertime.

There were gristle and hard bits in them which was very off putting. We bought 8 in total  several people didn t finish theirs and we threw the rest away. I am very surprised at this  as when I buy your steak mince we never have that problem  so I m assuming that the meat in your finest burgers isn t as good a quality as your steak mince?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13177135_10154199862219640_6504026430667187970_n.jpg?oh=d6f671da30c68ff645c4d11e7ec19d98&oe=590E7C43	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q82/s720x720/13177135_10154199862219640_6504026430667187970_n.jpg?oh=5960add9459f3d516670c90c017067fd&oe=5920A6D2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154199862219640&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-08T16:05:38+0000	1462723538	2016-05-08 18:05:38	2	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

When  it arrived two of the parts were missing and two were damaged. Following the instructions in the box I ordered spare parts direct from Keter. The courier couldn t find my house so the parts were out for delivery for over a week with a delivery estimation time of between 8am and 7pm each time. I realise this part doesn t involve tesco.  However when I opened the package of spares...guess what... two of the parts were broken and two of the parts were missing. The broken parts were also filthy and looked second hand.  I m not waiting around again for days on end for  a redelivery. This thing was expensive.  I want a refund from tesco. The parts should ve been in the box to begin with and I m not paying to return the item because none of this was my fault. Had the item been in tact and all parts there i would ve kept it.  Please advise how I can get a refund without paying for delivery. It s not feasible for me to get this to a store either  hence why I had it delivered to begin with.

My partner picked up a glass bottle of olive oil and the bottom fell out it.  Now I understand that this is no ones fault.  The oil went all over my partner and covered the bottom of my jeans.  A member of staff came over then left to get someone to clean it.  We were standing about with oil dripping of him for about 5 min.  He ended up having to walk half way down the shop to the toilet.  The staff member came back with nothing to help him clean the oil off.  The deputy manager then came and I ask if I could get something to clean my hands  jeans and trolley as everything was covered.  She came back with a tiny pack of wipes.  We were then told that we could go back down to customer services to get forms to claim back money for dry cleaning which we have to pay for first.  Not even a  I ll get the forms for you .  It was embarrassing enough without walking half way down the shop to customer service.  Our bags for live were covered so couldn t use them and we were told  well you can get bags when you pay for your shopping I just think the customer service was terrible and they weren t bothered the mess we were in.  All in all shorts are ruined  trainers  my jeans as the oil won t come out.  I don t think it s right that we must get it dry cleaned and then claim the money back.  We are loyal customers and shop here every week.  All we wanted was good customer Service.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13100728_988442647920703_7231978932180321256_n.jpg?oh=7873006df0b02db6a5306f4a30f64d2c&oe=59213394	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13100728_988442647920703_7231978932180321256_n.jpg?oh=d144a6a9991b57a64484004e935cc599&oe=590DC36B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=988442647920703&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-08T15:05:55+0000	1462719955	2016-05-08 17:05:55	0	8	2	0	10	8	3	5	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

I had my son with me who was so upset that I didn t have enough money to get it for him. Why won t you match the price online?

It only cost ¬£4 but I am quite shaken up as it exploded in my hand.  I washed it with fairy liquid and warm water before filling it as per the instructions and it was fine until I took the cup part off which is the lid to make a drink and then the entire thing shattered and boiling water leaked out all over my foot well and burnt my hand.   The glass shattered inside and with such force it broke the base. I was so scared it frightened me and burnt me. I also had to dispose of my car mat in the footwell of my car for fear glass shards may have been embedded in the wet fabric. I m really upset and shaken up.					2016-05-08T11:53:48+0000	1462708428	2016-05-08 13:53:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s bad enough going on a Sunday as it s exceptionally busy  but worse when you are dragging a foot high 2 year old dictator who is started getting bored/has only any interest in causing carnage and screaming. It was during one of these  episodes  in our 2 hour visit  one of your delightful staff  a manager called Emma offered said monster an ice cream. She asked first if it was OK and returned with a packet of walls mini milks. She then proceeded to coax my little princess into the trolley with said ice cream meaning I finished my shopping quicker. Life saver. Absolute angel. Cannot thank her enough. She is an absolute credit to your company. I don t know if this feedback gets some sort of bonus/reward scheme but she rather deserves it so please consider. Grocery shopping on a Sunday with a 2 yr old leaving happy. Yes HAPPY. Now if I can employ her as some sort of personal shopper every time we go that would be fabulous...					2016-05-08T11:46:53+0000	1462708013	2016-05-08 13:46:53	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Scan as you shop to me was sold as making things quicker and easier  however this was a joke.

The past three online shops that I ve had delivered whereby I ve ordered the above has resulted in them being chucked in the bottom of a crate and subsequently exploding all over my other groceries  the carrier bag and my kitchen floor! üò© The drivers have always been very apologetic and refunded me for the damaged items and anything else covered in dairy products but it means I m then without that item and the poor drivers spent 20mins cleaning his van. Making him late for his next drop.....Not fun all round!! üò° Problem is I m not sure where the blame lies - is it the packers fault just lobbing them in? Is it the drivers fault chucking the crates about? Or is just the crappy packaging that they are in?  I really feel you need to evaluate your packaging or the way these items are delivered (ie: in a box on their own?) on things like this because quite frankly it s becoming a joke!

Had my eyes tested  and paid a small fortune for 2 pairs of varifocals. I used them for a few weeks. In that time  I wouldnt have recognised my own daughter standing next to me  my vision was so poor. But I persevered with them.Went back to the store and spoke to a different opticion. She retested my eyes  and found the prescription was completely wrong. To your credit  they were replaced. January this year I had a test again. Told I needed stronger glasses  which I got. Been trying to use them  but vision is blurred and I get constant dry eyes and headaches. Now using the old glasses and sight is much better. So I now have new glasses that are unwearable  and cost loads of cash. Needless to say I wont be using Tesco Opticians again.					2016-05-08T09:41:46+0000	1462700506	2016-05-08 11:41:46	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s lovely being woken up by one of your delivery drivers at 7.15 on a Sunday morning when you re hoping for a lie in on a day of rest. My neighbours normally get their delivery at this time  I am well aware of this fact  but this morning whomever was driving van KY64UVZ  Chatham  Kent needs to be spoken to about early morning etiquette.   I didn t hear anything until a massive bang which startled me  it was followed shortly after by another crash  it turns out he had gotten one tray of goods out and thrown it on his metal trolley and then another out and thrown that on top. He proceeded to do this for all of the delivery throwing the plastic trays around slamming them on the concrete and on top of each other (which needless to say probably didn t do the food much good). This was then shortly followed by him shutting the back door which seemed like he was trying to do it as loudly as he could and him bringing down the sliding door of his van as if he were trying to break it off its hinges. I know it s possible to close it in a quieter manner  after all I never normally get woken by it. After all this was finished everything was slung back in to his van with another massive clatter and the doors shut in the same manner before he drove away. Thanks for being my alarm clock and getting me ready to face the day  after all Every Little Helps!					2016-05-08T06:37:36+0000	1462689456	2016-05-08 08:37:36	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter was delighted with the  grown up  chat they had and it was really lovely to watch and listen to!

Yet again I failed to check out the use by dates on my meat purchases and discover that 2 of the 3 tesco meat products go out of date tomorrow !!! This is the case with 75% of the time and you shouldn t have to check the bbd on your purchases and it s down to alot of things starting with poor stock control and using the dated attitude that they will loose a sale because if it s not in Stock people won t choose something else which isn t true and leads to massive waste when it doesn t sell. When you shop at the other places like lidl iceland farmfoods and aldi ect you don t have the same problem and it s because people aren t viewing them as a cheap and nasty alternative anymore because the quality of products is equally as good and their policies are becoming better than yours are. I imagine that this post will be deleted because it seems like im promoting other companies but I m not im pointing out an issue that you have in your store and the more people I speak to about it the more I find have the same issue and are voting with their purses. I believe it s time that you spoke to your   regular   shopper about Various things rather than paying a company to get some statistics when it s in said companies interest to give good feed back to you. I don t want to come across as a miserable disgruntled customer I would actually like to help rectify some flaws that I find most shoppers in our are agree with.

He was at Prevail skatehouse this morning  where my son s friend got injured  by his scooter taking a rather large chunk out of the side of his leg. Matt showed enormous maturity for a 17 year old  and dealt with the situation so well. It was quite traumatic for my son s friend  and Matt kept him calm during the whole time and even took his own time to go to the hospital with him. He then made sure that he left the hospital on time to ensure he got to work at Tesco s in Poole after this eventful morning - all the staff have a duty of care for their customers  but Matt went above and beyond this today. He was so caring  kind and thoughtful  it would be great for him to be recognised for his efforts today  as I know that he values his job at Tesco and wishes to progress up the career ladder. I would like to say a big thank you to him  he really deserves to do well.					2016-05-07T20:34:29+0000	1462653269	2016-05-07 22:34:29	9	2	9	0	11	2	1	1	0	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve always been super happy with the varieties and the amount of sparkle! Imagine my horror this evening when I opened a bottle of sparkling orange and passion fruit to find no sparkling! Shocking! Still flavoured water is definitely the consolation prize. Alas. I will be back and buying more this was just incase anyone else had lost there fizz. üòÄ					2016-05-07T20:09:20+0000	1462651760	2016-05-07 22:09:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Did a child s party today and everything out for all the children was gluten  wheat  dairy and soya free. None of the children commented it was weird and both my son and another child were fully included and no need to have different food to everyone else. They all loved the fruit split lollies especially. Only complaint was your balloons were super tough to inflate and all popped within minutes of being blown up.					2016-05-07T19:32:30+0000	1462649550	2016-05-07 21:32:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to publicly request that you either a) increase the number of double seated trolleys that you have available or b) require a pound to be inserted to release them in Tesco Bradley Stoke  Bristol.   I have a three year old partially sighted autistic son and a one year old daughter and near enough every time I go to Tesco I have to wait 10-15 mins at customer service while the kind hearted staff trawl the car park looking for a double seated trolley for me. It s either that or carry both my children around the car park myself along with my bags while I look for one myself.   My son is unable to walk around Tesco while I do a full food shop for our family of six and my daughter is too old for the lie back version seat  so it s impossible for me to shop without a double seated trolley.   Customer services tell me because these trolleys are free (they don t require a pound to release them)  people use them frequently when they don t have a pound then leave them in the car park trolley bays. As there is not many of them there are hardly ever any at all in either of the shop front trolley bays. I would happily put a pound in if it meant the trolleys would be available.   I urge other parents with more than one young child from Bradley Stoke and the surrounding areas to back me on this request please! There are loads of trolleys with one seat  and loads of trolleys with a reclined baby seat and a toddler seat but only a handful with double toddler seats.   I note that Tesco in Crawley has also introduced trolleys with child seats for older children with difficulties such as autism. Perhaps you could consider this too?  Please note that I do greatly appreciate the efforts of the staff in Tesco Bradley Stoke as they are always sympathetic and tremendously helpful.   Thank you so much for your time.					2016-05-07T19:16:42+0000	1462648602	2016-05-07 21:16:42	67	29	68	9	106	29	15	14	22	0	67	1	0	0	0	0	0

I m ashamed and mortified to say that I lost my son in store there this evening (around 5:45pm ish)  -  I let him go to the men s toilets whilst I took his little sister the the girls  rightly or wrongly going to the mens is something I let him do whenever he needs to use the toilet - he normally waits for me outside - today for some reason  he didn t. He panicked   thought the store was closing and that he would be trapped inside and left - before I had gotten out of the toilet with his sister. Unknown to me at the time he had found his way back to the car   as he though that was the safest thing to do. I just wanted to give all the staff that helped me a MASSIVE THANKS ! Two ladies in purple t-shirts who were by the toilets saw me frantically shouting for my son in the mens toilets called for help and instantly a mass off staff came from all over the store - some stood by the front door to make sure he wasn t going to wonder out with a stranger - and loads we re looking all over the store. The two guys that stood with me by the front door kept me together with their jolly personalities and reassurance that my boy would be found - if they hadn t have been so smiley and jolly and totally calm i would have had a nervous breakdown - EVERYONE was amazing - I can t believe how fast they all arrived and how quickly they got themselves organised to look for him ... I don t really want to be publicly stating that I lost my son today   but I noticed there are lots of complaints posted and not many post of positivity and praise . My son was fine and as I said he managed to safety find his way back to the car - if I d have alerted staff sooner   he wouldn t have made it out the door. They clearly have a brilliant missing / lost child policy - I didn t get anyones name as I was in a mass of panic but please do pass my thanks on to the store for finding my spider man (he had his costume on) . Thank you !! Lisa :)					2016-05-07T18:35:57+0000	1462646157	2016-05-07 20:35:57	1126	81	1167	59	1307	80	41	39	109	0	1112	41	0	0	0	0	0

The icing did have a flavour but not a very appetising one so goodness what was in that!

I went to buy a Redmere  Farm cabbage thinking I was buying British and when I looked at the label it was Spanish!  I m sorry but I think this is disgraceful.  It is deception as you think that the Redmere Farm label is British.  I will not be buying anything from this range  and will be looking at shopping elsewhere.					2016-05-07T18:06:43+0000	1462644403	2016-05-07 20:06:43	0	9	0	1	10	8	2	6	15	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A firm favourite in this household were your fresh fish cakes in packs of two it was tough that the salmon ones were usually unavailable but the cod ones were good enough however when I don t my online shopping now there are no cod ones available anymore as it states you no longer sell that product and the salmon ones have reappeared but unfortunately as an inferior product the texture is dry and powdery and they taste like cheap tinned salmon I fact they were so unpalatable that I couldn t actually finish eating them. That s a family meal we used to enjoy swiftly down the pan as I won t buy these again					2016-05-07T14:46:22+0000	1462632382	2016-05-07 16:46:22	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why on earth would tesco use chicken from THAILAND ?? Surly chicken sourced in the UK would seem feasible or do you do it this way as meat is dirt cheap over there ? Having seen images how live chickens are kept in Thailand I can honestly say its much much worse than battery hens.  I ll never buy this product again  infact I ll be looking & reading the backs of packaging from now on to see were meat is sourced from.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13177672_10209639550253442_3140833066382006405_n.jpg?oh=d7353773d76f868446586f18a2456eb8&oe=591B90F6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13177672_10209639550253442_3140833066382006405_n.jpg?oh=cb57c5c35427ef8048734a061155a58c&oe=59173482	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209639550253442&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-07T14:34:23+0000	1462631663	2016-05-07 16:34:23	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I moved into The Cube in Birmingham a few weeks ago. My local shop I like to frequent daily is Tesco Express at The Mailbox. Yesterday I went shopping with my boyfriend to get chicken for his dinner. There were several different varieties of chicken.. However  perplexed  we tried to find the Free Range option. We couldn t find the free range chicken but I earnestly asked an employee to direct us to the Free Range chicken. He responded that the store didn t stock free range chicken. I was totally horrified. I want to be able to exercise my right to purchase cruelty-free chicken. Rather than hundreds of people being forced into buying an item that endorses cruelty and gives an incorrect view of people s moral standing.  It is worth mentioning that this particular Tesco is in a highly affluent area and I am confident many of the residents would want to choose cruelty-free for a higher price. We of course didn t buy the chicken. I would like to be able to buy free range chicken from my local Tesco. I would like you to implement this as soon as possible as I believe it is totally unethical. Please do not underestimate my commitment to this cause and the lengths I will go to to get this rectified and allow my fellow residents the option of choosing cruelty free.					2016-05-07T13:45:48+0000	1462628748	2016-05-07 15:45:48	10	39	10	2	51	39	5	34	47	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went down to the front desk to get a first aider to help clean it up for me as it was dripping with blood. The lady on the desk was very friendly and helpful. The first aider arrived with a manager to check to make sure my son was ok. They ended up phoning an ambulance as it was a head injury and wanted to be on the safe side. I really can t express how great the staff in tesco were and I want to give them some recognition for this. It was the Duloch in Dunfermline store					2016-05-07T13:42:47+0000	1462628567	2016-05-07 15:42:47	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now I know throughout the mummy and daddy community that these baby bays can be the difference between easily getting the little ones - and all the paraphernalia that comes with them! out of the car and into the shops.....or actually going to the shops at all. God knows there is never enough of these spacious bays so I feel a little frustrated when I see - mainly men using them.   Since getting my car keyed I ve been told by numerous people I shouldn t have said anything and in the future to just ignore it but that just doesn t sit well with me.   I m guess I m writing this really to highlight to the non parents how  literally life savings these bays are and to please stop and think before parking in them and to all the parents who see non parents parking there - speak up! If this error in judgement is highlighted to the non parents it may deter them from parking there in the future.    Even though it s going to cost me ¬£100 s to get this scratch fixed  if I saw someone unnecessarily parking in a baby bay would I question them?? the answer is always going to be yes	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13177082_10100385902796728_885866651015127172_n.jpg?oh=ac1c008003de929af7ef9065f683e91d&oe=59181D82	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13177082_10100385902796728_885866651015127172_n.jpg?oh=29ca65d332017944d78f444956dce757&oe=58D7D8FE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100385902796728&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-07T13:15:02+0000	1462626902	2016-05-07 15:15:02	1	10	2	0	12	10	3	7	5	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

I was then told that the order has in fact been cancelled but when I asked if I was to order another trampoline online  is it just going to be cancelled again since you have just told me tesco is having trouble with all its trampoline orders... Nice helpful man told me  I can t see into the future to tell u that!

A few of the guys that work there just stood and watched him struggle but luckily a nice customer helped him put it on the trolley. He then asked another colleague if she can ask someone to help him lift it to his boot and her reply was  no  sorry  and she just walked off watching him struggle.

For instance I wanted to use the disabled toilet or the disabled parking bay.at your local Tesco.Define the word disabled? You can describe a peson as being disabled but the others stated doesn t sound right. The word defective/faulty/ sounds like the more appropriate words to use.					2016-05-07T11:01:28+0000	1462618888	2016-05-07 13:01:28	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He maintained a calm and professional manner in the face of  what can only be described as a rude and obstructive customer who  upon discovering that his shopping was delayed decided he would ensure that no one else would be able to collect theirs. I failed to keep my thoughts on the subject to myself (much to the mortification of my children) but your employee  somehow  managed to keep cool and carry out his work as best he could.

What a mistake! While going to park  a woman walked straight out into the road in front of me without looking so I beeped my horn. Next thing after I park she accosts me and starts giving me abuse while I was getting my daughter out the car. Apparently I should have driven into oncoming traffic according to her and that s what her husband would do apparently! She wouldn t leave me alone and was being really aggressive! I finally shook her off and went in. So we do our shop  and lo and behold she s working in store!! She was on a sample stand at the bottom on the fish counter aisle. I didn t have time to say anything in store but surely this is not acceptable behaviour for any employee!! Really disappointed  think I ll stick to lidl in the future!					2016-05-07T10:39:26+0000	1462617566	2016-05-07 12:39:26	0	9	0	0	9	9	8	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I start a new job on Monday and in preparation for this I acquired myself some smart new threads in your Sunbury store yesterday. Today  this dropped through my door. I could have done with this to help minimise the financial stress that occurs prior to actually being paid for said new employment. Anything we can do?

Tesco own brand nappies used to be our go to nappy  but the last packet of size 4+ have changed. The fastenings have changed meaning they don t fit as well and we have had a lot of leaks. Also  the quality has taken a step down  the absorbant gel has leaked onto her skin a few times in one packet. I bought these nappies in a 3 packets for ¬£10 deal and I am so disappointed I m going to have to try taking the other two packets back to the store as I won t be using them. Why have they changed? Aparently Aldi have good nappies  I m going to give them a go. Regards  Katy					2016-05-07T08:01:26+0000	1462608086	2016-05-07 10:01:26	2	14	2	0	16	14	8	6	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been looking for a long time for a chocolate spread that doesn t use Palm Oil. Unfortunately up until now they all have. Now your extra special chocolate and hazelnut spread doesn t   it s yummy and we love the tiny bits of hazelnut.    Really hope you continue to use rape seed oil instead of palm oil in more of your products; it tastes nicer  supports the British farming community and saves the homes of orangutans.

The fruit used to stay on top but now it sinks into what used to be a nice firm cheesecake mix and is now a cross between custard and cream with what used to be a nice crispy biscuit type base that is now wet mush. They really have changed what used to be a special treat into something that takes ages to digest and makes you feel sick to look at.					2016-05-06T23:55:57+0000	1462578957	2016-05-07 01:55:57	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to thank the lady who works the night shift supervising the self checkout tills in your Cardington Road store in Bedford. I ve been having a dreadful time with my property over the last few weeks. I stopped eating evening meals as I cannot eat or drink in my home as the kitchen is not safe to use and the whole house smells of raw sewerage. I didn t eat evening meals for 4 weeks and lost a stone in weight. I started bulling myself into buying sandwich from Tesco very late at night and eating it in my car as I knew if I took it home with me I would throw it away due to the smell of sewerage always lingering.  On the night of April 18th  I arrived at Tesco and wondered around for half an hour trying to convince myself to eat something. It was 23:45 at night and all I had eaten all day was a mouthful of flapjack. Every time I thought about eating I would wretch as I had the smell of sewerage in my mind even though I wasn t at home to physically smell it. After half an hour of pacing the store up and down  I settled unhappily on a chicken Caesar wrap. I did not want to eat it in my car  in the car park  like a sad loner. So I approached the lady who was supervising the self checkouts and I explained the situation at home briefly and asked if I could possibly eat my sandwich in the corner of the closed cafe. She smiled and said   no problem . She made my day! My week and my month!  Since that evening in the Tesco closed cafe eating a sandwich by myself  I have made sure I have continued to eat every evening. I work much later than I should and eat at the office just before I set off home.  I m meant to finish work at 6pm but I ve often remained at work until after 11pm just to avoid going home. I spent over ¬£100K on a building contractor who was supposed to renovate my home. Instead it feels like he has destroyed it and he s left it in a very bad condition.  Tonight I worked unnecessarily late again to avoid going home. I ve just been into the Cardington Road store and the same lady who worked on the 18th April is there again. I ve just approached her as I was buying a sandwich to ask if her manager was on duty as I wanted to pass to let them know how much her kindness a couple of weeks ago meant to me. She said it wasn t necessary as it was nothing.  It wasn t nothing to me. Monday 18th April was the lowest day in my 43yr life. I m such an upbeat  positive thinking  go-getter  that I never would have imagined I could ever feel that low.  I made a promise to myself that night that I would never  ever eat alone at midnight in a closed Tesco cafe again. Life has to be better than that... surely.  I don t know the name of the lady who helped me on the 18th - the lady who thought what she did for me was nothing. To her it was nothing  to me it was everything and I hope you can pass on my thanks and reward her with praise.  Tonight I m eating my Tesco sandwich in my car but I m not in tears this time  I m feeling quite positive as it goes.  My house is still a bomb site and will be for a good while yet. Thank god you have two 24hr Tesco stores in Bedford.

The page(s) said they were available in store so we rushed down tonight to get them  The 3 items weren t reduced so we checked with a member of the electrical team  (even showing him on the in-store touchscreens that they were cheaper) and the member of staff informed us that as it s cheaper online that they couldn t help. I find this odd as earlier in the year we went into the same store to purchase 2 dvds which were saw were part of a 2 for offer online (The same offer was in store but one of the DVD s we wanted was showing in the offer online and not in store) On this occasion the member of staff did a till adjustment for the item and charged us the expected price.  Could you advise which of the 2 occurrences is correct? Should we have been offered them at the online price?

I know this has been brought to your attention before  so could I implore you to please  please review your selection of rabbit food in your stores. You must be aware by now that sweetcorn kills rabbits. The husks can cause an obstruction in the gut. Unlike cats or dogs  you can t just open up a rabbit s gut to remove an obstruction as the risk of peritonitis is too high. On top of the the aforementioned risk  stasis sets in quickly. Stasis in rabbits results in death within 48 hours.  So why on earth do you still have sweetcorn on your shelves  marketed for rabbits  specifically  when you have been made aware of the risks? If you are unsure  please contact the Rabbit Welfare Association for further information.  I hope you listen to your customers  thanks					2016-05-06T20:04:20+0000	1462565060	2016-05-06 22:04:20	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon being asked to provide proof of age  I happily obliged providing three separate  valid  hologrammed Canadian government pieces of identification. The rude cashier said those were unacceptable and that I am required to show a passport. I asked to speak to her superior  and again was told the same. As I live and work in Dublin  I obviously under no circumstance carry my passport around on a day to day basis.   While I understand this may be an overly cautious company policy to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors  I most certainly do not appreciate being humiliated and angered at till point on a busy Friday evening after work. I m a professional 25 year old woman  who was dressed in office attire trying to purchase a bottle of champagne to celebrate a personal family achievement.   Not only did this ruin my evening after a busy work week  it has also severely dampened the celebratory mood for my husband and I.   Please note that in light of the above events I will permanently cease to frequent Tesco Jervis Street  and will strongly encourage my Dublin City Centre based office to follow suit.   I will note that the young blonde lady supervising was apologetic and polite  however the robust brunette cashier should have further etiquette/customer service training.   I am immensely thankful that there is an M&S just upstairs from your store where I was able to purchase champagne without issue.   I expect a response from a company customer service advisor in a timely manner.   Regards  Tena Doherty					2016-05-06T19:30:37+0000	1462563037	2016-05-06 21:30:37	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I understand your electrics went down on Tuesday night and you lost a fortune in freezer and chilled food not being kept at the correct temperature. With the millions you make every year you would think that the households in the area would be considered. Ever since you opened your store in Dobbins place Crawley the local people have been complaining about the back fences of their homes being destroyed by your delivery vehicles  when we have complained we have been told the lorries aren t Tescos  fair enough  where are the delivering if not to Tesco as there isn t another store for 2 miles and these lorries wouldn t be coming up here. On another point entirely  the delivery times for your store 7 am onwards  why are lorries parked up behind our fences from 5am to deliver to your store  again when we have gone into the store to complain we are aggressively told   we don t have delivers before 7am) your morning staff should be sent on customer service course  if we complain to to you   you send an e mail to the store and is shared around the staff who then make it impossible to shop in your store  I prefer to drive a few miles to get my paper than go into Dobbins place Tesco and believe me I m not the only one. When will this generator be taken away? It s not as if Tesco can t afford to repair the problem with out inconveniencing the neighbourhood.					2016-05-06T18:38:49+0000	1462559929	2016-05-06 20:38:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What a mistake. No healthy options  no fillings for the jacket potatoes. Had to take the first potato back as it was black and free inside. Second wasn t much better. One woman only serving and trying to sort out the serving area etc. She had some tuna made up to go with my potato. Tesco are advertising  field to fork   healthy eating menu cards  and opportunities for schools to come and find out about healthy eating. Your cafe should follow what you advertise. Cakes  crisps  chocolate and fizzy pop on sale. No fruit  grilled food  etc. Kids meal was  sausage roll and chips . Not healthy. The range was poor  and the offering sparse. If you want to fill your cafe then provide tasty  nourishing  healthy food. Please.					2016-05-06T18:09:05+0000	1462558145	2016-05-06 20:09:05	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know this has been brought to your attention before  so could I implore you to please  please review your selection of rabbit food in your stores. You must be aware by now that sweetcorn kills rabbits. The husks can cause an obstruction in the gut. Unlike cats or dogs  you can t just open up a rabbit s gut to remove an obstruction as the risk of peritonitis is too high. On top of the the aforementioned risk  stasis sets in quickly. Stasis in rabbits results in death within 48 hours. A biochemical chain reaction results in multiple organ failure. So why on earth do you still have sweetcorn on your shelves  marketed for rabbits  specifically  when you have been made aware of the risks?

To which one colleague told me they would look into further compensation if they felt deemed. You read my messages responded on the page to cover yourself.

Ordered for 10-11pm last night  was told it was delayed and would arrive between 10-11:51pm  which I understand delays do happen. I waited and waited and no one showed up or even informed me that they wasn t coming. I work nights and sometime difficult to get shopping in and was relying on this order to get my through my weekend shifts.  I have now re scheduled my Order but that s not the point  as I have to go without until it arrives. If it ever does. I have never had a problem with my delivery before and this has actually made me think twice about using Tesco s again. The common curtesy would have been to inform me they wasn t coming and re arrange my delivery as I had to call in myself to find out what had happened.					2016-05-06T14:26:03+0000	1462544763	2016-05-06 16:26:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I realise in this day and age  and with the new right on crusade of gender fluidity  you may be trying to corner a sub-section of the market: however in all my years I have never managed to self identify as female.  If anything I m currently fighting the urge to self identify as marmoset.					2016-05-06T14:17:14+0000	1462544234	2016-05-06 16:17:14	0	1	0	1	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called your office on the 4th of May after 3 pm because the delivery person was late and I found out (via my online banking ) your office overcharged me for the soap I bought  without informing me  charging me ¬£ 2.50 each for the soap I bought   instead of ¬£1.25 sale price I bought it for and was send to me via Tesco order confirmation.  I was on the phone with your staff who was trying to contact the shop that charged me that full amount without informing me   which she did without success   and she could not call the delivery person because she did not have a phone number of the delivery person and the delivery person did not leave a message to explain why he was very late.  I was informed   by your staff  to still go out  because your delivery person was late  it was around 3.30pm and she could not contact the store and I had to go out. I am very disappointed that your office still did not refund me the ¬£1 service charge   despite charging me full price  for what was on sale and the delivery man not delivering my order at the allocated time  2pm -3pm.   Kindly refund me the ¬£1 service charge.  Kind regards  Ngozi Okwara					2016-05-06T11:57:36+0000	1462535856	2016-05-06 13:57:36	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But I do find it somewhat annoying that you use so much packaging for such a small item (see below).  Not only do I have to use what precious space I have in our recycling box but I m sure you will agree that the box and all the packaging is totally ridiculous for the item?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-0/s130x130/13177803_10153524067945686_2244465610510088306_n.jpg?oh=ff764e085bc725d3523a246ee1cf28dc&oe=58D8DDF0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-9/s720x720/13177803_10153524067945686_2244465610510088306_n.jpg?oh=e2989a86a80898704fc42afbebb77c72&oe=592484FD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153524067945686&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-06T11:43:35+0000	1462535015	2016-05-06 13:43:35	4	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	2	0	4	0	0	1	0	0	0

I have weighed them and they seem to only be 240 grams each  Does this count as jumbo size..... next to it is one that I would say is a real jumbo!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13124664_10153448088972102_3456960813399522947_n.jpg?oh=bace9534b8c61382936c0c9e812e0f2f&oe=590DA158	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13124664_10153448088972102_3456960813399522947_n.jpg?oh=3225fa5f1a9a109ea7e4ff0e45a621c7&oe=5906B755	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153448088972102&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-06T07:10:48+0000	1462518648	2016-05-06 09:10:48	3	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last night was the first time Tesco ever had the quiet hours for people with Autism and other sensory needs. So I went up to see if it made a difference.It was so much nicer to shop in.I seen some people that I know who have kids with special needs and we smiled at each other and went on our way. On the escalator going down I heard the woman behind me say to her son was it nicer shopping when it was like this.Im not shy so I asked her how it was going and she said it was great. She wouldn t normally bring her young lad shopping . Now that made my day . It made me feel happy that this young lad could go and pick out his Spider-Man outfit without becoming distressed .For his mam to be able to hold his hand and talk about what you was good or what shoes where nice. Shopping for anyone can be a nightmear for kids with special needs it can be really difficult and for their parents and careers it can be a lonely traumatic Expriance.Last night it wasn t. So saying Thank you To all the Tesco staff   Lisa Mcevoy and Damien the MD doesn t really explain how I feel.The words included and valued and matters and belonging all spin to mind. Lisa had the feedback sheets at the customer service desk in Balbriggan .Please please fill them in. Thanks everyone. Hopefully this can happen every week .					2016-05-06T06:46:54+0000	1462517214	2016-05-06 08:46:54	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I d like to say thank you to Ashley of your  extra  store in Salford. At least I think that was his name (young chap with a shaved head  working on customer service this evening). I went in looking to buy a pen used to detect fake banknotes as I was selling my car for cash and didn t want to take any chances and get lumbered with any fake notes. Ashley told me that the store didn t stock these items but once I explained my situation he very kindly offered to lend me one of the store s own pens used at tills so that I could check the money whilst selling my car.  A small gesture I know lending me a pen  but he didn t have to do that and by doing it he helped me out with something non-tesco related which was much appreciated. Needless to say I have returned the pen following the sale of the car! Using it put my mind at ease. He even explained to me what would happen should I come across any fake notes.   Great customer service üëçüèª					2016-05-05T22:19:49+0000	1462486789	2016-05-06 00:19:49	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I think you must employ someone to entertain us online shoppers. Gone are the days of me moaning that I haven t got any carrier bags (and unlikely to happen again since I now have to pay  lol!)  and we re now surrounded by your hilariously funny substitutes.

When I sign in to do an online shop I have to put in my password twice. The password is already stored in my computer but it doesn t recognise it and I have to delete the password and type it in again before I sign in. Very strange. I should get somebody in to have a look at it if I were you. Just saying.					2016-05-05T18:41:58+0000	1462473718	2016-05-05 20:41:58	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought two ¬£25 visa gift cards at Southampton branch for Mothers Day gifts for my mum and mother-in-law. The cashier scanned the cards and charged me for them but when my mum and mother-in-law tried to redeem them they discovered they had not activated  even though I had paid for them. I no longer had my receipt as I was unaware they were not activated and thought they already been spent my mum. I decided to go back to Tesco to have a look at the gift cards and found out there is a strip on the back of the card that has to be removed and scanned to activate. I picked up two more to replace the previous ones and when I went through the checkout the cashier did the same thing again! They scanned the small barcode at the top of the packet  I told them the packet says to remove the panel and use that barcode to activate it. The cashier and supervisor were unaware that if the panel was not removed and the small barcode was scanned then the customer is charged for a card that is not activated!! Very annoyed that I ve now spent ¬£105.90 to get two ¬£25 gift cards. ( 2 x ¬£25 for two unactivated cards and 2 x ¬£27.95 for two activated cards (yes you get charged ¬£2.95 for activating each card!!)) Tesco needs to train their cashiers how to process gift cards properly.					2016-05-05T18:32:09+0000	1462473129	2016-05-05 20:32:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After various investigations and mounting costs from a few garages a test was carried out on the fuel itself and finally a diagnosis of the fuel is what caused my car to stop running perfectly. I have had the tank drained and the car is now back on the road. However I contacted Tesco today and they are denying that there was any issues with their fuel in South Wigston on the 3rd of April 2016!!!! Interestingly I went to see the duty Manager last night (Milissa) who confirmed they had indeed had several cases of fuel contamination and apologised etc explaining that they did try to contact as many vehicles as possble through number plate recognition but could only reach so many (me not being one of them). I told her that they should have done more to try and solve the problem by putting large notices on the petrol station forecourt and in store saying they had a problem so that customers could come forward! Anyway I also went to speak to Tony in the petrol station counter point and he said he was sorry  that he recalls serving me that day and me going back to ask him if there was an issue with the fuel and he said I was the first customer that came back that day so at that point he did not know there was an issue but that many cars after me came back to and were all referred to Head Office. The famous Head Office have responded by saying they have had no reports at all from South Wigston petrol station! I am appealing for anyone who has any information to message me please - anything at all ... do you know of any fuel contamination at Tesco recently. do you know anyone this has happened to and do you know if Tesco have admitted it? Please help - thank you. I intend to take this to the Small Claims Court so need all the help I can get as my costs incurred to date are over ¬£2000 so I cannot let it go. Thanks  Ana.					2016-05-05T18:14:37+0000	1462472077	2016-05-05 20:14:37	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Most on shelves is no added sugar fair enough but again stops me buying due to the use of aspartame which doesnt agree with me or anyone else in the family.

What I actually did after school was pick up my equally hot and bothered children  who outdid themselves by throwing some  stroppy  an irrational  into the mix and drove them to Tesco Express  Silva Island Way  Wickford to use the photo booth so that we may apply for their passports.   At this stage  I need to stress that the booth is INSIDE Tesco. So I queue up  and cheerily asked the cashier if she could change the two ¬£10 notes so that I may use the photo booth (it is still INSIDE Tesco) and was told that they were not allowed to give change for the photo booth (the booth that is INSIDE Tesco). My shoulders drop  dismayed at this I wearily ask what the cheapest thing is that I can buy and proceed to purchase a pack of unwanted gum just for an easy solution. The cashier processes the transaction and hands me my change.....which consist of 8 ¬£2 coins and some small change. Now  I already know that the booth takes either a ¬£5.00 note or a combination of two ¬£2 coins and a ¬£1 coin (using the exact money only)  however the change that the (now smirking) cashier hands me (as she slams the till drawer closed) does not contain any combination of the correct coins or notes. She simply grins and says  Well  you asked for change .  So we repeat the entire exercise with another ¬£10 note and I am now 2 unwanted packets of chewing gum better off with the urge to jump over the counter and shove both packets into the cashiers smug face. Needless to say  I didn t  although she was left in no doubt about my feelings towards her actions.   I am now at home drinking wine  I have avoided the junk food so far  I am fairly certain that Channing Tatum is not coming  but I have my pictures  my health and I was not arrested for assault today....all in all  today was a good day.					2016-05-05T17:19:26+0000	1462468766	2016-05-05 19:19:26	4	2	4	0	6	2	2	0	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I took a tv/dvd combi in to the store that is faulty and will no longer play dvds. After explaining the situation to a staff member at the customer service desk I was immediately put onto a telephone with barley an explanation   with no acknowledgment of my issue  in fact your member of staff hardly made eye contact with me let alone showed any empathy or sympathy.   The member of staff I then spoke to on the phone proceeded to take 10 minutes asking endless  and mostly irrelevant  questions only to tell me that I would have to contact Toshiba (the manufactor) myself.  After explaining that this was not helpful to me as my contract is with Tesco as the retailer who sold me the item   which was under 12 months old  I requested to speak to a manager in the store from your member of staff I had originally spoken to.   Again  with no explanation she walked to the telephone at the other side of the counter  turned her back to me and spoke in a low voice into the phone  obviously explaining to your manager her version of what had happened.   Your customer service manager came across a few minutes later.  Again I received no sympathy or empathy to my situation  she barely acknowledged it and had clearly pre empted what she was going to say after her discussion on the phone.   I found her rude and unsympathetic to my issue and began a conversation with regards something that had happened to her which was irrelevant  with no apology for my situation or seeming to care. She flatly refused to help remedy the reason that I was in your store and even implied that I should be grateful that I had had 11 months use of the tv.   I left feeling totally humiliated that this was conducted in front of other customers and members of staff who were watching and listening and I do not feel as though I received any kind of customer service at all. Not what I would expect from a large company as yours with such a good reputation.   I told your manager that I would take the matter further which was received with a smirk  and I left feeling totally under valued as a loyal customer of yours.   I will not be shopping at your company any more   and I am totally frustrated at the attitude I received from your staff. Not one of them took ownership  all three of them passed me on with no consideration whatsoever.   I appreciate that you may have policies (although I am certain many other large companies would have refunded me with no question for a tv/dvd worth around ¬£100)  but I was made to feel through your staff s questioning that it was somehow my fault and my problem that it had broken after such a short time.					2016-05-05T14:02:22+0000	1462456942	2016-05-05 16:02:22	0	24	1	0	25	24	7	17	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

On a number of occasions i have seen people using parent and child spaces with either no children or teenagers using these spaces even though the sign clearly says for young children. Today i decided to take a photo of one of these inconsiderate people s car. This vehicle was driven by a woman and out of the car came one other person. A teenage boy. No child that needs help to be secured in and out of a carseat  no child that needed to be transfered from carseat to trolley/stroller  no infant carrier needed to be taken out of the vehicle. All of which may have warrented the extra space that these parent and child spaces offer. On many occasions i have expressed to staff what happens and nobody has been interested. Out of the people i know who use parent and child spaces when they have young children with them  including myself  everyone has said they would prefer these spaces to be on the opposite side of the carpark so lazy people don t use them when there are spaces a few metres away. We don t expect to be right next to the store we just like that there is a little extra room so that we don t accidentally damage another vehicle when bending like pretzels into our cars to get young children out. If i had parked in a disabled bay without a badge these charges would have been inforced but i doubt parking in a parent and young child space without a young child would be given a charge. If nothing is done about this then the notice on the wall is as redundant as the ability to park right in the woman who parked there.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t34.0-0/p130x130/13153347_2011780482381056_150251575_n.jpg?oh=af3a56f37a9990569e1cc295276bef1c&oe=58811B16	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t34.0-12/p720x720/13153347_2011780482381056_150251575_n.jpg?oh=6adcc6304b007e659aa9c1319bbf51cb&oe=588011A6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2011859445706493&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-05T13:58:14+0000	1462456694	2016-05-05 15:58:14	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Its a very very small roll. At 75p I was expecting something a bit more substantial.

I was told by a lady at a different shop that they sell it in tesco. Also 2 for 4 pound. I couldn t find it so asked a member of staff who showed me but the shelf was empty. She then told me to go to customer services for them to call another member of staff to check if there was any out the back. . I can t thank the gentlemen enough Who was on customer services. Who sorted it out for me. Also the man who went out the back and got it for me.I had my 2 year old with me and I bought 2 bags of sand which was pretty heavy to pick up with one hand and hold my little boys hand. So then the gentlemen on customer services carried the sand to my car for me. Which he didn t have to do. Thank you very much. üòÉ					2016-05-05T12:58:30+0000	1462453110	2016-05-05 14:58:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It makes me wonder firstly why the store has an extensive range of frozen vegatarian sausages in various styles but have discontinued the only falafel option and secondly   why the shop is filling the shelves  witth more expencive ranges.

Unfortunately it s impossible to stop him growing (starvation is frowned upon) so he has grown out of the size 2 nappies quicker than anticipated. Now I ve returned stuff to asda and morrisons without a receipt and not had any problems in exchanging items so thought tesco would be the same... Rang the store today to be spoken to like crap by some snotty customer service  adviser  who advised me I can t even return to exchange for size 3 nappies despite them being unopened and the offer still being exactly the same... So now (whereas all my babies clothes did come from tesco) when he pees through to his clothes cos his nappies are too small  I ll be damn sure to go to morrisons or asda for new clothes (and bigger nappies) as at least I know I can exchange there if required... Thanks tesco  every little help or very little help?					2016-05-05T07:37:59+0000	1462433879	2016-05-05 09:37:59	4	9	4	0	13	9	4	5	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

They are not as nearly as good as they were when I last bought them.  The changes include: Less absorbent and more leaks. More bulky Hard plastic around the elastic gathering around the legs Bits of  gel  seep through the nappy and onto our daughters skin  For the first time in a year we are getting leaking nappies and nappy rash.  Tesco you have made a really bad decision changing your nappies and have lost my trust in them.					2016-05-05T05:31:20+0000	1462426280	2016-05-05 07:31:20	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Everything i placed in the trolley was thrown out and the noise coming from him was horrendous üò©üòÇ of course I shouldn t be embarrassed as he doesn t understand I couldn t help becoming Rosey cheeked! That s when my 4 year old daughter started the  I want to go home  chants! By this time I was flustered and tired trying to keep cool and smile whist picking a blue eyeliner with my nan! Then one of your lovely staff came to the rescue offering my  Angels  some free fruit to keep them happy and occupied! We could then get on with the rest of the shopping in peace!

I really can t believe in this day and age and with consumer protection  Your company is treating me this way        The Mobile Phone I brought was faulty from the day I brought it. I took it back when I realised that it was. well within the 14 days   I should have had it replace.. But I was fobbed off by the sales assistant that they had fixed the problem   clear they had not..  I took the phone back again within the time limit...again I still fobbed off by the sales assistant.     I have taken the Mobile phone back four times now... Still with the original problems from day one...For a company like Tescos this is a disgrace... And no wonder we need Customer Protection Laws..     My address.      My Mobile Number is   One of Several E mails I have sent to Tesco s over a Mobile Phone I brought from them which was faulty on the day I brought it...Not been answered yet....just being past around..

Not happy at all tesco  I may have to shop elsewhere.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13179179_10208196863352152_6026419301310139047_n.jpg?oh=5d5bf1fbcd184fd17daa77c38a820f93&oe=59170A4B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13179179_10208196863352152_6026419301310139047_n.jpg?oh=1eeaa53e75e258b474472d663dcb894d&oe=58DB7F46	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208196863352152&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-04T13:00:28+0000	1462366828	2016-05-04 15:00:28	1	5	1	0	6	5	4	1	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Staff who have worked for the company since before 1999 will have their Sunday premiums cut from double time to time and a half. Some night Workers who are contracted to Saturday and Sunday nights are set to lose thousands of pounds a year. Cutting of night premium 1 will impact on all twilight workers who currently work between 10pm and midnight costing them between ¬£1.50-¬£3 a day. It will also mean a reduction of 79p a night for all night workers. Giving a 3.1% pay rise to some staff  1.6% to night workers and a pay cut to other members of staff is not  fair . Tesco openly admit the cuts to long standing colleagues pay is helping to fund an across the board  pay rise . But for many staff it s a pay cut. The reduction/cutting of location pay is also going to impact many staff  some who work in areas where the cost of living is already extremely high. Offering a one off  transition  payment of 18 months worth of the difference is not good enough. People have made financial commitments based on their take home wages  now they are having them cut they will find themselves in serious financial difficulty. Tesco should not be allowed to take money out of people s every day wages to fund a pay rise for  some  colleagues. If they have to reduce wages then it should be done over a longer period of time  giving colleagues 5 months notice that they will be thousands of pounds a year worse off is quite frankly disgraceful.					2016-05-04T12:07:49+0000	1462363669	2016-05-04 14:07:49	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These are sent out  to me  as a result of a specific delivery  and show how much better Tesco prices were compared with the others.  But this is already printed on my delivery sheet  and  just adds to my inbox!  I appreciate it could be a very small overhead to your computer  but if I could just tick a  do not send if I ve saved money  would be very useful.    I m certain your bright computer people can design a clever email selection system that helps cut down on stuff that we get.  Obviously  there d need to be a tick box that says  send if we were dearer  and here s a money-off coupon to make up for it .

Remember the saying If You Don t Ask You Don t Get? It may be possible that if you did your request will hopefully be successful. The coconut macaroons that had been withdrawn were back on the shelves and ready to buy after my enquiry but now have been off the shelves again for quite a few weeks. Another item that was withdrawn a long time ago was the value shower gel. I remember buying it for 11p before it was withdrawn. Whether or not this will be in stock again remains to be seen.					2016-05-03T22:03:34+0000	1462313014	2016-05-04 00:03:34	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am 8 months pregnant and was doing the first shop for our new home  so the trolley was brimming! Firstly  when at the till I had no room left for a BBQ I wanted to buy so a gentleman went and found the item and brought it to the till.   He then offered to get another trolley straight away  waited till I had purchased everything then arranged for another colleague to take my second trolley out to my car. They then lifted all my bags and filled the car for me.   It was difficult to manage myself and I was really grateful for the help  which I didn t even have to ask for. People don t always recognise great service so please can this be passed on? Unfortunately I didn t catch their names.   Thanks!					2016-05-03T20:16:01+0000	1462306561	2016-05-03 22:16:01	6	5	6	0	11	5	2	3	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Are your customer service team aware of the terms of the new  Consumer Rights Act 2015 ? In particular  those relating to considered contracts and delivery? Also in particular in relation to washing machines?  An answer. I guess not  judging by the correspondence I have received this evening. Interesting.......please respond					2016-05-03T20:14:50+0000	1462306490	2016-05-03 22:14:50	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately you didn t quite manage this and I had to contact you 5 days later again before this was done.   Onwards and upwards I thought.....  Well this evening you delivered my weekly shop  and here I am again! Amongst this weeks highlights  2 bath sponges which I requested  2 different colours please but  NOT PINK . I received 2 identical pink sponges. My 2 boys will find any excuse not to wash so this will go down a storm.   You also apparently anticipated that having received my shopping at 8.30pm I would immediately leap to my cooker and whip up a quick stir fry - because the stir fry vegetables you delivered have to be used by today. Yet again there was no indication of this on my paperwork  or mention from the driver  so it was not until I unpacked my shopping that I realised the challenged me to the great British fry off.   To top it off I also had 2 substitutions and one unavailable item (apparently there was no alternative to a multipack of Pepsi anywhere in your store?!).   You may have gathered that I haven t had the best day today. I may even concede I m a bit grumpy.but I don t have time to complain every single week when you deliver me short dated or out of date products. Maybe I have set my standards too high but I consider that the most basic expectation if my shopping is delivered - that i will have the opportunity to cook it and not just condemn it to the bin.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13138748_10153373489235728_7102632151641506697_n.jpg?oh=7e4ee86742ce288e3b66bec86ed3f5ca&oe=58D9AF3F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13138748_10153373489235728_7102632151641506697_n.jpg?oh=3789a719ce19ddccdfd0d3750d7f453b&oe=591BE732	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153373489235728&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-03T20:05:30+0000	1462305930	2016-05-03 22:05:30	21	8	22	0	30	7	4	3	0	0	21	0	0	0	0	1	0

Lovely delivery driver pointed me in the right direction on what to do next; very helpful customer service lady over the phone (think her name was Moira) rang the store and then when she couldn t get through  later phoned me back; manager from the Southport dot com team then called and said a driver would bring me another pack (bringing my nappy total above what I had originally ordered) a couple of hours later. Another lovely driver then arrived on time  full of apologies AND with a card and a present for my new baby. Couldn t be happier with the exceptional customer service recovery which was not expected but definitely appreciated.

I was extremely happy to discover there would be a caterpillar cake on sale  however each slice/portion is 50% of your daily sugar which is double that of the ordinary caterpillar cake - this is unreasonably high and unnecessary.   I was also disappointed to find that it is nothing like the normal caterpillar cake. It is not a Swiss roll and instead of a chocolate coating has a very thick layer of icing (just changing this would dramatically reduce the sugar content I feel)  I also feel that as this cake is aimed at children who have to put up with little choice when it comes to cake  sugar content should be far lower.					2016-05-03T17:44:54+0000	1462297494	2016-05-03 19:44:54	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My mother ordered a PS4 online yesterday for her grandchildren which is advertised as coming with a free second controller. This was not delivered with the console so I phoned up customer services to enquire its whereabouts. I was told it was out of stock so the offer does not stand. 1. On my order form it stated the offer was standing. 2. It STILL says online the offer stands and does not mention the stock. I have asked for the controller to be delivered once it is becomes available but was told it is not part of their policy. My mother has spent ¬£319.99 under false pretenses; she chose to buy from Tesco because of this very offer.					2016-05-03T15:19:38+0000	1462288778	2016-05-03 17:19:38	0	6	0	1	7	5	2	3	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However I am so disappointed with what arrived! Firstly it was the wrong ones  I ordered the pink butterfly happy birthday cupcakes and these were blue with balloons on and secondly the mess they arrived in was terrible in the box. They were for a 30th birthday party on Friday. Please say you can fix this shambles and send me the pink butterfly happy birthday cupcakes I ordered by Friday??? Thanks  Vicky.					2016-05-03T11:54:03+0000	1462276443	2016-05-03 13:54:03	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I attended the Express Store at Cowbridge Road in Canton on the 24th April 2016 in the morning and purchased 2 Vanilla Crowns answer an Almond Croissant.  To cut a long story short  one of the Crowns contained a blue plaster which had clearly been baked into the same. I returned the item to the  Team Leader  who took my details and assured me that the matter would be investigated.  ( An Asian/Pakistani chap called Saleem or something similar)  This matter causes me serious concerns as to the consequences had I consumed the above mentioned product.  I am a cancer patient and currently undergo chemotherapy and any infection or illness contracted as a result of consumption of the aforementioned catering plaster.  I want this matter investigated. I authorise you to search your database for my customer details and my Club card info. This confirm when the item was purchased. You have 14 days to investigate this item. I will pass my complaint to the FSA thereafter.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13151537_10153635797262709_8751927253512520103_n.jpg?oh=b4feccd089d4c7c796535eaadaf065cd&oe=591877CF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13151537_10153635797262709_8751927253512520103_n.jpg?oh=b5386a4a40cbac9162094c991aaf7307&oe=5906F2C2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153635797262709&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-03T10:15:58+0000	1462270558	2016-05-03 12:15:58	2	21	3	0	24	20	4	16	15	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0

Every time I go there is problems! they never have anything in stock and to be spoke to off a dispenser the way I was is a joke! Wouldn t mind but I was buying nit lotion for my daughter and she refusing to give it me because i hadn t checked my hair? she actually told me to go boots or sainsburys!! The doctor has prescribed my daughter a lotion that they didn t have in stock so why she felt she could re fuse me one at first is beyond me. Eventually someone who is actually qualified in medicine served me while I bought the lotion. How ridiculous!! Every time I come here they are so rude and think they know best. All over a bit of nit lotion! ! I Didn t know you needed a degree to sell it. I wouldn t mind either but it cost me near enough ¬£20 for the lotion...  So for all future customers   go boots or Sainsburys ...					2016-05-03T08:33:45+0000	1462264425	2016-05-03 10:33:45	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I m a 33year old woman who wasn t allowed to buy alcohol in one of your tesco express shops on Friday past  as I had no ID with me  I was told by the till operator it was policy to ask yet the gentleman at the next till wasn t asked. I find it a bit odd that myself and my friend were singled out as we clearly look over the age of 18. My friend who happened to have her driving licence with her also was not allowed to get served because I had none and I was with her. I then had to get my dad out of his car to come in and purchase the alcohol for me for a family celebration that had been organised. I would understand it if I looked under age but I m a grown woman that apparently looked under 18 to this lady. I look forward to your response as I m still a bit miffed by it all.

Can you see the problem with the attached pictures?   The bottom polo shirt is an M&S 8-9 year old  the top one  an F&F 9-10 year old. The sizing of your clothing is truly disappointing and as we wouldn t think there would be so much difference in size we cannot now return for an exchange or refund as we have washed them  and before anyone says they have shrunk  they were rinsed through on a cold wash.  We have further photos with the size labels if required.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13095782_1199575263388303_3441133365347154536_n.jpg?oh=577452d97b317bf4bf0eabd0bcb35b3e&oe=591A6CF1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13095782_1199575263388303_3441133365347154536_n.jpg?oh=8168f0550ea6b1a9cc221bd34f7bbc1f&oe=5913408D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1199575263388303&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-02T18:46:31+0000	1462214791	2016-05-02 20:46:31	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner had the chicken tikka and I was discusted to discover that not only did it not come with some form of side (rice) but also was literally five pieces of diced chicken chicken In a sauce which I payed ¬£1.50 for! I then tried the hunters chicken  which was nothing like my usual. It was so greasy  my wedges ended up soggy and the hunters chicken had no bacon!!

I arrived at your widnes store today to print out my sisters wedding pictures as their gift from myself. I got to the photo centre at 4.40pm to find that there was a glorious red ribbon blocking my path! I went to the customer service and asked the lady who said it should be open until 6pm but the woman who is trained in operating a till and printer might be on her break. I was stood waiting until 5 past 5 when finally a member of staff said they will go to the canteen and find her. 3 members of staff and 15 minutes later we come to the conclusion that she has closed up early for the day and has gone to enjoy the British summer. I now have a late wedding present that is even later and sore legs from standing around (luckily there was some empty shelving to lean on and a kids piano which I played a beautiful rendition of Titanic on to pass some time) back to the point maybe some clearer signage for your opening hours and more trained staff on that department. Luckily the Asda round the corner has a photo centre that s open until 8pm tonight.

I also use several of their other services. I do regularly shop online with them and have a delivery saver account set up. With all this information about me available I wonder why I get sent a series of vouchers that are only useful if I shop in store which I rarely do. We questioned this with your customer services only to be told it s a marketing issue. Surely the point of marketing is to try and offer what the customers wants not what they patently don t use!					2016-05-02T12:14:05+0000	1462191245	2016-05-02 14:14:05	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just fuelled up using your store up in Inverness retail park at 106.9 to then discover I could have gotten it cheaper at another tesco store literally about 2 miles away at 105.9? So can you please explain why the Same company charges different fuel prices or do you just like trying to rip off your customers? This happened on 01/05/2016 at approx 7pm your cctv systems in place at the retail store can verify this.

Get to checkout and lo and behold the free control is out if stock. Will there be more in before the offer runs out? Nope.....but if you want to buy a controller on their own you can.

I have a flat tyre... I went in to the shop as I have no cash and thought if I bought a sandwich and a drink I would be able to buy 20p for the air machine. I was told I could not have any cash back not even 20p to fix my flat tyre. No humanity! I am no longer a customer!

Yesterday  I wasn t feeling too great so we decided to go to the cafe in the Kilmarnock branch. I needed a sit down and a drink  I was feeling very lightheaded. I ordered a drink and picked up prepackaged pancakes. My partner and kids all had a drink and a cake too. I opened my pancakes and put butter on the first one  took a bite and it was raw on the inside. My partner took them up to the counter to ask if I could swap or get my money back and the lady at the till said that s how they re meant to be and they come to the store that way. So  I m guessing that means I have to take them home and finish cooking them myself?  Anyway  we were refused our money back and I never got any kind of offer of a replacement. If I had been feeling better I might have went to the customer service desk but instead I just went home.					2016-05-01T16:09:46+0000	1462118986	2016-05-01 18:09:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As newly diagnosed im pretty much having to stick to expensive free from items   Anyway went to your Fareham store  was helped by a very friendly member of staff who took time to take me to the free from section and walk me thro what was there and a couple items she knows are nice.  The store was clean and well stocked...  Today i get my bagels out to eat them and see the best before date is TODA im the only Ceoliac in the house and i cant eat all 4 in one day  and freezing is an option but shouldnt be my only option.  At ¬£2.30 for 4 bagels i didnt expect such a short shelf life ...... maybe a reduced free from section would be helpful (no maybe about it) and more checks on dates of items.  Ive added a pic of what i think you need.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13103391_10156894411500525_3589278995183687610_n.jpg?oh=41ec0eeeb0743dabec8b69a634a4d90d&oe=590AEC0A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13103391_10156894411500525_3589278995183687610_n.jpg?oh=4758a1ba4382fcec6adf838f8fb636bd&oe=591F2B07	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156894411500525&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-01T15:27:46+0000	1462116466	2016-05-01 17:27:46	2	10	2	0	12	10	1	9	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have not been disappointed. i always get what i need  the shop has always been stocked and the staff have always been polite ( sainsburys you could learn a lot from them!) parking is soooo much easier too! Today i had my first tesco online delivery. I booked a 4 hour slot from 8am - noon. i got a text about half way through to say they may be late  up to 1 21pm. short while later i got another text to tell me they would be there by noon and it was. The driver (Martin) was very polite  realised i hadn t had a delivery from them before so explained everything  brought the shopping into the house for me too.

Unfortunately I ate it before I saw the date on the front. Ironically I bought it instead of a chocolate bar as it seems more healthy. Shocking that they are selling things without keeping track of seek by dates.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13083153_10100555180231531_1145549917219066710_n.jpg?oh=acf34ddef6cf6783d4d64ae730396783&oe=5910F908	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13083153_10100555180231531_1145549917219066710_n.jpg?oh=c71b8b098851dc12ff4b8f36792fa9d1&oe=5907B105	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100555180231531&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-01T13:16:13+0000	1462108573	2016-05-01 15:16:13	1	6	1	0	7	6	3	3	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every now and again  go out and wipe the nozzles and fill up the tissues. I did not appreciate getting diesel all over my hands today! And perhaps have a packet of baby wipes at the till for customers who would like to get it off their hands!  Other than that  can t fault the staff üòä					2016-05-01T13:12:18+0000	1462108338	2016-05-01 15:12:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well your not willing to help me with my order that I placed with Tesco Direct on Thursday and was meant to be delivered on Saturday. It is now looking like that the order will not be delivered til Tuesday. I phoned Tesco Direct for help to ask if I could pick up the goods that I ordered from my local store but was told no this was not an option. My son is very upset that the order hasn t arrived and I thought you would be able to help out but no that doesn t look like the case. I am very disappointed with Tesco as I have been a loyal customer for years.					2016-05-01T12:52:03+0000	1462107123	2016-05-01 14:52:03	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got them out this morning to use and half of them are bruised  have sprouted mouldy patches overnight and are mushy and nasty-looking. I don t know if this has been a storage or transportation issue but they have a best before of 4th May but I m throwing these on the compost on the 1st! Not the first time I ve noticed your fruit & veg is decidedly less-than-fresh looking! Normally I weed out many looking veg in the store before I buy but on this occasion  I missed it  thinking I could trust the BB date.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13124475_10204848098881367_5563980892656732639_n.jpg?oh=3c208f3ebb5698a66027a423f2ec8804&oe=590DDAC0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13124475_10204848098881367_5563980892656732639_n.jpg?oh=36e9ce99bc88a42349e1b2ee024942f9&oe=5915EB26	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204848098881367&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-01T12:14:11+0000	1462104851	2016-05-01 14:14:11	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He certainly knows a way to a girl s heart! ‚ù§	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13100903_10156820273505133_3943748945649035639_n.jpg?oh=4205e70669da5fbdc1240a59784fcd68&oe=58DBCB9B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13100903_10156820273505133_3943748945649035639_n.jpg?oh=67f6e8361f070a6b12962bb2fd3d2277&oe=59122196	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156820273505133&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-05-01T10:02:24+0000	1462096944	2016-05-01 12:02:24	9	1	9	0	10	1	1	0	1	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

There is major congestion problem in store with staff and their  Tesco Tractors .  You have staff parking these Tesco Tractors three deep and blocking access to produce all over the store.  You may be getting business from customers too lazy to shop for themselves but its extremely aggravating when staff have absolutely no consideration for in store shoppers.					2016-05-01T09:53:09+0000	1462096389	2016-05-01 11:53:09	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You stopped stocking Robertsons lemon marmalade  you then stopped stocking Tesco own brand lemon marmalade.  As a result I have to go to Morrisons to get some lemon marmalade and therefore you lost ¬£40 of turnover as I bought my daily shop there. As an accountant it seems to me that is a rather poor loss making decision on your part.  There are nearly 2 metres of orange marmalade on display including 1 metre of shelving devoted to Tesco cheepie orange marmalade which it seems very few buy as the shelf is always full.  Thus for two rows of lemon marmalade you will lose a customers shop once in every four weeks. Thats really good management!					2016-05-01T09:48:57+0000	1462096137	2016-05-01 11:48:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Except when I read the exclusions everything except food is excluded. Now ¬£10 off a ¬£100 spend is very generous but I shop 3-4 times a week for fresh produce and although I spend more than ¬£100 in total its never together. Hence I will never use my vouchers.  So a bit of a shot in the foot methinks!					2016-05-01T09:44:03+0000	1462095843	2016-05-01 11:44:03	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The new nappies give my daughter severe nappy rash  they leave crystals all over her bum.  They also no longer fit properly. They hang off her bum but are tight aroind the legs  the tags also come off. I ve used tesco nappies for both of my children but will no longer be using them.					2016-05-01T06:22:35+0000	1462083755	2016-05-01 08:22:35	2	9	2	0	11	9	8	1	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0
