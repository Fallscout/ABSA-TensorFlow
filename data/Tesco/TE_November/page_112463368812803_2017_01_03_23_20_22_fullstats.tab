I ll post here because apparently my emailed complaint might take 3 days to respond to.  Order 246776485 - your systems are currently showing it as delivered this evening  but it wasn t.  Imagine you have a £50 incentive reward card  in the format of a Mastercard. Imagine you also have a delivery saver refund of £15.  Now imagine  that having put the code through  at checkout it tells you the exact amount to pay is £50.  Then  the next day  the store tries to put through a payment of over £70  because that s how the system works . Really? You check cards for a higher payment than that to be charged?   Yes we check the card before any vouchers or delivery saver comes off  said the clueless woman on the phone.  Erm  overstepping the mark part 1 there. I authorised £50 at checkout  not £71.   That s what would happen if you shopped in store  said the clueless woman on the phone.  now let s see... you would scan my shopping  then scan any vouchers... nope you don t know if I am paying by card or cash at this point but would tell me the amount. So no  it isn t what would happen in store.  I then get home from work after telling you to stick the order up your backside to be told by the teenage children that you also called my home number & asked one of them to make an alternative payment.  I m sure he d pay you it back  was what was said.  Overstepping the mark part 2 there Tesco  discussing my account with other people.  I look forward to my voucher being given back to me too  that was for monies already paid to you.					2016-11-30T23:44:33+0000	1480549473	2016-12-01 00:44:33	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After having a really bad day yesterday as well as feeling unwell  on returning an item for a refund I realised I couldn t locate my bank card although I had used it 10 minutes earlier in a different shop.  The kind girl on customer services contacted the shop I had previously been in and confirmed I had left it in the chip & pin machine in error.  I left Tesco to go and collect my card and on my return the lovely girl not only carried out the transaction I wanted but had written a lovely card and produced a bottle of wine and instructed me to go home and put my feet up!  It was such a totally unexpected act of kindness xx					2016-11-30T23:09:26+0000	1480547366	2016-12-01 00:09:26	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

For example  your Tesco  tangy & refreshing 50% Fruit Juice Orange squash . Opened a new bottle and the first mouthful of the drink immediately left a peculiar  and unpleasant  taste in my mouth  which I recognised as an artificial sweetener - Sucralose to be precise.  I had not noticed the  new recipe  tag  or I would have checked closer before buying it.  I also think the other tag on the bottle (pictured below) is misleading  as Sucralose is an artificial flavour (sweeteners are a flavour to most people)!!!!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15192595_10210017091777461_7334802167780208302_n.jpg?oh=58664794068a9600944796a2b8ac97a7&oe=58D8A14B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15192595_10210017091777461_7334802167780208302_n.jpg?oh=8581899d5f97b8c3e7126e7ca1d6030c&oe=58EB5346	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210017091777461&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-30T21:13:29+0000	1480540409	2016-11-30 22:13:29	0	10	0	0	10	10	2	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As this takes about 3-4 mins to cook and even less time to devour  it s the perfect choice. So it would seem  whilst tucking into my meal I came across 2 strands of plastic. Probably completely harmless if consumed but nevertheless probably the furthest thing from a vegetable. I shall be sending these to the store which I bought the tin of vegetable curry from and hope I never come across this situation again. Many thanks!					2016-11-30T19:34:01+0000	1480534441	2016-11-30 20:34:01	1	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

I m not sure which store this lady came from  but what a ⭐️ today as I left to pick up my daughter up from nursery in Desborough  Northamptonshire. I walked past my elderly neighbour and a delivery driver from Tescos was talking to him. I realised something had happened so stopped to ask if all was ok. My poor neighbour had fallen off of his scooter and it had landed on top of him (thankfully just bruised and nothing broken) the lady driver had stopped and helped him up  picked his scooter up and spent a good few minutes talking to him and even came back to check on him after she had made her deliveries! What a wonderful lady! Thank you for taking time out of your day to show compassion for someone that really needed help. There are some very Wonderful people in this world 😀 ❤️					2016-11-30T19:05:05+0000	1480532705	2016-11-30 20:05:05	35	10	37	3	50	10	7	3	20	0	34	2	0	0	0	0	0

My mother fainted in the store and they handled the situation brilliantly. They arranged for a wheelchair to take her out of the way  brought a blanker and arranged for paramedics to come. They also waited until they arrived. I had my young son in the trolley and my daughter in a pram and they also had a lovely staff member come and assist me with my children and trolley to the tills and back to my car.

She s arthritic  blind in one eye and about 50% vision in the other and has recently had a few accidents with hot kettles so we thought a coffee machine would be useful. And we told her her nearest shop  Tesco in Carlton  sells the pods so should be ok for easy access.  I got a call off her today to pick some pods up from asda cos she can t make sense of the Tesco prices after struggling to see the SELs in the first place. So i nipped in and just across a single range of pods there was 3 different comparative prices. Per 100g  per unit or per kg. Is this really the best you can do? Don t you believe in clarity and clear pricing for your customers? I have put pictures in the comments   Maybe it was a stroke of luck as I ve now been told they re on offer at Asda	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15241165_598218753700173_8992550876201230820_n.jpg?oh=2483f60d97bd040ea85d918674e9bbe5&oe=591E5078	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15241165_598218753700173_8992550876201230820_n.jpg?oh=c8c1d98d52ece599c77eba2448a5379d&oe=59183387	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=598218753700173&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-30T15:34:13+0000	1480520053	2016-11-30 16:34:13	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in at 5:30am today very tired after a sleepless night with my daughter and grandson at Sheffield Children s Hospital. I needed clothes for my daughter and grandson and other essentials they did not have  as my grandson  had been admitted as an emergency the night before. This lovely lady Riz took me around the store suggesting what I may need and being a tremendous help. It is wonderful to find a person like this - a complete stranger - who can restore your faith in humanity.  Thank you :)					2016-11-30T15:02:28+0000	1480518148	2016-11-30 16:02:28	22	4	22	2	28	4	4	0	3	0	22	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was desperately trying to find a santa list present so I checked online  spoke to local stores  they checked stock of other stores  I spoke to the central telephone line 4 times and I messaged on FB. Supposedly the item wasn t made in the size I wanted (even though I d seen it in that size in store previously!!)  and when that point was conceded  I was told it was completely out of stock throughout the whole country. One quick FB ask to friends and family and I was found one in Kent. How come Tesco couldn t find me one in their own stores but the mother in law could?! If your stock system can t give you a correct answer  I would rather know that than be told a lie. If I had taken your answer at face value I would have had a very unhappy little girl on Christmas morning					2016-11-30T14:51:25+0000	1480517485	2016-11-30 15:51:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why is it that I pay for an hour slot for my convenience  and this morning your driver arrives 40 minutes BEFORE the beginning of it. I m in the shower  my husband is having breakfast. Then to make it worse a can of coke has leaked all over my shopping and my carpet  then I notice my 6 pack of sparkling water (the heavy stuff which is why I use you!) has not been delivered. It s on my order but the driver has no idea why it is not in the van. This is truly horrible service.

Whats the plan tesco ?

Sim free phone less than 12months old has developed known hardware faults and Tesco wants me to do a software reset to see if that solves the problem before sending it off for repair. Do they provide a loan phone? Do they f. I work on site and away from the office everyday and need constant access to phone. Not happy. All I want to do now is just return my phone for a refund.					2016-11-30T13:52:48+0000	1480513968	2016-11-30 14:52:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m wondering if you are able to do something wonderful   my nan was given this tin  it s musical and the tune plays we wish you a merry Christmas and the little penguins spin round and my nan loves this little tin.  She s kept it out all year and takes great pleasure watching her great grandchildren playing it for her as she s not in the best of health and can t quite manage to turn it any more.  Sadly it s broken  we ve tried to fix it but we can t and it no longer plays. My nan was really sad about it when she realised and I m hoping maybe somewhere some how you might still have this tin .... I d pay of course   I m not expecting you to replace it but I m desperate to find her one.  I ve attached some pictures  I really hope you can help me cheer her up.

Said member of staff made no attempt to chat  being from a background in customer service  this is a vital aspect of any customer facing role  and really makes a difference to the experience from the consumers view.   Said member of staff was too interested in staring at their own hands and picking the skin around their nails to engage in even  I assume  essential  Tesco  chat. I wasn t asked if I had a clubcard  I handed this to the member of staff and it was promptly snatched out my hands  scanned and thrown back to me  I wasn t asked if I needed any bags  on this occasion I did need to purchase a 5p bag  so had to ask for this. Price of my shop was rudely grunted at me  with no eye contact  and hand held out in anticipation for money. I asked to pay by card and again was grunted approval of this.   There was no thank you  no see you later  nothing  there was nothing...   As a company working mainly in customer service  I feel certain members of your direct customer facing team need vast improvement and training on their skills.   I am not asking for a full life story and to find out what the member of staff serving me had for dinner on Monday last week and where they are off on holidays next year  but I do feel it would equate to a much more pleasant shopping experience  if your staff at least tried to engage with their customers. I appreciate everyone has bad days  days they don t want you talk to people  they may be ill  be suffering from personal issues or potentially just had a right rollicking from a senior member of staff  but unfortunately  from my experience  when you are serving customers  especially face to face  you have to push this aside.   I m not going to say I won t shop here again  I know I will  leading a busy life and with the shop mere moments from my front door  I do lean towards the convenience  I can only hope next time I spend money in your store  the next member of staff who serves me will be a vast improvement on the last.					2016-11-30T12:34:52+0000	1480509292	2016-11-30 13:34:52	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am sure your employee handbook does not inform staff to give unwanted advice to parents  my daughter was wrapped up warmly with a hat  coat  blanket etc. I was very taken aback by her comment when she should really be focusing on scanning my items through the till. I would have had a word with the manager but he wasn t in  I did advise her not to tell me what I should / shouldn t be doing with my child as she is a very well looked after little girl. I have had a lot of people telling me to complain about this incident so here I am. Not sure what you would want to do with this but I don t expect that sort of service when I come into Tesco and I m appalled that she had the cheek to come out with such a statement.					2016-11-30T12:23:36+0000	1480508616	2016-11-30 13:23:36	0	2	0	1	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Could you please clarify your substitutions policy? on several occasions I have ordered items to have them substitute  admittedly for a lower priced similar item  but usually for a much lower quantity. Example: today  2 packs of Tesco sausage meat 800g total  substituted with 1 pack Tesco finest  350g. Totally unsuitable for what I wanted to use it for and actually more expensive per 100g!					2016-11-30T11:44:38+0000	1480506278	2016-11-30 12:44:38	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ve been lied to repeatedly about delivery dates by Tesco Kidderminster. At the beginning of November  we were told that the store has non food deliveries Friday night/ Saturday morning and Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. The woman on customer services even checked the expected delivery contents of the delivery expected that night and showed us that they were anticipating a small number of the toys. We got to the store at 00:05 and asked a woman on the shop floor to check the delivery for us (it had clearly been delivered as they were unpacking it in the aisles) and she said that had nothing had been delivered for the toy section at all and that they don t get toy deliveries on Friday nights and that it would be Monday at the earliest. So we found the woman from customer services and told her what had happened. She apologised and said that the manager of the of the toy department had confirmed they were expecting a delivery on that night.  She offered to get us the night manager but by this point it was nearly 01:00 and and we wanted to go home.  Monday morning we go in and asked if any Hatchimals had been delivered overnight in the delivery. We were told that the store didn t have non food deliveries on Sunday night/Monday morning.   We left it a couple of weeks. Last week  we asked customer services if any had been delivered. The woman told us that they had had one delivered in the previous week  but the best day to ask would be Wednesday because that s delivery day. We told her about what had happened earlier in the month so she rang the warehouse and they confirmed that non food deliveries -including toys - were Friday night/Saturday morning and Tuesday night/Wednesday morning.  Last Wednesday  my dad goes in at 04:50  en route to work  and asks if any had been delivered. He got told that they don t have deliveries for toys on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning and to try Friday.  My dad goes in Friday  as suggested  and asks if any Hatchimals had been delivered. The person on customer services says that Friday isn t a delivery day and that he should have come in Wednesday as they had a delivery in the night because that s their toy delivery date and they had DEFINITELY had some delivered.  Now  in the grand scheme of things  not being able to get a toy is hardly the end of the world. Would it be nice to be able to get one? Of course it would  but nobody is going to die and the world is going to carry on spinning. However  the lying is not acceptable. I suspect the staff were probably witholding them and your withdrawal from stores will probably remedy this  but why feel the need to lie in the first place? If they weren t doing anything wrong  then surely there wasn t a need to lie to us and lead us along?  It would be less infuriating if the journey to the store wasn t a 10 mile round trip  or if the mistake had only happened once.					2016-11-30T11:02:22+0000	1480503742	2016-11-30 12:02:22	1	4	1	5	10	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can t go to bed because if someone does turn up with the order my dog will start barking and wake up the kids.  Nobody has bothered to phone to say the order isn t being delivered. This is ridiculous.  The customer service guy said all he could do was book me a slot for tomorrow evening now and give me a £15 voucher for the inconvenience but it still doesn t solve the problem.

I cut my finger and obviously now need to arrange for a replacement/top segment. I would have thought the package would have been labelled handle with care due to the black glass material that was used for the top. I think you should contact the delivery company as I handled the stand with care and only moved it two feet from where it was delivered.  Can someone get back to asap in regards to getting a replacement sent out.   This is the second Black Friday I have used Tesco direct and the first was a nightmare.

To say I am disappointed is an understatement!  I ordered a gift for my friends little boy on 17th Nov  the email stated it would be delivered 19th Nov! I then received a text and email advising me that the product was in store! I went to the store (Falkirk) on the 20th Nov with my 3 month old baby (with temp -2) outside to be advised it was not in the store! The lady checked other stores nearby just in case but said no  not in any store!  I called cust serv on the 21st Nov  the lady advised me this was a courier error! She said she could either refund or re order  was this was for a gift I asked for it to be re ordered  she guaranteed me it would be in the store the following day (22nd Nov)! This wasn t the case!!  I received an email on the 23rd Nov advising me it would be delivered on the 26th Nov!  Today I went to the store to collect and guess what.... no parcel there! The lady kindly checked and told me it was at FennyLock (which I ve never heard off)! So back home I go (again having to waste petroleum  time and taking my baby out the house in cold weather)   I phone customer services (the guy on the phone sounded like he couldn t care less) told me that this was unsuccessfully delivered to the store but didn t know why! I advised this is the 2nd time this has happened (I can t understand as it s a 24 hour store) and asked to speak to complaints department!  I then speak to a lady (turned out the guy hadn t done a warm transfer) who I had to tell my story to again  she advised oh I am not the right person to be dealing with this and put me through to another guy (this time doing a warm handoff)! He advised me that he didn t think he was the right person either  so I explain my story again (for the 3RD time)! He then says he can only apologise and will order the goods again! I advised him this is the first and last time I will use Tesco online and could I complain! He advised me Tesco do not have a complaints department (which I find VERY hard to believe) but he gave me a customer journey email address (yes it will outline my journey but won t resolve my complaint)! I asked the guy when my product would be in store  he couldn t tell me and said it will be on your email  but normally takes 2 days to arrive but can take longer! So after 40 minutes on the phone and speaking to 3 different people my complaint has not been resolved so the only other option is go to social media! So Tesco I am looking for the following: - why on 2 occasions has my parcel been undelivered to a 24 hour store? - why is there no complaints department? - how are you going to restore me as a customer shopping with you again? - what are you doing about my inconvenience? - what are you doing to ensure my perception arrives in the store?   I look forward to hearing from you soon  failure to do so I will be taking this further!  Thanks					2016-11-29T21:23:38+0000	1480454618	2016-11-29 22:23:38	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will not bore you with all the details but it has been a very long 4 weeks with lots of phone calls to and throw. Real shame that throughout this process one of your Tech staff were very rude on 2 separate occasions and spoke to me like something on the bottom of his shoe !  It s a shame it took over 4 weeks to get a replacement ( not able to collect until Thursday)  but certainly wouldn t want any other customer enduring this process again with Samsung and the number of let downs we went through. Definitely needs improving on that side of things with Samsung.  Thank you Phil again though and thanks for all your help .					2016-11-29T21:18:09+0000	1480454289	2016-11-29 22:18:09	0	4	0	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But fear not fair tesco Warriors it ends on a high!!! Today (29/11/2016) at 6pm my partner went to collect the weekly shop from your click and collect colletts drive Cheltenham. However disaster soon arose when we realised to our horror half our shopping was missing! Especially the toilet rolls cos come on have you had two toddlers and no toilet roll??? We briefly considered calling in MI5 batman iron man or even Darth Vader.... But instead we sufficed with an amaze balls duty manager called James Williams who was our superhero! He went above and beyond to find what happened to our shopping.... After determining that it had not been abducted by aliens  held hostage or held under protest it was in fact determined the packer  forgot  half the printed list (he or she was obviously pre engaged with end of the world matters and the survival dynamic as a whole).. Any way James in his super cape had a van to us within the hour with said missing items and even magicked up a box of choccies for the problems we faced. The customer service we faced was of super cape standard and may you long keep it up!!!  #tesco					2016-11-29T20:39:30+0000	1480451970	2016-11-29 21:39:30	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Been on the phone all day  been lied to about what time it s coming and it s still not here. I ve now got to wait until 10 o clock tonight to see if it comes. Takeaway purchased for dinner... lunch brought tomorrow rather than making it. Not happy 😡😡😡😡					2016-11-29T20:05:54+0000	1480449954	2016-11-29 21:05:54	1	5	2	0	7	5	5	0	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Yo Tom  fancy some maccies and a trip to Tesco?  Tom replies   mate  after all the shots last night you would be a life saver but don t drive like a loon  bowels aren t the best!  And off we pop! We had a lovely date at maccies ordering our scran and taking the biscuit out of all the cretins in the restaurant even though we looked pretty sketty ourselves. As we get to Tesco all is well  there are copies of battlefield 1 on the shelves  also the price! Fantastic I thought  I shall have much fun when I get home shooting people in the ham flower! Only when we took the box to the checkout and the lady went to get the game she came back with the worst news!  I m sorry we are out of stock! . I was most annoyed with an almighty  oooohhhh nnnnnooooo! . What made it more annoying is that the woman that served us said and I quote  we should of put an  out of stock  sticker on shouldn t we? . This I find is unacceptable  and thought I would share this uplifting but then soul destroying experience with you! You have just contrabuted to 7 miles of emmisions from my car for this error!

I had an IOU voucher to collect a paw patroller as needed 3 on the 3 for 2 deal but only had 2 in stock. Called and turns out they won t be getting anymore stock and that s that! Had a sleepless night worrying about it. Called customer services and was told to visit the store as it s up to their discretion. I visited the store which is not near me at all! And was advised all they could do was let me spend the £52 voucher on toys on their store. I didn t want any toys I wanted the paw patroller I had paid for and expected to collect at some point! They were unwilling to offer me cash or let me spend the voucher on other areas of the store. I visited the small toy isle and there was nothing either of my children would be interested in!  I only want a paw patroller!!! I now have a useless £52 voucher and no paw patroller + so I don t disappoint my son Christmas Day I m going to have to go buy 1 in another shop for £60+!!! I work part time and cannot afford this sort of unplanned spend. I thought I had a paw patroller in the bag for Christmas morning. Now I am having unnecessary stress purely because Tesco messed up!					2016-11-29T19:34:13+0000	1480448053	2016-11-29 20:34:13	0	13	0	0	13	13	3	10	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

More quality coming into the house.   Called because the app seems to think I wanted my groceries for tomorrow in pre-booked Christmas slot. Unbeknownst to me the customer service (Joanne who apparently is the top boss over there 🙄  please tell me another lie) tells me that  she couldn t possible change the order back to it s original slot (from 5-10 mins ago).   Could she call the store (that would be Musselburgh) and explain for me.....ABSOLUTELY NOT. That would be a firm no as well.   So basically your app is poor and now I get no food tomorrow or the Christmas slot. BRILLIANT!!!  Please listen to the call (I asked her to repeatedly record it). Where Joanne and Rachael basically didn t try to ease the situation but made it worse (pretty much a   what not to do in a call centre customer service environment)					2016-11-29T17:32:36+0000	1480440756	2016-11-29 18:32:36	2	1	2	1	4	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My family and I love shopping with you guys but we have an issue. My middle son has cerebral palsy and is majorly too big for your baby trolleys now and impossible to get into any other trolley. Meaning that when we come shopping to our local store in Southport  my partner has to push a trolley and my son in his wheelchair which although is doable is hardly practical and impossible if I wanted to take him shopping on my own!  We were wondering if you would consider getting or already had a Firefly chair at this store?

Earlier today I was bragging that I have consumed my first pigs in blankets of the year courtesy of yourselves from the hot deli counter to some friends. A said friend then went on to raise the bragging status and share that she has sampled your  sage and sausage meat wrapped in bacon  pig in blanket from the hot deli counter. I have to tell you this is slightly soul destroying because the only things in ours were hot and spicy sausages (bit bland but ok) pigs in blankets (were very tasty - good sized as well) and some poxy chicken (I say poxy chicken I don t mean chicken had pox. Although that pun was unintentional it wasn t wasted on me) no sage and sausage meat wrapped in bacon pigs in blankets to be seen! Devo d!

I worked for Tesco for 23 years & have been retired for 7 yrs  I am absolutely disgusted by the way  I have been treated I have 6 receipts  waiting to claim my SD back. Tesco don t seem to have any thought for ex-employees  never had to ask for a new sD CARD in all the years I worked for them  Morrisons had more thought for me  I received a beautiful arrangement of flowers/I would have expected Blackburn Tesco  Hill St to help more  How long doI have to wait					2016-11-29T16:04:57+0000	1480435497	2016-11-29 17:04:57	0	10	1	0	11	10	6	4	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

A couple of staff members ran to try and find tissues etc. It wasn t long until a more senior member of staff came and got me a pack of wipes and blue roll. She spoke to my 4 year old daughter who wasnt coping well with seeing the sick! While we went to the baby change  she cleared up and put all my daughters clothes in a bag and even tried to clean her shoes. She found a tshirt for me to wrap her up in and gave me flowers and my older daughter a gift for being brave!  I was in such a tizz that I didn t get her name but I wanted her kindness to be recognised if possible.					2016-11-29T12:59:11+0000	1480424351	2016-11-29 13:59:11	41	1	42	2	45	1	1	0	6	0	41	1	0	0	0	0	0

Saves you a lot of money replacing them too. Stocking them in their appropriate place and handling them sensibly without any problems also helps.					2016-11-29T12:20:04+0000	1480422004	2016-11-29 13:20:04	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered an iPad mini on black Friday morning and you took my money to only later be told you had then cancelled my order. The money is still pending on my account today and have just rang to speak to your customer service team who tell me you have non in stock so I just have to wait for my money to be refunded. I am now left without a Christmas present and as black Friday gas now past no way of getting the same thing at the price I had paid with you. You weren t even willing as the big company that you are to refund me a gesture of good will to cover the cost of now having to buy elsewhere. The best you could offer me was £20 which  isn t anywhere near what I need. I do all my shopping with you and it has made me want to never use your services again. Here I am left paying for a mistake your end. Any of business would foot the bill but not you..the one who can probably afford it!					2016-11-29T11:38:18+0000	1480419498	2016-11-29 12:38:18	1	12	7	0	19	12	7	5	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	6	0

Not because it is better value than anyother store as I think many of the main supermarkets are very much of a muchness.  But for the convenience  it has always been a shop I know and can pop in and out very quickly. Unfortunately today has been a sad day for me. I visited your Long eaton shop to find disorder. I understand that you have felt the need to add more clothes stores which many people I am sure are happy about. What I am unsure about is that I would have thought your main line was as a food provider. This it would appear has unfortunately taken a slip here.  People are struggling to find anything in your store. I am aware that you have had to reshuffle things about to make way for the new clothes but please please could I make just 3 suggestions. 1) Please change the overhead signs so they are actually correct (I for one struggled to understand why Clingfilm and foil is stored on the pet food isle it took me ages to work that one out??) I know there were small signs on the isles telling people where things now are but those seem to have disappeared. 2) Give out a floor plan to your shoppers so that they know where everything now is. 3) Make sure all your staff know where everything is and are happy to show people. This I would have thought was a given but today it took me 3 people to ask before I found out where the cling fulm was. The 1st person wanted to moan about how they had no idea why they were having to change everything around (apparently their not paid for that  something I really didnt want to know) and the 2nd person didn t have a clue.   I hate to moan but maybe a little more pre thinking and organisation would have been better.  I hate to say it but my next shop may well be Asda  if I have no clue where anything is at Tesco anymore I might as well give Asda a shot as many people have recommended them to me and now I don t feel any need to be loyal as I dont need thus hassle  shopping is stressful enough when I know where everything is.					2016-11-29T11:19:09+0000	1480418349	2016-11-29 12:19:09	9	20	10	0	30	19	10	9	21	0	9	0	0	1	0	0	0

The paw patroller. I couldn t afford at nearly £60 so when it was in your 3for2 offer 2 of my friends said they wanted 1 to making it only £35! Hunted for a shop with stock traveled by bus train & another bus with a pram to get there to find only 2 in stock!!! Went to customer services who done an amazing thing so I could still get the deal they done a kind of IOU so I paid for all 3 £105 and left safe in the knowledge I could collect my toy when had stock. I tweeted you to enquirer about stock in certain store as that s where IOU could be redeemed and was advised they had stopped selling it and that was that! Visit the store for a partial refund but it s up to there discretion! So no toy for my son and out of pocket!  I just want the toy! How hard can it be to arrange a 1 off delivery of this toy to the store!?					2016-11-29T00:24:02+0000	1480379042	2016-11-29 01:24:02	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

They all come battered  bruised and generally ruined.  Admittedly only worth £1170 in total  I would have hoped for kinder treatment of your inventory.  Here s the latest evidence.  Unfortunately the warehouse experts ran out of bubble wrap mid-process  so just stuck a whacking great piece of sellotape over the £130 set of lego for good measure.  And yes  that is a dirty great tear to the left of the tape too.  I suppose I could remove the tape and get my colouring pens out to make it look like the tape hasn t ripped all the artwork off the front of the box.  Fortunately the team are going to send me a new one and make a special note to pack it carefully  despite the fact that such a promise was made with this one too!  Let s just say expectations are low at best.  I wonder if tesco direct have come across a revolution in packaging - the humble cardboard box?  Something that amazon mastered many years ago to ensure they don t lose money hand over fist in the same way that tesco clearly must be.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15241267_10153816134986534_6522882042470449176_n.jpg?oh=ed382cc7f463640d80d4e31f5b09cfb8&oe=58EAB353	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15241267_10153816134986534_6522882042470449176_n.jpg?oh=2ed7c3e3448840e80c158250cc17a705&oe=591E6A5E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153816134986534&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-28T23:21:16+0000	1480375276	2016-11-29 00:21:16	0	3	0	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In fact the store where this picture was taken had 10+ homeless persons  sleeping rough on the very same street  it wouldn t have been too much of a bother to hand this food out to them. To add insult to injury so to speak I ve found out that you actually require that the disposed of food in crushed in the bags! Why is this ? So the homeless or those in need don t go looking in the bins? It is such a shame that supermarkets don t utilise there waste food and give it to those who need it. If you can t legally sell it  the food to you is already wasted and so Is the profit  but someone could have it   someone may eat that day and not starve  someone could be given the calories to survive these cold nights. Please can I have a response I will also be emailing your head office regarding this.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15241348_10202446022189323_1218436466369249424_n.jpg?oh=86e012bb29c9694ec0b63f918705f48d&oe=59213F91	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15241348_10202446022189323_1218436466369249424_n.jpg?oh=b8ef3bac9331b63e1fd02c640005dfcb&oe=58E72C77	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202446022189323&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-28T23:14:37+0000	1480374877	2016-11-29 00:14:37	3	5	4	0	9	5	3	2	1	0	3	1	0	0	0	0	0

I didn t keep the receipt so they won t refund  which is fair enough I suppose. I bought all 3 kids shoes for September and less than a term into wearing them Ivana had worn through at the bottom and stitching broken at the back  Jack and Theodore s shoes were worn down and split underneath  you could clearly feel the square supports underfoot and the velcro was coming up on both sets.

As I have a disability the shop and scan makes shopping easier  but after shopping in this store since it opened in get refused by the scan machine. Asked a member of staff for help only to be told I must have not scanned an item on a previous shop. I felt totally humiliated like she was insinuating that I had stollen. Unfortunately no one could help with the error that was showing on the scan screen and I was forced to shop without the scanner  this made my shopping experience twice as long and caused my disability more pain than needed.

He was beyond delighted and couldn t believe he actually had it at home in his garden. He s been out in it all day  in the dark and up early checking on it  inviting everyone he can think of to come for a shot.   Christmas spirit at its absolute best.

I usually check dates  as the stock rotation  especially in the dairy aisles is a bit hit and miss at the store as it is.

Thanks.   I put in an order for a gazebo to keep two primary school choirs dry if the weather turns during our charity event on Friday.  It said it would be delivered within 2-5 days. Once I had clicked through and paid  it changed its delivery time to 8 days! Thats 3 days after the event so useless to me. I understand that you are dealing with a lot of black friday orders  but please  please ensure your website gives the correct details! Changing a delivery date after payment is  unethical at best and probably illegal.  To make it worse  when I clicked through to cancel  it wouldn t let me click the  give a reason  button and wouldn t let me cancel the order without clicking it. So when I desperately need to be finding a gazebo elsewhere  from a company who will deliver when they say they will  I had to spend time on your automated phone system  then waiting to speak to a manager because your call centre staff said a refund wouldn t clear for 3-5 days!  An absolute joke!   #tescolies #unethical #blackfriday					2016-11-28T18:14:52+0000	1480356892	2016-11-28 19:14:52	0	8	1	0	9	8	3	5	5	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Such a lovely fit and lovely style however the amount of glitter it leaves everywhere is ridiculous!! My bedroom was covered as well as my lounge and hall  I then went outside to brush off as much as I could  covering my garden path in the process! My car got absolutely covered and in the restaurant it looked like I had had an explosion of fairy dust! I couldn t even sit down at my relatives after the meal for the fear of leaving her with a mammoth hoovering job! I dread to think what my washing machine is going to look like after I wash it!

I dont use Tesco much anymore as I prefer Aldi for my essentials  but today I thought I d like a few nicer things  along with wanting to use the in-store optician and chemist.  I tried to make an appointment for a routine eye test to be told that they could offer 7 December IF they ve managed to recruit an optician in time.  Next  on to the chemist.  They said they re attempting to recruit a pharmasist and have a part-time locum who works there 9-3 (so exactly the hours people are at work).  So not only did I not get a renewal on my viagra prescription  my eyesignt prevents me from seeing whether it s working.  Every Little Helps?

I bought the correct size for his measured feet only to find  after trying on a pair at home  that they were absolutely massive.              I didn t  unpack  any more of them and decided to put them to one side for him to grow into and purchased another pack in the smaller size on my next visit.           He has now outgrown/worn out of the smaller ones so I got the larger pack out of the draw. Again they were still really big even though his feet have obviously grown a lot.                                        I cut the rest of the packaging (the plastic bits that hold all of the pairs together) off of the pack this weekend only to discover that there were 2 different sizes in the pack. On closer inspection there were actually 3 different sizes!!! (Even though they all say the same size in them!)                                                                                    Obviously he needs more than a couple of pairs that fit to see him through the week which is why I went to return them today and hopefully end up with 1 pack (7 pairs) of all the same size socks.                  First of all the lady on customer service desk disputed the obvious size differences but said if I wasn t happy then to go and get another pack.                                                                                  On returning with a pack of socks she started shaking her head at me. The reason for this was that there were no socks there that resembled the school socks that I was returning - the only grey school socks were ribbed and only had 5 pairs in the pack (2 pairs less - which I was prepared to accept).                                                                                               So due to not having kept the receipt or the outer cardboard packaging (for over a year and not realising the socks weren t all the same size)  she said they couldn t exchange them and that was the end of it.           I understand that not having the receipt or barcode makes things more difficult but the socks all have  F&F  in them with the size and obviously haven t been worn.                                                                                                                             I would be extremely grateful if someone could help me with this matter as when I purchased the original pack  I did not receive a complete pack of the same size socks as stated.   Regards  Helen x					2016-11-28T17:15:20+0000	1480353320	2016-11-28 18:15:20	2	26	2	0	28	26	7	19	7	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

In view of the fact that your company emailed my daughter allegedly by you as a priority customer the slots for booking Christmas Eve delivery and she could not get a slot because you say YOU DONT DELIVER XMAS EVE which meant she missed out on an earlier slot for her xmas shop.  There is nothing you can do it was an error.  What a disgraceful way to treat loyal customers who spend a lot of money with you on a weekly basis.  It is difficult for her to get to the other side of Lincoln with three young children and being pregnant with her third which is why she uses online shopping.  Your customer services have solved nothing in this case and all you have done is removed my opinion.  Is that the best you can do. really???					2016-11-28T16:28:07+0000	1480350487	2016-11-28 17:28:07	1	30	2	1	33	30	7	23	40	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Why  why  why Tescos? It is a very nasty preservative responsible for allergies of an epidemic scale!! I have a bottle at home which is  free-from  but on Sunday I looked at the label in-shop and saw the dreaded word. The only alternatives (there are only two free of MI) are either over £1 or £2 which is a bit rubbish seeing as your own costs under 50p!!  Please  Google  this allergy. It is very nasty and often affects people who have never suffered from sensitive skin. It is essentially a poison and can cause nerve damage and digestive problems as well as the classic skin/ mucous membrane problems....It is basically a cheaper alternative whose use should be restricted to paint and industrial lubricants. However it is now put into cosmetics and even in baby products....					2016-11-28T16:23:28+0000	1480350208	2016-11-28 17:23:28	0	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

When I got the confirmation email from the partner company today I noticed that it was £11 cheaper to order from them direct.  I rang your customer line and was advised to refuse the delivery and that I would be fully refunded and could order from the partner company direct.  When I spoke to the partner company to reorder they advised me that if I did this they would charge for the return and it would end up costing me more!  So now I m not sure who is right?					2016-11-28T16:14:53+0000	1480349693	2016-11-28 17:14:53	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would appreciate if curry and rice would be provided in a can instead of separately in a food tray. It s more convenient to empty the contents on to a plate before heating the curry in the microwave and then ready for consumption.					2016-11-28T14:53:28+0000	1480344808	2016-11-28 15:53:28	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve recently moved and totally forgot to change the adress with everything going on plus my 6month old son has been poorly! The driver said that usually what would happen is that I would have to re order my shopping to get delivered again  but the money wouldn t go back in my account for 3 days! My heart sank as I spent up the last of my money on the shopping and I don t get paid until Wednesday. The delivery driver said that as he could see I ordered baby food and nappies he would phone his boss and see what he could do (this was without me explaining my situation) he then phoned back and asked me for my adress. This lovely man then came and delivered my shopping still with a huge smile on his face even though it was completely out of his was for his next job! I would like to say a huge thank you and for this man to get some recognition as I know for some it might not seem huge but for me it s made a massive difference between being ok and struggling until Wednesday.

Seriously I m going to stop doing my shop there. Fresh veg and fruit with only two days date!!! The dates have got worse over the last few months. Even the staff there don t understand. Packs of three onions and in every single pack the middle one is rotten. I bought a pack with three that looked ok and low and behold the middle one is rotten. Bread with today s date is stale and dry!!!We have a Lidl opening near us in he next few days. And so far that s where the shoppings going to be done. Seriously not good enough Tesco.					2016-11-28T13:58:17+0000	1480341497	2016-11-28 14:58:17	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have posted a picture of the product in the comments as for some reason I could only attach 1 picture to the post. The pack states low allergy but this is obviously not the case. He has been wearing other plasters with no ill effects! I bought these ones as they have monkeys on them and he was more willing to wear a plaster. Big mistake!! There is no email address or telephone number on the box to send a complaint to.

I suspect tech has moved on  I wonder what kind of a difference it would make if every store had solar panels and you added more every year.  100 sq m per store is 1000Kw/ hour in full sunlight with 500 stores that is a lot of electricity.			https://www.tescoplc.com/assets/files/cms/Resources/zero_carbon_stores.pdf	tescoplc.com	2016-11-28T12:45:14+0000	1480337114	2016-11-28 13:45:14	0	12	0	0	12	12	4	8	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please  please  please can I politely suggest that your Meir Park  Stoke on Trent store put some baby trollies by the actual parent and child spaces? Having to maul a travel seat with a 3month old in whilst trying to safely maneoevre a 4yr old to the opposite side of the car park is becoming somewhat frustrating. Not to mention when you get the bay to find they are right at the back and have to battle your way through to retrieve one! Thank you so kindly!! Oh and finally  to the store colleagues- smoking by the side of the store s parent and child spaces not only looks unprofessional but is disgusting to walk children through too.

I ve worked in an in store bakery before so how could no one notice that especially when bagging them up!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15267949_10208092650979551_1653529317789539166_n.jpg?oh=e12ba514b9ce9bf7e565ff0f740e488d&oe=58E1F42A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15267949_10208092650979551_1653529317789539166_n.jpg?oh=6b2535c6de6bee1a0126ab164a0ceae1&oe=59186627	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208092650979551&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-28T10:13:42+0000	1480328022	2016-11-28 11:13:42	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Food  which should be refrigerated is left out for long periods while other non-refrigeration items are shelved in order of priority (Weird!!). I have photo evidence of this. Then there is a person on checkout about whom I have had cause to complain more than once. He packs bags with soft items being crushed beneath heavier items making some foods look inedible. What s the point of purchasing nicely presented foods in nice packaging if they re going to be squashed into a lump of slop when I reach home?! This evening I went to the sane store with a friend who bought a Tesco Finest Chicken Madeira. This stupid individual (I can only imagine) must have thought it clever to scan the barcode and then flip the item several times before placing it in a bag resulting in the item being entirely spoiled. I was furious at this! Why is this person still employed by Tesco??!! Other staff have commented too about him and his slack attitude. Somehow I will find a way to go very public about this store. I m not kidding either!!					2016-11-27T21:37:49+0000	1480282669	2016-11-27 22:37:49	1	35	1	0	36	35	5	30	27	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Placed an order last week 3 for 2 on toys. 1 email to say part of order has been dispatched then another to say the other order had been dispatched. Went to collect today from click and collect to find that 1 part of the order was actually 2 quilts 2 pillows and 2 bins. As you can imagine I was annoyed. Phoned customer service to be told that 1 of the toys was now out of stock. Said that you will set me up for stock alerts but no guarantee this would be before Christmas or a refund so went for the refund. Said you would refund me the monies for that item to look at my emails to see that you are only refunding me half the price as I was now not eligible for the 3 for 2. Furious is not the word can t get the toy anywhere else and not having 3 for 2 plus expecting me to wait in 7am till 7pm on my only day off work for a courier to collect the parcel that was incorrectly sent by yourselves. Absolute shambles I have order lots from tesco but can say you have lost my custom and will be telling friends and family about my experience #unhappycustomer					2016-11-27T21:19:26+0000	1480281566	2016-11-27 22:19:26	3	2	6	0	8	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	1	0	0	2	0

Whilst in Tesco 4 nights ago I saw a ponsietta covered in glitter at the till as an impulse buy . As never owning a plant in my life I decided to buy after reading the inscructions . I got really excited when it said guaranteed to last the festive period and thought to myself what could go wrong ! 4 days later it s dying on me 😐. I know it likes the warm   so I ve had the heating on for it and when it was starting to look sorry for itself I plonked in front of the fire but it s still giving up on me . As for water if I give it anymore it s either gonna drown or I m going to cause a drought in winter and if I m not careful the waterboard will be looking for an underground leak . One friend Karen Mycroft accused me of pre-meditated murder but I can assure you I bought this plant with good intentions ! Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep this plant alive so it can at least see one happy Christmas ? P.s this is the reason I m not allowed pet fish either because they die in my care 😂😂😂	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15219417_10154615973185520_2248529902870901336_n.jpg?oh=5f4b99522a12730febe6764e9e955300&oe=58E5BD74	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15219417_10154615973185520_2248529902870901336_n.jpg?oh=af89a08f653f2d327519b8ef18b32833&oe=58E93479	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154615973185520&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-27T18:39:30+0000	1480271970	2016-11-27 19:39:30	3	27	7	0	34	27	10	17	3	0	3	2	0	2	0	0	0

Why did you not email me or text me as per usual to let me know the christmas slots would be opening? I came to the page to check as I had been awaiting an email and thought it odd that I had heard nothing  and here I get  to find that everyone has already got their slots? Great. One very unhappy customer here  I always recommend the delivery saver programme to peopleand this is the major reason. I think next year I will be shopping elsewhere instead. Not happy. Last year waiting up until 3am was bad enough  no w this?					2016-11-27T18:28:53+0000	1480271333	2016-11-27 19:28:53	0	8	0	0	8	8	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got a voice mail today at 12pm saying he was in the area and if we wanted it earlier we could  I tried ringing him back but no reply. So we waited until our hour slot  we then got a text saying there will be a delay of an hour. Which was taking the time to 4.08pm. It got to 4.30pm and the shopping still hasn t arrived  we rang the customer helpline and they just said they couldn t get hold of the shop nor driver and to wait to see if it came in the next hour and that they would keep trying to ring them to find out what was happening. After a couple more phone calls of them having no idea where my shopping is and no explanation they asked me to re-schedule.( baring in mind we do our shop for every Sunday  so we have no food or anything in the house. ) I have been advised to re-schedule but not helpful to me  I decided to cancel my whole shop because I am disappointed with the service that I have had to deal with today  I have never had a problem before so I am very disappointed. Suppose to be out for a meal with my family for my birthday tonight and I have not been able to go. It s a Sunday night and not many shops open. I hope this doesn t happen to anyone else  it s a real inconvenience.					2016-11-27T18:25:46+0000	1480271146	2016-11-27 19:25:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Shopping yesterday with my 10 month old in the trolley  all was well and I thought she might fall asleep on the way round. However  as I picked up the last item on my list she began crying  I picked her up for a cuddle but this did not appease her. She wanted only one thing  and that was to be breastfed. Now  I m not particularly shy or bothered about feeding in public  but with her show down she had created quite an audience. Non the less  I pulled my trolley over to the end of the frozen aisle and began feeding hoping she d be quick and I wouldn t be in anyone s way. After about two minutes I looked up to see a few members of staff approach me  as if reading my mind they offered me to get me a chair to sit down on so I could continue feeding her in comfort. I was so pleased I could have cried! Not only for the chair  but for the acknowledgement and acceptance of normalizing breastfeeding in public! Well done Tesco! Top marks to your staff 👍👏😊 xxx					2016-11-27T18:10:12+0000	1480270212	2016-11-27 19:10:12	15	1	15	0	16	1	1	0	1	0	15	0	0	0	0	0	0

Once I arrived at the store my 5 year old son spent 10 minutes deciding which one he wanted before we made our way to the self service till to complete our purchase. Having queued for 5minutes it was our turn next  scanned product and it came up on the till unrecognised item. The assistant came across  who then called someone else over to find the code to put it through the till. We were left waiting a further 10minutes for the assistant to return to tell us that they are unable to sell us the £18 iPad case as it won t scan on the till.  If you have children you will understand how upset my son was that he couldn t buy the item he wanted and the fact that we had spent 10 minutes waiting for some to come to the conclusion that we just couldn t by it. The Tesco staff in the store didn t seem interested in making the customer happy or in fact that the were losing a sale. I don t understand why you have products on sale if you won t sell them.  We returned home minus a case  resulting in a iPad that is still unprotected  one very upset child  1hr of our time wasted and 10miles travelled for no reason.  I would be very interested to hear your thoughts on this and if it is standard practice??					2016-11-27T16:43:56+0000	1480265036	2016-11-27 17:43:56	3	12	4	0	16	12	6	6	8	0	3	0	0	0	0	1	0

You re even using the same made up farm name Woodside Farms on both and we all know there s no Woodside Farms.  It s sad to see the shelves full of bacon from Denmark in your stores why aren t you pushing British produce more than imported?

Over the last few weeks there seems to have been lots of items labelled  out of stock  on the shelves  or just persistently empty spaces and no label. Some examples being; GF Naan Bread  GF Pitta Bread  GF Stuffing Mix  Frozen GF Yorkies  amongst many others.  Is there a supply problem  or are you downsizing your range?  Hope it is not the latter as  using the stuffing for example  there are literally dozens of alternatives if one of the normal (i.e. contains gluten) ones is out of stock  but with the GF one that is not an option.					2016-11-27T16:14:16+0000	1480263256	2016-11-27 17:14:16	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now I m here because the replacement has decided it no longer wants to turn on! Yes I know it is over the 12 month warranty  but let s face it  no one buys a TV and only expects it to last 15 months which means I m sure you ll agree this would not be classed as the TV lasting a reasonable length of time as the sale of goods act states it should. Hopefully this can be resolved quickly and easily or I ll have to consider setting my son up with his Ps4 using a display tv in our local Tesco store instead of my living room TV so that Tesco staff can better understand why this needs to be resolved!					2016-11-27T15:55:36+0000	1480262136	2016-11-27 16:55:36	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These two everyday items cost me £6.50. If I was to buy these items not gluten free it would have cost me £3.00. So I want to ask you why am I being charged over twice as much for having to eat gluten free products? If you are unaware  eating Gluten Free means you have an auto-immune disease called Celiac Disease  eating Gluten when you have Celiac disease means your body attacks your small intestine and in turn damages your digestive track leading to both long and short terms health problems ranging from vomiting  cramping and excessive bathroom use  to lasting damage to your digestive track and an inability to absorb nutrients from foods. It is not a choice  nor is it a fad diet.  An average supermarket stocks 80 000 different lines  your frozen gluten free section is two bays wide. And yet these are the products you have chosen to charge an extortionate amount on knowing full well that if a person with Celiac disease wants the modern convenience of a frozen pizza or chicken nuggets  they will have no choice but to spend over twice as much.   This not only goes for Gluten Free products  but also Lactose free and other items that you stock that adhere to people with food intolerances and allergies. Please explain to me why I feel like I am being discriminated against over a health issue I have no control over.					2016-11-27T14:55:43+0000	1480258543	2016-11-27 15:55:43	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Made a special visit there today  battled the ques to get in and park kids in tow went to buy a tablet in the black Friday offer qued to pay with my clubcard  I wanted to use the money towards my purchase only to be told that i needed the voucher printed. So lost my place in the que went to find the printer machine... it was out of order ... asked the customer service lady what can be done? Her reply ... nothing. There is nothing tesco could do to help. The machine had been offline since last night and wasnt working. When i explained that wasnt my fault and asked if they could help me find another way round it i was told  go ask over there  so again i went to ask somebody else if they could help and was told to go home and print them myself. GREAT STUFF! Now bearing in mind our family spend thousands of pounds a year in that shop on our groceries and homeware AND the fact that I had the clubcard in hand I find it absolutely obsurd that no one was willing to help. I am appalled at the system or lack of systems that you have in place.  One machine that if it breaks in the biggest event of the year there isn t a back up or an alternative route to help your customers. So with two young children and one wasted journey I feel truly disappointed. Tesco can have all the high tech fruit smoking machines and expensive posh bakerys in the world but what matters most to a business like yours is providing excellent customer service and I m afraid to say Tesco Watford doesn t.					2016-11-27T14:45:44+0000	1480257944	2016-11-27 15:45:44	6	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Rather than stop their conversation they carried on chatting while scanning our shopping through. No hello  not even an acknowledgment of our existence until our final 3 items when one of the staff in question wandered off. Not the first time for bad customer service. And not even a goodbye. Awful.					2016-11-27T14:43:09+0000	1480257789	2016-11-27 15:43:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The last three weeks there have been no slots left when normally they are. No slots available until very late Wednesday. I normally do my shop on a Sunday for a Monday delivery! I have kids coming for tea tomorrow and now no food as I have work between now and then!   When will this be resolved as my delivery saver doesn t appear to be offering me much value for money at the moment.					2016-11-27T14:19:47+0000	1480256387	2016-11-27 15:19:47	4	6	4	0	10	6	6	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Rverything was cold!!! As were the chips .which i asked to replaced For hot chips . In the mean time my grandsons meal had arrived at our table minus the chips When we asked the young lady brought a bowl .in the mean time i had eaten the edible parts of my breakfast minus my chips  So i complained after what looked like trying to fimd some one to blame I asked for a refund on the chips that did not arrive . And so becausr of this i shall not be going any near tesco cafe ever again! Im surprised the plaxe managed to pass it s FSA inspection! It was that horrible! I suggest you sort it out or close it down.					2016-11-27T13:10:10+0000	1480252210	2016-11-27 14:10:10	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So naturally he returned it to be inspected by your team.  However not hearing anything back from you he phoned to get an update and apparently the damage has been caused by water  such as taking the phone into the shower!  I can promise you this is not the case!  My husband has not caused this!  Why did no one tell him about this and why were they not going to return the phone?!  Of course now he s insisted they are returning it but how can we now be sure it won t be put in water to back up your claim?!  We are now stuck with a useless contract!!  Apalling service!  My phone through you isn t great either!  Biggest mistake getting our phones through you  never again. We ve never before had this problem so from our point of view Tesco are making up excuses. If we do not hear back we will cancel both contracts  you may maintain were tied in but we agreed to the contract on the basis we had fully functioning phones which they are not  so you ve broken your deal!					2016-11-27T12:15:52+0000	1480248952	2016-11-27 13:15:52	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately less than half way round my son filled his nappy which was unpleasant for him  us and anyone passing him.  So we had to make the decision between changing him on your toilet floor (grim) and finishing our food shop or paying for the few bits we had managed to collect and leaving to go home and changing him.  Pretty obvious which option we picked. So today when we would have spend over £100 in your shop we ended up spending less than £30.  We also would have stayed and had something to eat and drink in Costa Coffee but we couldn t because my son was so upset at being in a dirty nappy we had no choice but to leave. Shame really that you fail to provide better facilities so that he could have had the dignity you and I have and we could have cleaned him up and carried on our day instead of having to cut our trip short and return home where we will now probably stay for the rest of the day because its just easier not to go out. You provide toilets for all your other customers  men  women  children and babies  this store has a large disabled toilet as well.  Yet none of these were suitable for my son (or his friends who live locally) because he is 7 and is severely disabled so your baby changing table is far too small to hold his weight.   Please consider providing an adult sized changing table and a hoist to aid with lifting so that next time we can simply pause our shop and carry on our visit afterwards just like everyone else does.  This would benefit a huge number of people in and around the Worthing area who shop in Tesco - or who don t currently because of the lack of facilities but would like to.					2016-11-27T12:12:32+0000	1480248752	2016-11-27 13:12:32	16	31	20	9	60	31	8	23	23	0	16	1	0	0	2	1	0

These delivery slots were opened on 26th November. Just after midnight on 26th I logged on and there were no slots left. I tried again at 8am  no slots left. I have been a delivery saver customer since it was launched  and use Tesco every week- sometimes twice a week  but you are not going to be able to give me an order at Christmas.  I have logged on to Asda  who I have barely used for years  and with no effort whatsoever I can CHOOSE from the delivery slots on 23rd December.  I think it s plain to see how much Tesco value customer loyalty  so my delivery saver plan will be cancelled  and my business moved to Asda.					2016-11-27T10:15:23+0000	1480241723	2016-11-27 11:15:23	1	8	1	0	9	8	5	3	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought you d have more delivery drivers working  to cope with  the demand.					2016-11-27T10:12:28+0000	1480241548	2016-11-27 11:12:28	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The date for Christmas eve appeared at midnight but no available slots. I kept checking throughout the night and still nothing available  therefore I m extremely tired today. I emailed to complain this morning  only to recieve a reply saying that Tesco are not doing deliveries on Christmas eve. ***This is not what your email states*** Really Tesco  what is going on?!? and now it is even too late to book a delivery slot for the 23rd or even the 22nd of December. The lady who replied to my email  even suggested that i try and select click and collect. I am a pregnant mother with 3 children at home and Tesco is the other side of my town  therefore this is not an option!  We have our shopping delivered weekly from Tecso but this is seriously making me want to shop elsewhere from now on!  I would like a delivery slot allocating to me  given that I ve been given false and misleading information and if it can t be on the 24th  then it needs to be the evening of the 23rd  or another supermarket will be getting my custom.  Thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15178299_10155411399317646_6878402843797017049_n.jpg?oh=0358ba1a3be07f59f4d9e7d05abcc356&oe=592428A6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15178299_10155411399317646_6878402843797017049_n.jpg?oh=e5252f2ce512829f337fa955fb69392b&oe=591C13AB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155411399317646&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-27T10:05:42+0000	1480241142	2016-11-27 11:05:42	0	35	1	0	36	35	6	29	30	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Just got them out for dinner tonight and look at the size difference. The smaller one weighs only 200g whilst the bigger one weighs 360g. The box says 410g so I can t see how you got it so wrong. How is that going to feed 4 people. Get your weights right Tesco. Now need to go and buy another one... 😁😁.

A Korma is normally yellowish in colour and very coconutty. This jar of own brand “Korma” bared just about no resemblance to what any normal person would call a Korma. The easiest way to describe the jar contents is like this. Imagine the mildest curry you can get from the chip shop and then add a pinch of coconut. The colour matched greeny chip shop curry to an art  but it wasn t chip shop curry I wanted. I wanted yellowie  coconutty  slightly creamy Korma.  Who ever you had doing the taste test on this one must have obviously been given the wrong the wrong curry to taste. Thoroughly disappointed and I will not be buying it again! Hopefully the jar of “Buttery Chicken” is as it should be or I ll be back here with more disappointment.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15202588_10154816314552437_8051667341033879761_n.jpg?oh=e4b8797cafa3473dfd06af0c530852f7&oe=59212EE3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/15202588_10154816314552437_8051667341033879761_n.jpg?oh=fddd16b31a77bf60d87682f172c6f3e8&oe=58E3E116	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154816314552437&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-27T07:38:18+0000	1480232298	2016-11-27 08:38:18	1	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

Since I have photos to accompany my complains  I have to make two posts. Firstly  I would like to point out my annoyance at the fact that your Belfast Metro store does not accept contactless payments or PayQwiq despite this sign on every self service till in the store. This evening I went to purchase some items using PayQwiq and if it had not have been for my boyfriend  then I would have been left sad and without my 4 bars of chocolate (yes 4  don t judge me). It was rather frustrating as I like the ease of not having to bring my purse out with me all the time since I can use your app.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15241414_10154143244753716_1028541409396191718_n.jpg?oh=3209721046ecbd39af9597d5c3b008ac&oe=58E07A5D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15241414_10154143244753716_1028541409396191718_n.jpg?oh=71f8aba32fca4c80a24792aea407c571&oe=58DF7C29	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154143244753716&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-27T01:11:45+0000	1480209105	2016-11-27 02:11:45	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Roasted them this evening as I had people coming round and this is what greeted us as we cracked into them. The ones that werent mouldy were too hard to eat (id cooked them properly...im not new to roasting chestnuts...)  and the ones that were soft enough were black with mould. I only bought them yesterday!!  Do I need to take all these mouldy bits all the way back to the shop or can you help me?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15203311_1139175366203842_2580349817364294509_n.jpg?oh=63b5316e7546ab994a633c7033323ba2&oe=5922BC82	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15203311_1139175366203842_2580349817364294509_n.jpg?oh=be5c4e487f73bb5f63c8b2b939ea657e&oe=58DADD97	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1139175366203842&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-26T21:08:51+0000	1480194531	2016-11-26 22:08:51	1	10	2	0	12	9	3	6	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

Ordered my son an iPad mini for xmas in the Black Friday sale at 5:30am on Froday. Only to be told today one of your couriers has delivered it to the wrong store so you have decided to send the item back to the warehouse and send me a refund...without even asking. Quelle Surprise  they are now out of stock and I am unable to buy one. That s one Christmas you are making a whole lot more stressful....completely unnecessarily.

Always does her online weekly shop with Tesco and there s usually something that goes wrong (usually substitutes which I appreciate can t be helped but generally it s stupid packing and 1 plastic bag per item!) but this week really takes the biscuit.   Bakery items in a bag with the washing powder? Mmm tasty... Who doesn t love an Ariel flavoured sandwich?  Not to mention the damaged and mouldy fruit below. Maybe Lidl and Kevin the Carrot could teach you a thing or two about FRESH fruit and veg?   I think we ll be doing our weekly shop elsewhere from now on. Sick of spending thousands of pounds a year when week in week out you just can t get it right.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15232265_1302074959853297_3441912075750041394_n.jpg?oh=1193f0927d630692c2a5ce81fd9d2ab6&oe=58DCE7D7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15232265_1302074959853297_3441912075750041394_n.jpg?oh=9cbdee31f64b28332e77047d73fe0bbe&oe=58DD1BC2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1302074959853297&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-26T20:46:08+0000	1480193168	2016-11-26 21:46:08	5	4	5	0	9	4	3	1	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

The staff know and said they are getting good someone to clear it up and I offered to to stand by it til a member of staff arrives to make sure no one slips over but now I have been stood here for about 25 minutes. I can t leave this in case someone slips over and hurts themselves. Staff need to react faster to spills please.					2016-11-26T17:14:11+0000	1480180451	2016-11-26 18:14:11	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only to find when i cut into the  fresh  loaf of sourdough it was frozen in the middle  which would imply that your bread in the bakery is not fresh.

Couldn t get parked at all. After twenty minutes we left and went to your Batley store instead (not very convenient but we needed to get our shop).  I was appalled at the state of the shelves. More than 30 tins (7 different types) were displayed in disarray  dented  damaged and some leaking.  Disgraceful! Shop management should be ashamed! We couldn t buy everything we wanted due to shelves being empty or items too damaged.  Not good. Next time we can t park in Brighouse we will shop at Sainsbury s across the road instead.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15179105_10154871681101320_99180874223173206_n.jpg?oh=77533fcbde9ec485bf4518a03fd94238&oe=58D77A54	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15179105_10154871681101320_99180874223173206_n.jpg?oh=2c98abba8479729c05a6faa50eceb5e1&oe=58EDE0AB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154871681101320&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-26T15:24:08+0000	1480173848	2016-11-26 16:24:08	0	4	0	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But I m disappointed to tell you I ve now wasted 40 mins  and cut several of my fingers  attempting to remove the plastic plug from the bottle of one of your White Grace reed diffusers. The instructions state to merely  remove the plastic plug from bottle   but it appears the bung has been pushed into the bottle tighter than a sealed vault. Coupled with this  the fact that attempting to prise the bung from the bottle starts to release small amounts of the oil and causes the whole thing to become more slippery than the frost-covered roads this morning  I feel like I m attempting the type of challenge one sees on a TV game show - designed for the contestant to never win. I ve tried a knife - hence the cut fingers  keys  a metal nail file & my bare hands. I still cannot remove the plug from the bottle to enjoy the wonderful fragrance (though I do now have nice-smelling keys). I m relatively strong and deadlifting 97kg at the gym this morning to be frank  took nowhere near as much effort & was not as exhausting as attempting to open this bottle. Can you possibly please offer some advice?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15267510_10157829617975596_6474899726375912680_n.jpg?oh=5452a065b47fbbe8c8a667275dfba30e&oe=59242AC3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15267510_10157829617975596_6474899726375912680_n.jpg?oh=16a08d6d312b931453d99169f45558b4&oe=5920CCCE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157829617975596&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-26T14:56:23+0000	1480172183	2016-11-26 15:56:23	31	28	56	1	85	27	11	16	48	0	30	3	1	21	0	0	0

I had left my paid for shopping on the self service checkout whilst shopping with my two and four year old sons. I realised what I had done when I got home and quickly called my Mum who was still in town. She went into the store and explained to a young lady (named Georgia I think) what I had done  who went off to find my purchase on the till system  printed off my receipt and gave my Mum all my shopping.  I am a huge Tesco fan! I have been a Delivery Saver customers for over 4 years. Your customer service is fantastic.

Just had my weekly delivery and as I went into the hall to open the door I looked and the cat had a mouse!!! So I bolted out the door straight into the arms of a lovely delivery driver! He then proceeded to catch the mouse and shoo it out of the door by pulling out the hall table and beating the ground with a dustpan!!! My hero! I thanked him so much and as he left he said   No problem love  every little helps!  What a guy 😆					2016-11-26T14:31:33+0000	1480170693	2016-11-26 15:31:33	6	1	7	0	8	1	1	0	0	0	6	0	0	1	0	0	0

Up until the last few weeks on visiting your stores  petrol stations and using Tesco direct I have usually been quite happy with the experience. This has changed in the last few weeks while trying to get a Hatchimals. While I understand that there is a high demand for this toy I would like you to tell me how it s fair that even when you get a delivery of them they are not even making it to your shelves for the customer to buy!! On 3 separate occasions in 3 different stores I have being told that you are expecting a delivery but basically they have been taken by delivery drivers or staff before they even make it onto the shop floor. This included 2 late night trips into your stores. Now I know staff are entitled to some perks but surely it s unfair for this to keep happening so that customers don t even have a chance to buy this toy. Come Christmas morning my daughter and niece are going to be very disappointed that Santa couldn t deliver them this toy due to the probable greed of some of your staff. Fair enough if they are buying them for their children but I hope they are only allowed to buy 1 which seems to be the policy of a lot of stores.					2016-11-26T14:20:20+0000	1480170020	2016-11-26 15:20:20	6	10	6	1	17	10	9	1	9	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

It has just been renewed and looks very nice  and the bread is of a very high standard as opposed to the other Tesco in the area.  Unfortunately you have decided to display the fresh bread unwrapped straight on the shelf.  Saw several people coughing and sneezing on it  and one person after having quite a hacking cough into his hands  pick a bloomer up  then put it back.  Surely hygiene has to be in question.  It s not like you can wash bread as you do fruit and veg  and it is the height of the cold and flu season.  I personally won t be buying fresh bread from your store until it is wrapped again  Andy I know a few Didsbury locals who won t be either.  This is not a dig at your staff  who as always do an exemplary job.					2016-11-26T14:08:08+0000	1480169288	2016-11-26 15:08:08	4	8	4	0	12	8	5	3	5	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

So yet again out of pocket and having to shop at different store. Waited a week from Tesco s to tell me sorry the item is out of stock when clearly it wasn t when I went through checkout with no problems. Had customer services on the phone other day stating that the shopkins were going to be season 3 instead of season 4. Why not inform me then so I could of cancelled the full order get my money and my clubcard vouchers back. Now I have to go to the store wasting more money to end up waiting 3-5 days for MY money back.					2016-11-26T11:08:51+0000	1480158531	2016-11-26 12:08:51	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As it was obstructing the bread I required  I asked a member of staff to remove the trolley enabling me to reach it. If you/I/ don t ask you/I/ don t get. Simple. Staff are there to help their customers when required. They all do an excellent job.  .					2016-11-26T10:27:41+0000	1480156061	2016-11-26 11:27:41	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This clearly was not going to phase  Jo  Jo  Lindsey and Dave in Eastbourne who secured the needed gift cards from all corners of the store as well as Eastbourne. This crack service team also managed to keep serving customers whilst processing the gift cards.

You put great emphasis on looking after your customers but I don t see any behaviour that supports it from yourself.   1. I bought a shopping online nearly 2 weeks ago and it was supposed to be delivered. The delivery man rang and I literally missed his call by less than 20 seconds. I tried to call back straight away and there was no answer  I tried calling several times and got not response.  I contacted you by phone and the fella told me that he doesn t need to pick up the phone!  I have a problem with that  firstly your staff are making all the effort to go around the warehouse/ store to pick up the ingredients. Then putting them into a basket for the driver  the drivers drives all the way to us and then he is too lazy to make an effort and is not obliged to pick up the phone. He ll drive all the way back and the stuff is put back  I don t know what you are considering saving money. But if you do that with every customer  it wouldn t surprise me if your going to losse money because of the laziness of your staff. (Btw everytime I go into a tesco there is at least one problem that I can point out to you)  Anyway  I m also being told that I will be refunded the full amount. That was 10 days ago and that hasn t happened yet. Maybe posting this on fb will get you to reply!?!

Placed online order  paid  had confirmation email to then be emailed 20 minutes later saying... Sorry we don t have any stock! But the best bit is I used some of my hard saved club card vouchers. Beware people  once they have been registered on an order they have been used. Tesco do put your points  back on your clubcard but not as money vouchers! This means you will have to wait to get them converted in the new year. So after a long and very disagreeable conversation with your customer services I now have to wait up to ten days to get the vouchers resent to me so I can use them again. So not only did I lose my confirmed order but also my clubcard vouchers which I had to phone and chase to get back. Sort yourselves out Tesco. Not impressed.					2016-11-26T09:24:51+0000	1480152291	2016-11-26 10:24:51	2	5	2	0	7	5	3	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m thinking we could use this idea for even more - for our hardworking older generation  many of which have nobody and nothing at all. Year after year I have seen respectable people who have worked all their lives  yet don t have any family or money and are sat in the cold dark lounge on their own. Anything such as sachets of hot chocolate/Horlicks  marmalade  jam  biscuits  slippers  socks  warm pyjamas  scarves  tissues  handkerchiefs  toiletries... it would all help. I am looking to put together some packages which will be handed out by our local branch of Contact The Elderly to vulnerable elderly people at their Christmas get togethers.  Anybody who is interested in getting involved don t hesitate to give me a message  it would be really appreciated. ❤️️🎄👴🏼👵🏻					2016-11-26T08:39:07+0000	1480149547	2016-11-26 09:39:07	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did them a favour saying the pork is off and the lady that served me had so much attitude and hate ... she made me feel like I was lying about the pork being off ( she did not smell or touch the pork I returned!)  Didn t even say sorry and I had to ask for the refund!  Huh Tesco says they value this and that well they don t value their customers that s for sure!!

This was an idea we came up with after I had been let down for some prior plans the same day  so I was looking forward to it.   Unfortunately. You apparently have to have I.D for Non alcoholic items too!! I had mine in my purse but my friend didn t  so we were refused. The lady seemed confused and called over another member of staff over too ask if we really needed I.D for non alcoholic items. She was very blunt even after I explained it s for my birthday and I m pregnant etc etc. (By the way I m quite obviously pregnant as I m 23 weeks with a big bump)   The lady on the till then said do you want the rest of your stuff  the bar kit (with plastic cocktail glasses and straws etc) and some juices (orange juice etc) we took a minute to decide as I was wondering if it was worth it without the grenadine (as that s what gives it a cocktail feel) we decided to purchase the rest of our items  the lady then proceeded to slam our receipt on top of our shopping quite rudely.   I m honestly very angry about all this  I think it s ridiculous that we should need our I.D for non alcoholic drinks. I d like to know why firstly... I ve never seen a law anywhere that says I.D is required for NON alcoholic drinks (beer wine champagne).   Thanks for ruining my only plans I had left for my birthday  and the very rude service we received for absolutely no reason at all. 👌🏼					2016-11-25T21:33:07+0000	1480109587	2016-11-25 22:33:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a delivery today at 11.15ish  and I rejected the 6 bottles of Plaza Pink Spumante substituted for the Sweet Asti Spumante I ordered. I checked my card today and find I ve been charged the 31.50 for the drink. I m told the driver may not have returned yet for this correction to be made  but that s already almost 8 hours ago  and he told us he d already been out delivering for a while. Also  I m told I will have to wait 3-5 days for the money to be returned  whereas last week when I had a problem with something delivered with a day left on it  my refund was instant. It s a lot of money to have to wait around to be returned  especially this time of year when money is tight. Could you confirm that this the true facts as I m obviously concerned that somehow this credit has gone missing.					2016-11-25T18:53:12+0000	1480099992	2016-11-25 19:53:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m going to have a moan at you on here as I ve moaned at you on Twitter and nobody has listened over there (I m hoping that whoever looks after your Facebook page is better than the folk running your Twitter). Anyway  here goes... like a lot of folk I m quite partial to a nice bottle/can of craft ale and regularly visit your Thirsk store to replenish my stocks. Annoyingly  whoever decides where the aforementioned ale resides on your shelves clearly doesn t know what they re doing as it s spread over no less than three different areas in the aisle (some with the lager  some with the beer and (most bizarrely) some with the alcopops. This makes keeping track of what you have in stock a bit of a challenge and could mean that folk are missing out on the fine examples brewing that you have in stock (particular kudos for the Brooklyn East IPA). Is there any chance you could rustle up a dedicated craft ale section on your shelves - it can t be too tricky as other (not to be named) competition seem to be able to manage. It would make my life a lot easier and would probably mean you d sell more beer too. Cheers (literally and metaphorically) 🍻					2016-11-25T17:40:44+0000	1480095644	2016-11-25 18:40:44	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today an email has been sent to say Tesco got it wrong and the order will not be dispatched!! I am absolutely disgusted by this customer service from Tesco! What on earth is that about?!? Yes we are all aware of the trouble in getting your hands on this elusive toy  but to do this is just the worst! Now we are all back on the search for the 1 toy everyone wants.

One manger who I will refer to as  Chris  picked it up and asked the other store manager who I believe is  steve   have you seen this new cheese? It s expensive  I can tell you now that won t sell in Brownhills  ...now that ladies and gentlemen is class discrimination at its finest (excuse the pun) surely as managers they are given training in how not to discriminate?? I will say  while Steve didn t pull chris up on his discriminative manor  he didn t agree with him either he just said  you never know  . My point to this post is  even if the cheese won t sell to us Brownhills folk at least give us the courtesy of keeping your opinion private! I do believe if it wasn t for us Brownhills people shopping at the store you wouldn t have your job there!!!

I seen a couple of people while I was in the store looking for TVs to buy being told there was none left.

They have told me they are unable to locate my parcel and they have no record of it. The delivery card that was left you will see attached. Would it be possible for you to try to find out what has happened to my parcel from yourselves as I have been told I am unable to. I would like to add that I ended up having this item home delivered as it was lost in transit between stores. So this is getting a little irritating now. 😡	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15178261_10208960369430041_6305723003350732816_n.jpg?oh=a46c73bac8b4d6f4a1d75f4c97a3f4fb&oe=58E36ACD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15178261_10208960369430041_6305723003350732816_n.jpg?oh=6580d96732def8388a8196173c397771&oe=591C62C0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208960369430041&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-25T11:47:17+0000	1480074437	2016-11-25 12:47:17	0	11	1	0	12	10	2	8	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I went to tesco this morning to get my fresh ham at the Lincoln store. It was for my lunch and while eating it I realized it had some strange tomato looking sauce on it. This is obviously from being used by dirty utensils. I m really not happy as I love ham and often get it from your tesco store. I payed 2.92 for it and I m really upset I can t eat it. I don t want to go there anymore for my ham because it s put me off. I m very dissapointed tesco. Also the photo doesn t show the full extent of the sauce.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15135888_10154979865293974_7833326891583438582_n.jpg?oh=ee87b1ae1190baf0aedeb4346ae111c6&oe=58E67203	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15135888_10154979865293974_7833326891583438582_n.jpg?oh=477a4b0801237aca09284e41781baf32&oe=59230F0E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154979865293974&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-25T11:01:38+0000	1480071698	2016-11-25 12:01:38	16	3	18	0	21	3	3	0	0	0	16	0	0	0	2	0	0

I emailed customer service but got no response.....imagine doing a weekly shop with a 1 and 2 year old with only a one seater trolley....its a nightmare! I asked someone in the carpark if they had any (Reading tesco extra) and was told  just go look for one ...nice......I asked in store and was told they only have a handful and lazy people without pound coins used them and that s why there weren t any and its always a problem.....All of Morrisons trolleys are 2 seater and ASDA always have loads available (probably because theirs are free)...surely I am not the only person who has brought this to your attention????? I dont want to have to shop elsewhere as I really like Tesco but its becoming an ordeal to do the weekly shop :-(					2016-11-25T10:40:24+0000	1480070424	2016-11-25 11:40:24	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know  who would have thought that a 24 hour superstore would be closed?!?! My time is very precious and I do not appreciate having to wait for nearly an hour for the 24 hour shop to open. It is my birthday and as a treat to myself I wanted to get my food shopping done before getting the children up  doing the school runs and going to work. You have foiled my plan by closing a 24 hour functioning store. Like I said to the lovely store assistant (through the massive metal shutters)  I don t care if it s Black Friday or green Tuesday  this is not on. I have to go to some serious lengths to shop on my own and I thought I was in for a right treat. It s not on Tesco. I am very disappointed in you.					2016-11-25T04:38:49+0000	1480048729	2016-11-25 05:38:49	10	45	14	1	60	43	15	28	38	0	10	1	0	3	0	0	0

Now this may make perfect sense to you  however I personally think that the needs of your customers should come first and as black Friday is an American tradition I as a UK citizen do not expect to find a 24hr store closed due to such silly traditions!

I ve tried this at two different stores  however same outcome. Waiting around (40 minutes the first time) no one bothering to come and serve. Second time I patiently waited at customer services to eventually be told to get in the cigarette/magazine queue. Then when I finally got to the till  to then be told I should have gone to customer services! Unhelpful staff. I m disabled and cannot stand for long periods. Shame on you Tesco! Oh and by the way the box that the doll was in was damaged  so no good for a Christmas gift.					2016-11-25T01:50:46+0000	1480038646	2016-11-25 02:50:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Really? How about some notice? Everyone here is literally waiting to buy milk and sugar etc. Why not announce your intention rather than closing shop? 24 hours means 24 hours.

For the last 2 Christmases we have had the chance to meet the real man himself with our twins and every year he s back. And through out the year he works in disguise in the store without his beard and suit. And in may starts growing it back in time for Christmas.   He is a lovely guy and super helpful and every year happy to have a photo with our girls so they can see over the years that santander really is real and working in tesco in hucknall Nottingham. This guy needs a big pat on the back for his excellent service throughout the year and an extra one for going the extra mile for all the kids at Christmas. Looking forward to seeing him again soon and getting our yearly photo to add to the album well done Chris your a star xxxx	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15220200_1156109254485811_2673898811176849237_n.jpg?oh=c203dd4ad0ca6f8b924ee791dbc4b65c&oe=58E3F32B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15220200_1156109254485811_2673898811176849237_n.jpg?oh=77815dce50d4e8bad6aee8d0737b16da&oe=58E1293E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1156109254485811&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-24T22:45:50+0000	1480027550	2016-11-24 23:45:50	6	6	7	0	13	5	2	3	2	0	6	1	0	0	0	0	0

As we got to the checkout  his temperature spiked  his face turned completely white and his lips blue and he began to vomit. He then slowly became rather unresponsive and was laying on me on the shop floor. To say I was terrified was an understatement.  I want to say a massive thank you to your staff who were absolutely amazing. First aiders were immediately alerted  an ambulance called and reassurance given all so quickly. We were taken to a private room to give us some space and were offered and given literally anything and everything. Your care  kindness and generosity is something I cannot thank you enough for. You were all amazing and deserve recognition for going above and beyond.  I only caught the names of three people  Nick  Nicky and Sharon but please pass on my thanks to everyone who assisted us. Joey appears to have had a febrile convulsion due to his high temperature and has low blood sugar. He is still very poorly but is now tucked up fast asleep. He very much loves his new Bob the Builder toy!  Thank you also to Laura Spzurko  the paramedic. You were amazing with Joey  so caring and patient.  Thank you all again so much 💖					2016-11-24T21:57:59+0000	1480024679	2016-11-24 22:57:59	829	67	918	58	1043	65	50	15	95	0	823	88	1	0	0	0	0

Hundreds of packs and individual cards on display. How many Religious ones? 1. Thats right - Christmas  the celebration that takes the name of the person after whom the holiday is so named and only 1 religious card. Shame on you tesco. I returned my items to the shelf and left. Youve missed the point entirely just so you can stack a few more santa claus and idiotic joke cards on the shelves.

My partner has just been on a special trip to your Hattersley branch in search of a Chrome cast  after looking on your website to check if they had stock. It said there was stock there but on arrival he was told there were none but perhaps they were being delivered the next day which is why they were showing as in stock. There is no point I providing a stock checker on your website if the information is incorrect which then leads to a wasted journey. Perhaps your Hattersley branch is in need of a stock take to prevent this happening again.					2016-11-24T20:32:38+0000	1480019558	2016-11-24 21:32:38	2	11	2	0	13	11	2	9	7	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was not just one thing but a number of things to the point that it made me so mad and disappointed. I felt very let down from Tesco and their staff!  I decided I was paying at a till as I still love the face to face of customer service I normally get at Tescos! I waited for ages while the 2 sales assistants put through and bagged. 1 just had a terrible attitude didn t want to be there at all and when I finally go there he asked did I have a bag... I explained while stopping my son from doing his own merchandising and I popped my bag down told my son to stop and the sales guy tutted and just stood there not engaging at all with myself but finishing scanning was chatting to the other sale assistant  I passed my club card and he was angry to deal with it and muted under his breath the total and I paired by card he put the receipt on my bag and then went off before I even got my card out of the reader! I enjoy shopping in your stores but I will not be doing so for a while as I am totally disgusted with his attitude and shocking lack of customer service  if he is a long standing member of staff he needs updating on his understanding on customer service as today s events show he has no understanding and if he is new your standards for choosing staff is seriously low to the point if I do come back to shop at that store and there are more sales assistants like that I would be totally disappointed and never shop with you again I do not wish that to be an option I expected better from you and your sales assistants after all they are the face of Tesco s					2016-11-24T19:45:55+0000	1480016755	2016-11-24 20:45:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco was the only store who s chicken caesar wraps didnt contain any pork products. They were my favourite wraps and I brought one almost every day for my lunch for years and they were always very popular. If you didnt get to the shop early enough  they would be gone. But I popped into the tesco petrol station yesterday to get a wrap  and they have changed and now have bacon. Not only that  every wrap and sandwich in there contained bacon or ham  except the chicken mayo  which has way too much mayo and is horrible. I mentioned to the lady stacking the shelves and she said I was the second person that morning to say the same thing. Please can you take the bacon back out of the chicken caesar wraps! Why change a popular product that was perfect the way it was?					2016-11-24T19:44:47+0000	1480016687	2016-11-24 20:44:47	1	8	1	0	9	8	3	5	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It had the correct address but the wrong name.  Inside the box was a PS4!!! I can t believe this was just left unsigned for... Anyone could have picked it up and taken it! Or  if I wasn t terrible with computer games and scared of the karma  I might have kept it!! I would never do that but doesn t seem like a very secure delivery service to me.

I took the snowball from his hands and smelt it and it stunk of chemicals and he said it tasted disgusting  it was like they were covered in bleach. I think you should take these off your shelves asap 😕 because whatever is in them smells and tastes really harmful.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15107452_1373472305999058_6256520369223179635_n.jpg?oh=e3bc78723dcbf4e6c44ca5f294c49502&oe=5920ED2C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15107452_1373472305999058_6256520369223179635_n.jpg?oh=1f41e75fe0aa6d41b5e35c4a3dceaf65&oe=58E4CE39	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1373472305999058&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-24T19:36:52+0000	1480016212	2016-11-24 20:36:52	1	4	1	0	5	3	2	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was told this was a 12 week trial. Tesco please do the decent thing and cancel this trial now.					2016-11-24T19:28:54+0000	1480015734	2016-11-24 20:28:54	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m normally okay with substitutions but not on this occasion  1) the Tesco Pineapple Slices in Juice are shown as available on your website & 2) if I order slices in juice  that s what I want & I would expect you to provide a branded option instead.

I brought my other children selection boxes thinking I could grab this for my daughter so she wouldn t feel left out .  I m totally amazed that 2 of your shops let alone all of the little tescos shops you have in Braintree that not one of them have stocked these and won t be stocking them !!

Why  according to either your or your supplier s labelling  can t my daughter have this?  We work really hard to make sure our daughters know there are no such things as boys toys and girls toys  and boys clothes and girls clothes - there are just toys and clothes  and they can play with and wear the things they like. So it frustrates me no end that  even on this small level  everyday sexism is prevalent across the child-focused aisles  and unravels what we re trying to do.  My daughters are already growing up in a world where they ll have to fight tooth and nail to be seen on an even footing in so many aspects of life. We re doing what we can as parents to arm them to fight against it - but please don t keep making it even harder for them by continuing this sort of gender division.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15170845_10154287679362779_5237040355136641885_n.jpg?oh=9fd77163a76c2e95abe511e99add2a1b&oe=58E8C6B3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15170845_10154287679362779_5237040355136641885_n.jpg?oh=023debc33e7c7208215675affb7f1c2b&oe=58E3FBBE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154287679362779&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-24T18:04:42+0000	1480010682	2016-11-24 19:04:42	13	10	14	0	24	10	5	5	20	0	13	1	0	0	0	0	0

Bought a Tesco chicken joint in your Newry store last night 23rd Nov with an expiry date of 25th November. I went to cook it for tonight s dinner and the chicken smells rancid. It s clearly contaminated. I am very cross because in order to take this back I would have to take my kids back out into the cold which I am not prepared to do and secondly I have nothing else to cook with my dinner.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15203226_10154089697090794_3832703706223926918_n.jpg?oh=627309796fec5097a99a18dc14c73868&oe=58D90E81	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15203226_10154089697090794_3832703706223926918_n.jpg?oh=938fa6d0e3bd93fc81b46aa4f82234fb&oe=591A8E8C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154089697090794&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-24T17:47:43+0000	1480009663	2016-11-24 18:47:43	2	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	2	0

I had left the shop before thinking to ask for her name but she was on the click and collect desk at around 11.30 this morning. I was struggling with the amount of bags i had from Xmas shopping and I had my little boy in his pram. When she heard I was getting the bus with more things than I could carry she could not have done more to help me. She took my direct order out of all its packaging and helped me rearrange the bags so I could manage better. People take the time to make complaints but I thought this lovely girl deserved a thank you for being so kind and being far more helpful than she needed to be. It was very much appreciated. Thank you so much  it made my journey home much easier. X					2016-11-24T14:27:42+0000	1479997662	2016-11-24 15:27:42	14	3	14	0	17	3	1	2	2	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

The expiry date is for tomorrow 25th November but I have just taken it out of the bag and it smells rather pungent. I haven t even opened it. I did buy ine last week and found the seel didnt actually aeel it properly and wondering if this has caused the problem. I didn t pick up my receipt and don t have the time today to drive back up to exchange it for something else. Can I return it tomorrow?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15178162_10158024455660727_752157678969854774_n.jpg?oh=9a56828db37ad3ed961a78609add028e&oe=58DB30FF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15178162_10158024455660727_752157678969854774_n.jpg?oh=f6c1c03bff8d70b3236dc4b91cb0f747&oe=592462EA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158024455660727&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-24T14:24:39+0000	1479997479	2016-11-24 15:24:39	2	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed on order on-line for the 3 for 2 offer and purchased 3 toys for my son on Saturday 19th November. I received an email to say all 3 items had been dispatched the next day  Sunday 20th. On Monday the 21st I then had a text to say 2 of the items were ready to collect  I thought I would wait for the 3rd to arrive and collect them all together.  By this morning I was getting a little concerned as I hadn t heard anything on the 3rd item so I called Tesco Direct  I was told that my item had definitely been dispatched and was just waiting to be collected from the warehouse. She than also said she was putting me on a stock alert as the item was out of stock in case my item didn t arrive. This set alarm bells ringing as if my item had definitely been dispatched why would it not arrive.  I went to my local store this afternoon to collect the 2 items that were waiting and discussed my concerns with the sales assistant who also seemed confused as if my item had been dispatched as stated on email and by the call centre staff  then it should have arrived. The sales assistant again called Tesco Direct to discuss my order. After a lengthy wait and being on hold it was confirmed my item was never dispatched as it is out of stock.  The item that is out of stock is the 1 present my son wants this year  other places had great deals on this item that weekend but as I was looking at other items with you it made great sense to benefit from the 3 for 2 offer.  The options I have been given is either stay on stock alert and hope it comes into stock or receive a refund for 1/2 the price of them item I haven t received which would then leave me out of pocket and have paid more than the other 2 items cost.   Item 1 cost £71.24 (out of stock) Item 2 cost £36.05 Item 3 cost £28.49  I paid £107.29 which is the total of item 1 and 2 and the 3rd was free.   I have been offered which I think is disgusting that if the item 1 does not come back on stock I will get a refund of 1/2 the value which works out at £35.62.  So not only through no fault of my own am I losing out on the 3 for 2 deal but I am also paying more than what the other 2 items were worth.  The total cost of item 2 and 3 is £64.54 if you take that from the £107.29 I paid it leaves £42.70. So why am I only getting a refund of £35.62. Meaning I ve paid £7.08 more than the 2 items I have received cost on the first place.  My money should not have been taken if the item was not available to be sold and now there s a good chance my son won t get the 1 thing he has asked for because it is out of stock everywhere.					2016-11-24T14:11:48+0000	1479996708	2016-11-24 15:11:48	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered an experience day last week for my dad for xmas (dont worry hes not on fb so wont see this) it was £65  looked today and it was £47 as you can imagine i thought to myself *typical* so i phoned up direct customer services and told them of the price reduction! The guy was lovely and friendly (didnt get his name) and because the price reduction is within 28 days of my purchase I get the difference refunded!! Woo woo! Happy Amy!  Another online shop has something i ordered yesterday cheaper today and they said NO to the difference refund so i have to post it back and reorder! 😞  THANK YOU TESCO DIRECT ☺					2016-11-24T14:04:48+0000	1479996288	2016-11-24 15:04:48	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Then it turns out the car is worth less and can be insured as its worth less than my exsess  this is not a chines plastic thing that s been imported or the uk market but a fine motor  witch will never be made like this again  so I ask how much.... They happy Sam said can t tell you?  So I say how can you give a valuation if you don t know it  well after some time come back £90 it s worth  So let s see mk1 Mondeo rare as hens teeth so lets pic a base model like an lx 1800cc there fetching anywhere bitween £300 to £600 ?!?!?!?!

This is normally older people who can t be bothered to walk from wherever they park.  Today an older lady justified her parking in a parent and child bay by the fact that her husband has had a heart attack. Very sad indeed. But then she went on to say (when we suggested parking in the disabled bay)  that she couldn t park there cause she didn t have a disabled badge. Nevermind that... But the husband sat in the car waiting for her to do the shop. So did it really matter where the car was parked???  For me it isn t about the distance but the space around your car to be able to take your baby out of the car without being restricted by other cars parked next to you. Such a shame there is no solution to stopping people with no children from parking in the parent and child bays  :( Unless there is???					2016-11-24T12:12:49+0000	1479989569	2016-11-24 13:12:49	6	3	6	0	9	3	3	0	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

However that does not change the fact that Argos is by far the better company to shop with when they give you £10.00 for every £100.00 that you spend instantly. I would also like to tell people that the Dyson Hand Held Vacuum (correct spelling this time) is just fantastic I have not seen my wife smile so much for a long time.					2016-11-24T12:11:52+0000	1479989512	2016-11-24 13:11:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought one for my daughter  who used it very few times when the charging port became damaged. After speaking to technical support who said there is nothing they can do   I contacted the manufacturer to try and purchase a new port to have fitted by an independent repairer.  To my surprise I was told these tablets can not be repaired!  So a £90 tablet used very little and still under warranty now has to be thrown in the bin!!!  So please take this into account when buying for children   and maybe look at spending slightly more with a better company so these easily damaged parts  which normally cost very little won t end up costing you a new tablet 😡					2016-11-24T11:41:42+0000	1479987702	2016-11-24 12:41:42	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why are you charging £3 for 3 walnut whips? Your slogan  every little helps  seems to be relating to tesco again rather than the customers. A 3 pack of walnut whips are £1 in so many big stores on a daily basis at present!  This is exactly why I I find myself unable to do all my shopping at tesco because you overcharge for so many items. I look forward to your response as I truely cannot see how this massive price difference can be justified.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15170924_10211313979232419_4276508796065014373_n.jpg?oh=38f87551dc4f1ba75863d145b20a8e2b&oe=58E813D0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15170924_10211313979232419_4276508796065014373_n.jpg?oh=fad39d0dbccf03b3e076db107cdb0363&oe=58E683DD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211313979232419&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-24T10:02:11+0000	1479981731	2016-11-24 11:02:11	0	7	0	0	7	7	5	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So  one of my very close friends is having her birthday in January and I recently spotted that the TWIX Cheese cake which is currently available in your UK stores aren t available anywhere in India. I would have gladly placed an order online but as we are aware you wont deliver it to India. So  I was wondering if I am willing to pay the extra shipping along with the product cost  is there a way we can get the TWIX cheese cake to India.  P.S. I am planning of it to be a surprise. :)					2016-11-24T08:51:22+0000	1479977482	2016-11-24 09:51:22	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the last 3 weeks I have made around 20 visits to this store in a desperate attempt to purchase a Hatchimals Toy for a Christmas gift  each time I was repeatedly told to return on the next delivery day and try again. Whilst I understand that this is a very popular toy this Christmas I certainly did not expect to hear what I did at 1am this morning!  I was told to return to store at 10pm (expected delivery time) by your main customer service call centre  upon this visit I was then told that the delivery was not expected for another couple of hours and if I really wanted to I could return at 1am thus giving the staff enough time to unload their delivery etc. When I returned at 1am I was quite rudely told that staff were unable to sell the item as they had a very long list of customers phone numbers to offer them to first! I was never informed of this procedure by any member of staff in this store over the 3 week period nor by your customer service team and find it rather disgusting that whilst every other store is providing them on a first come first served basis  this store seems to be making its own rules up!  Please could you clarify what company policy is on this issue??					2016-11-24T01:36:11+0000	1479951371	2016-11-24 02:36:11	0	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

It s really unfair as it s difficult enough to source allergy free products; especially at Christmas.   There isn t much choice for those who can t eat without having to check for allergens so surely you d make it at a more reasonable cost. I ve had family members everywhere trying to source dairy free treats and food for my little boys first proper Christmas  and for a few items including a staple every child wants (advent calendar  chocolates  mince pies) it s almost costing as much as it is to feed our whole family on Christmas day.   Is there any way you could look into making some special deals or adding more choices to your stores. The free from range is really good and I m greatful stores are being open minded about allergies. It s just a shame about the pricing and lack of stock.   Many thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15203224_961391244004299_6250879245269067470_n.jpg?oh=ed08a963d6d1cdd52622fd46aed59521&oe=58DB367E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15203224_961391244004299_6250879245269067470_n.jpg?oh=fb32c65695d28b79edf45b591e586922&oe=58EDBF81	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=961391244004299&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-23T23:10:13+0000	1479942613	2016-11-24 00:10:13	9	7	9	0	16	6	1	5	4	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

Prior to entering your store  I was mugged of £250 at the cash point on your premises  for the use of your customers.   Upon being mugged  I ran inside and informed the security guard  who came outside  looked in the direction that the mugger ran and told me to call the police  without offering any support and to call them on my behalf or waiting with me whilst I called them. The security guard told me that he was new  and that he didn t know what to do  so was going to speak to the manager.   I called the police  with the support of a kind member of public  and they were there in good time  took DNA swabs  a full statement and were hopeful to obtain an outcome from either the DNA swabs from my hands or from your CCTV overlooking the cashpoint.   Considering I am a petite  22 year old young woman who was alone  I would have thought that a member of management or staff may have come out to ensure that I was okay  considering I was on your premises  using a service that you provide  with the intentions of purchasing products from this store. However  not one member of staff  asked if I was okay  offered me a drink or waited with me until the police arrived. Instead  I was left with strangers  all be it  they were luckily very kind members of the general public.   Following police investigation  today I have been informed by the police that the CCTV camera that I was relying on to provide some evidence  and show the crime being committed  does not record. The police have also informed me that management at this store said the CCTV cameras inside the building are the only ones that work  because they are for customer safety  implying that I was not a customer.   I am eager to know  why I was not a customer on that evening? I was using a service provided by Tesco at most  if not all of your stores  with every intention of using the store after I had withdrawn my money. As a local person  I would normally use your store on a regular basis  at least 3 times per week. But I am not a customer?  Since this event  I have only been to your store if accompanied  with the exception of day light hours. I did however  have to nip in to this store this evening  and on my way back to my car  which I parked close to the building  I became overwhelmed with panic and ended up running to my car and locking the doors.   I am aware that it is unlikely that the person who will find and respond to this message probably doesn t work in the stores  however I would like to know what is going to be done by Tesco  moving forward in order to protect myself and other customers (or non customers as Sunbury management believes) when using the store  or the services provided on the premises.   I look forward to your response.   Kind Regards  Megan Bardini					2016-11-23T21:48:05+0000	1479937685	2016-11-23 22:48:05	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited the transit way store and asked to use a electric shopping cart as I m having a Ms relapse and haven t been able to walk  been dragging myself about.... the girl gave my partner a key and off he goes to get the scooter for me.. after a few minutes he came back and said it s the wrong key so went back up to the counter to ask the correct key. The girl said that s the only key hang on I ll speak to my colleague  she spoke to her colleague and her colleague said I ve just given the key to someone else what do you expect me to do about it!!!!! Well as you can imagine after being spoken to like that we left the store and went elsewhere.. put a complaint in with customer services team and all I get is another customer left the store with the key sorry. The keys have those security tags on that set off the bleepers so why weren t they stopped? I ve had a email back siding with the staff which I knew the were going to do and a half hearted sorry  the manner in which she spoke left me upset and feeling like being disabled was my own fault and a hinderence to others. Well I m sorry I didn t choose to be disabled but I do have a choice where to shop and it certainly won t be with tesco!!!!!! The 2nd member of staff certainly needs to go on a course on how to speak to the public cos saying what do you expect me to do about it was not the right manor in which do deal with it!					2016-11-23T21:43:21+0000	1479937401	2016-11-23 22:43:21	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We normally online shop with you  but  for our last one we tried Sainsbury s. They were similar on price  however  the number of bags used in their bagless delivery shocked us and we returned loyally to you. So imagine my sadness when this was tonight s bagless shop from you.  Each of those 7 green carriers  without exception  ONLY contained pre-packed vegetables or fruit. They are utterly superfluous. This is despite us asking for a bagless delivery and adding extra notes about not bagging items.  I know you don t charge for these (which is strange) when ordering online  but for us this has nothing to do with cost and I also realise that they are recycled and recyclable. Yet  they are also utterly redundant. It is a significant enough issue for us to change brands as evidenced above.  Please do better  it really matters to some of us.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15095455_10154889344091019_8490947613078819403_n.jpg?oh=fde8459cc00a0eb701a0a629cc017e97&oe=5924758A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15095455_10154889344091019_8490947613078819403_n.jpg?oh=538ca598fdfccd3df13163c354e7f251&oe=591F50FE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154889344091019&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-23T21:36:27+0000	1479936987	2016-11-23 22:36:27	1	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	3	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0

However  i was told that they had some but they were locked in a separate storage area ready for your Black Friday sale. Deliberately witholding stock for a future date is absolutely ridiculous. Inconvieniencing your customers by making them waste petrol driving around trying to find the items that you DO HAVE  but are not selling until Friday is just plain rude. This disabled man is now without any form of visual stimulation because you hide your stock for a pathetic sale. Sort it out tescos.

Half of my delivery was delivered yesterday dinner time and i asked the driver to leave it outside as the kids were about. Tonight at the same time the second delivery was delivered and again i asked him to leave it outside so my suspicious 8year old didn t catch on. Keeping the magic going with him is already tricky without bringing in parcels. In my second delivery i was expecting a small scooter and Nerrf bow and arrow. This is what i received. I have not ever ordered these items from tesco or ever had them in my basket.

You were one of the best at Free From selection but you have failed me!! I fear starvation may set in  as when I visited your Southampton Bursledon store (which I think is your biggest supermarket in Southampton) I was greeted with this poor attempt at feeding the minority! What is going on? Are you trying to eradicate the intestinally weak from the human race? I  being a responsible adult  need like everyone else  my daily intake of fattening but tasty calorie rich convenience food of Burgers  Battered Onion Rings  Chicken Nuggets  Margarita Pizza etc!  I left your store feeling dejected  downcast  downhearted  despondent  disconsolate  dispirited  crestfallen  cast down  depressed  disappointed  disheartened  discouraged  demoralized  crushed  desolate  heartbroken  broken-hearted  heavy-hearted  low-spirited  in the doldrums  sad  unhappy  doleful  melancholy  miserable  woebegone  forlorn  long-faced  fed up  wretched  glum  gloomy and dismal and to add insult to injury I had to actually eat some vegetables instead!! Ohhhhh how the mighty have fallen!  Please can you find out what is going on with your Free From range and give it some tender loving care  if not for me but for all the poor vegetables out there!!

As someone who cannot eat gluten I applaud your efforts to make a free from section in store.  I am however a little confused as to how you can sell gluten free chocolate hob nobs at £3.50 for a pack containing 8 biscuits. Not only is this more than double the price of regular hob nobs  the actual biscuits are smaller! A similar comparison can be made with your gluten free beers and other products. It feels as if people like myself are penalised for wanting to enjoy your products that are safe for us to consume. Could you explain why gluten free products seem to carry a very expensive premium in your store?					2016-11-23T20:24:13+0000	1479932653	2016-11-23 21:24:13	2	11	2	0	13	11	3	8	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We got back to the car safely but on driving out  heading down the slight hill towards the petrol station  there is a zebra crossing.  A very frail old man was waiting to cross and I hit the breaks  car went from 2nd gear to 1st  and wouldn t stop.  I had to pull my handbreak on  nearly hit a lamp post and did a 360 degree turn  with my baby in the car  in order to miss the old man due to black ice/  This is absolutely ridiculous.  I did speak to a member of staff  about it but was told that someone would be out soon to grit the area.  OK  but many elderly people like to get out early to do their shopping  never mind the likes of me who prefers to shop with a baby before its bus   and I find it extremely  irresponsible that Tesco do not have someone designated on these frosty days to ensure customers safety.  its not like its an irregular occurance at this time of year that there is ice.    I am a very loyal shopper but to be honest I will rethink where I shop due to the car parking situation for my and my baby s safety.  So shocked that this is yet another year and Tesco cant get their act together to get that car park safe.					2016-11-23T20:01:57+0000	1479931317	2016-11-23 21:01:57	5	17	8	0	25	17	4	13	14	0	5	0	0	0	0	3	0

I m 8 months pregnant and there is 6% alcohol in the cream. I have eaten some without realising it contains alcohol  it was only after a few mouthfuls I realised the taste wasn t quite right for  vanilla cream  I m absolutely shocked and upset that this has happened to me!   I feel very strongly that it should be stated on the front of the packaging that it contains alcohol  especially as it is shelved with normal cream!! What if this had been given to a young child let alone my unborn child?

While washing my car at Tesco car wash in Andover on 15/11/2016  my exhaust was destroyed by the under chassis spray sytem plate. The garage manager came out and admitted that the plate wasn t mounted back correctly by maintenance. I luckily took pictues showing that it was not placed back on its base correctly. I filed a damage clain in store. Today I received a letter from Tesco saying that their technician checked it and said that it was in perfect working order. I returned to the car wash today and the spray plate has been reset correctly. Again I took pictures of it. Not happy about being lied to when they are clearly at fault. I will be filing a claim with county court on Monday.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15181668_10210011901827624_2626928341859801535_n.jpg?oh=fc417c8526066daf6e8a033e018cb2a7&oe=58DC8ECE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15181668_10210011901827624_2626928341859801535_n.jpg?oh=f87585f1f74f6b675a97f2de34c1145d&oe=591BF9C3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210011901827624&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-23T19:53:52+0000	1479930832	2016-11-23 20:53:52	4	5	6	0	11	1	1	0	1	0	4	0	2	0	0	0	0

A couple of hours later we had another delivery.... flowers and a card from Tesco Redditch to congratulate us! I was touched beyond words  it was a beautiful gesture.

I place a weekly grocery order with you once a week for approx £70-£80 each time  usually I ll do click and collect.   On a number of occasions I have been told that items are out of stock  only to then go in to store and discover the stuff is right there on the shelves!   On at least two of these occasions you have charged me a minimum basket charge because the alleged out of stocks left my basket below £40...so you ve conned me out of at least £8 in false charges.   I spoke to customer services to ask for this to be refunded and my request was refused.   You absolute dishonest crooks! Not sure who to report it to first...the police for fraud or Anne Robinson on Watchdog.  Needless to say I have decided to spend my £80 per week elsewhere. It s no wonder your profits are down and your previous CFO and co are being able investigated.  Sainsbury s were the lucky winners of my custom this week in case you were wondering why my order hadn t come in...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15134631_10153859669526008_4784062663091198798_n.jpg?oh=e037377c57866537d96866fa8468720b&oe=58EF5C40	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15134631_10153859669526008_4784062663091198798_n.jpg?oh=181996e048f03b818ab03dad3baf8ee3&oe=591F604D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153859669526008&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-23T18:42:33+0000	1479926553	2016-11-23 19:42:33	6	28	6	0	34	27	8	19	21	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

They re due to be delivered tomorrow . They ve all been paid for the money has cleared from my bank and where all in stock. At the time of ordering .. now given they re all paid for and where in stock and I have email confirmation of the order I would expect all items I have ordered and paid for would be delivered tomorrow as planned .. well how wrong was i.. get a phone call tonight one item is out of stock .. when I asked why as I have ordered and the money has been taken from my bank and received by Tesco there for the items are mine and should not be sold again as they have already been bought .. apparently Tesco you don t feel that s something you should do and so continued to let the item go out of stock and I was met with  it doesn t mean is reserved  well no mate it doesn t as it s been bought and paid for it means it s (or should be) mine .. and so in simple terms Tesco you have sold an item that belongs to me I have proof of purchase therefore it is incredibly unreasonable and unacceptable that you ve done so . To add insult to injury this item was in the three for two and one of the more expensive items (£33) so I said ok so your refunding the £33 then I was met with no .. you will be paying full price for the item that again I have proof of purchase for and should of been and shows on the receipt as the free item as now (through no fault of my own one item is it if stock and I m not eligible for the 3 for 2 deal) so not only is one of my sons Christmas presents not arriving tomorrow but you also are refusing to refund me the full price of it .... if I had known this would of been the case I would of shopped elsewhere and will likely be doing so from now on . I have been very loyal customer I shop with you weekly for food and also for my children s school uniforms   Christmas and birthday presents and have spent upwards of £300 on toys in the last week from you guys ..  .. I have spoken to numerous people who agree this situation is appalling  and extremely bad practice ..					2016-11-23T18:31:36+0000	1479925896	2016-11-23 19:31:36	0	37	12	5	54	35	18	17	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	12	0

As consumers we cant tell this until the first two bites ..   So either warn consumers they may be unripe when buying or work with your suppliers to help improve the ripening process.  When you eat an unripe astringent persimmon (American or Asian) the mouth immediately draws up. Sometimes you ll get a hint of sweetness (if it is near-ripe) but the mouth-feel is immediate.  I now know you can hasten ripening by leaving persimmons in a paper bag along with an apple  which produces extra ethylene to soften the fruit.   But frankly after two unripe ones I wont be wanting to bite into another for a long time.					2016-11-23T17:37:15+0000	1479922635	2016-11-23 18:37:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I was in your st rollox Glasgow store and went to buy these for my kids. They have already bought just about all the small ones so getting a big one was going to be a special treat. However upon scanning at the till the code was not on file. The lady at the till called over what I can only presume to be a supervisor who shouted  £7.50. I said they re not they are only £7 to which she replying well if they are not on file you can buy them. She snatched them out of the cashiers hand and walked off.   It was disgusting behaviour to be honest. No sorry no explanation just bad manners!   I then went to the customer service desk where the girl after leaving her post and going to check came back. Tried scanning them. Tried keying them in and apologies and explained that if they weren t on file then she couldn t sell them as their may or may not be a health and safety issue. Her manner was fantastic.  Leaving me with 2 unhappy but accepting children.    So my question is this. Can these animotsu large plush please be put on file so I can come and get them.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15171175_10154413022259442_1673497886776093716_n.jpg?oh=3db0a9b43e0a427c14fe0f5ed56d0f2e&oe=58EB530E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15171175_10154413022259442_1673497886776093716_n.jpg?oh=7903c114566b79982cfacddde4113090&oe=591AEFE8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154413022259442&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-23T17:25:48+0000	1479921948	2016-11-23 18:25:48	1	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

I received £20 worth of Clubcard vouchers in the post and ordered a product through Tesco Direct using the vouchers to get money off the total spend. This order was then cancelled (by yourselves not me) due to stock issues. I have just attempted to use my Clubcard vouchers online to exchange for Pizza Express vouchers only for me to be told that I have already used the vouchers. I have phoned the  helpline  to be then told I now have to wait until NEXT YEAR to re-receive these vouchers. This to me seems utterly ridiculous and a very poorly designed system. Please can you offer any help?					2016-11-23T16:11:12+0000	1479917472	2016-11-23 17:11:12	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was shopping alone for some essentials when my 11 week old daughter started kicking off. I decided that enough was enough and went to pay for my items. That s how I came across Kath  a member of your team. She told me to take my time and how can she help. Kath helped with my daughter whilst I sorted her feed and put my shopping on the belt. I couldn t grab the trolley when feeding her so the lady working on the checkout next to me brought it down along with my shopping. Kath then pushed my trolley over to the bench so I could sit and feed her comfortably. I m so grateful for how Kath helped me and stopped me from stressing out lol. She s a credit to your company!! If you could pass the message on that would be great!! Thank you again. Regards. 😀					2016-11-23T15:33:22+0000	1479915202	2016-11-23 16:33:22	344	24	365	30	419	24	17	7	42	0	341	18	2	0	0	0	0

I was bought a purse like this by a wee friend but I accidentally left it on the bus on the way home from my Uni placement last night and unfortunately it hasn t been handed in : ( I don t care about the money that was inside but I m gutted about the purse because the little lady who bought it for me asks me if I have it whenever I see her!  I really don t want to think about the sad look on her face when I tell her I lost it  so I m really hoping you might have one somewhere at Tesco Towers that I can buy!

As I m sure many people understand  this time of year is the busiest for the members of the NHS and emergency services. What many people don t understand is that we may be expected to work for 12 hours without breaks if required. That s half a day without food  drink or even loo breaks. Yesterday  the local Tesco stores donated a large amount of mince pies to our ambulance station. These have been gratefully received  and have made many hungry paramedics very happy.  Thank you all and Merry Christmas 🎄  Written by a colleague of mine but sent with my heartfelt thanks too.					2016-11-23T14:43:38+0000	1479912218	2016-11-23 15:43:38	4	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	1	0	3	2	0	0	0	0	0

My 10 year old granddaughter was lucky enough to win a family cinema ticket to see the new Trolls movie at our local Tesco extra in Pool Redruth Cornwall. At the time of entering we didn t realise that there was no odeon cinemas in Cornwall and that if she was lucky enough to win she would need to travel well over a 100 miles to take up the prize. She was delighted when her mum received the email telling her that they had won but imagine her disappointment when they looked to see where the nearest odeon was Exeter or Taunton!! Practically up country to us way down in Cornwall!! So I phoned Pool Tesco today and spoke to a very nice man who tried his best to help with changing the tickets but unfortunately it was out of his control and gave me the number for your head office customer service. Unfortunately the lady there was not so helpful!! She said she was sorry that my granddaughter was upset but it was an odeon promotion and out of Tesco s hands. When I questioned this she told me not to shout which I was most certainly not doing!! she said she couldn t speak to me if I raised my voice which if the conversation was recorded I think you will find I was not doing and yes I probably sounded angry as I am and upset for my granddaughter and with Tesco for making no effort to help!! She also said that the adult with my granddaughter should of check first before entering but obviously she assumed it was local!! So my question is why have a promotion in Cornwall why not check first and make it acceptable to all making sure there is an cinema taking part in the region!!what would happen if they are unable to take up the prise is there an alternative or will it just go to someone else which will upset her even more??					2016-11-23T14:27:32+0000	1479911252	2016-11-23 15:27:32	1	7	5	0	12	7	2	5	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	4	0

I tapped the pepper on the side and a moth looking thing came out and is now residing on my kitchen side!  The peppers aren t even out of date etc  and even if they were how did this get in there in the first place?!   I am so disgusted  I am so lucky I noticed the state of the pepper before I put it in my baby s food!   I have now thrown all my peppers away as I can t even bring myself to look at the others and the best part is  I only got this all delivered on Monday!!

Went to your  Blackpool Extra store last night and know for a fact that our branded shop would have been £2 cheaper at morrisons. The receipt states we ve saved 70p! When querying with the manager we were told you compare the whole basket shop....even your own Tesco label products. How is this a BRAND match and how can you compare products that are not available in other supermarkets I.e. your own products. If this is the case you are falsely advertising your Brand Match Guarantee scheme  which states no less than twice on the bottom of your receipts  your BRANDED basket was £x cheaper  as opposed to your shopping was £x cheaper. More accurate to call it a PRICE match if it includes ALL products not just branded products but as I ve said how can you match items that are exclusively your own!					2016-11-23T13:24:14+0000	1479907454	2016-11-23 14:24:14	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered 2 Lego set on 08/11/16 to be sent to my local store.  I got an email saying it would be delivered into store on 10/11/16.  Date came and went with no confirmation of delivery.  I want to the store on 18/11/16 to see if it had arrived and I hadn’t been sent confirmation but sadly it hadn’t arrived.  The lady I spoke to at the store was very helpful and apologetic that my order wasn’t there.  She took my number said she would look into it and call me back and as promised she called me later that day to say it had been delivered to the wrong store and it had been re-ordered for me and would be re delivered into my local store (Market Harborough).  I got an email to say it would be delivered into store on 22/11/16.  I got text alerts saying it was going to delivered on the 22nd but I didn’t get any confirmation that it had been delivered so I then checked the delivery address only to find yet again it has gone to the wrong store 53 miles away from me!!!!  Come on Tesco is it that difficult to send my order to the correct place  it is one of your own stores after all????? What now another attempted delivery to another incorrect store???  I ordered these for a Christmas gift for my godson who lives in Ireland  a family member was going to take them over for me but as they fly out tomorrow morning I will now have the added expense of posting them or waiting and taking them with me when I go to see him next year. Another fail by Tesco direct (completely separate order) just last week I ordered a printer cartridge to be sent to my local store.  I placed and paid for the order only to have an email 2 hours later saying it’s not in stock so they have cancelled my order and will process a refund which took 3 days why don t they know their stock levels? I’ve only placed 4 orders with Tesco Direct and 2 of them have been a disaster – do I want to use Tesco Direct again? At this moment in time I’m thinking no!

This may seem like a little thing but trust me it is a huge thing when shopping with twins so once again  l thank you 😊					2016-11-23T12:20:44+0000	1479903644	2016-11-23 13:20:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a cake for my husband s birthday  it wasn t available  so they rang to check that a substitute was suitable.  When my delivery arrived  the girls that had picked it  had included a card and present for my husband!  Then  to top it all  the delivery driver had stopped on his way to me  to buy me (out of his own pocket) a bunch of flowers  so I didn t feel left out!!  These staff went out of their way and beyond the call of duty  to make our day  to do this for people they don t know is amazing selfless and I can t praise them enough. Please give them huge pay rises  as whatever you are paying them won t be enough!     I will pm you with my delivery details  so that you know who your wonderful staff are.  If you see this post and it was you  please be aware that I am so thankful and I wish you all a very happy Christmas xxxx					2016-11-23T11:57:02+0000	1479902222	2016-11-23 12:57:02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There was 1 helpful member of staff out of the 4 that were there. Unfortunately I didn t make note of the names. One lady in particular will probably end up being shouted at  at some point because she is so rude. I was after a refund or credit note for a jumper that I bought on 14/10/16 because it was so missed shaped after the second wash. She didn t believe me and said that I must have worn it more than that.  I had my receipt with me  I paid £18 for it. I was only offered a £12 exchange (with a huff from her) and I had to go and find something there and then not allowed to come back another day when I had time to look and I was only allowed to use the exchange code for another item of clothing   nothing else. I take great pride in my clothes and they made me feel like I was scummy con artist trying to diddle them. 🙁 poor show T3sco and shame on your staff for being rude 🙁					2016-11-23T11:44:01+0000	1479901441	2016-11-23 12:44:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Absolutely nothing on the shelves  given them by a manager then spent twenty minutes at self service because they hadnt been security tagged which confused the tills and staff member. Then had to wait another ten minutes for someone to clear the till when it wouldn take the money. She walked past three times despite the light flashing and ignored it. The store continue to put this woman on self service (Irish woman called June) despite the fact she stands talking most of the time ignoring the lights flashing then is rude when someone calls her over. Will stick to Wellingborough branch in future!!!					2016-11-23T10:30:54+0000	1479897054	2016-11-23 11:30:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My parents collected it yesterday  and this is how it was packaged. What s the point in wrapping the box in bubble wrap to protect it if someone then sticks three strips of parcel tape directly  to the front of the box?! My parents can t give him this as a present  it looks like it been retrieved from a bin. So they now have to mess about heading back to the store to return it for replacement  and then back again to collect another one! Not acceptable Tesco!! 😡😡	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15170987_10157808136465343_8430700709585667272_n.jpg?oh=bc843a8b8c7c540d6fdff2746271b1d5&oe=58E95B92	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15170987_10157808136465343_8430700709585667272_n.jpg?oh=44b9bcf5e2557d698a1ffb8220004195&oe=58E33F9F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157808136465343&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-23T10:12:39+0000	1479895959	2016-11-23 11:12:39	3	9	4	0	13	9	3	6	5	0	3	0	0	0	0	1	0

One of your Edinburgh stores makes state school pupils queue to enter the shop and lets private school pupils in without queuing.   Absolute disgrace  enforcing preferential treatment for the wealthy.   Does Tesco have a policy of discriminating against any other demographics (BAME  LBGTQ) or is it just the working class?   I won t be visiting your stores again  it s equally convenient for me to visit co-op and Morrisons as it is your outlets. I ll be encouraging friends and family to do the same.					2016-11-23T09:20:11+0000	1479892811	2016-11-23 10:20:11	4	5	4	0	9	5	3	2	5	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

The duty manager Christine and many members of the staff were exemplary in their care and consideration of my Mum  sorting out her shopping ensuring she was warm( getting a scarf and gloves for her)attending to my Dad calling for an ambulance. Hannah took charge of Mums phone and contacted me and put out a tannoy message for Mick  my husband  who by coincidence was shopping there. My Dad has been admitted to hospital   he had a cardiac arrest and after he was settled in   we went back to Tescos to pick up Dads car. Karen was the duty Manager and she was lovely   confirming that Chris had dropped off Mums shopping personally at home 10 mins previously. She then handed Mum a beautiful bunch of flowers Sure enough the shopping was waiting with a get well card for Dad  my mums favourite wine and a bunch of roses. Mum and me cannot thank everyone enough for the way they dealt with the emergency.					2016-11-23T09:10:14+0000	1479892214	2016-11-23 10:10:14	17	11	22	2	35	11	6	5	9	0	17	5	0	0	0	0	0

You sent me some vouchers to spend  In store only  this weeks being £12 off.. I emailed this morning not really expecting you to even email back.. I asked if it was possible to exchange the in store vouchers for ones I could use online as the weather has been quite horrible today & didn t want to drive on it with my baby.. Had a lovely email back from you only a few hours later with the voucher code to use online! That s what I call customer service ☺️ Thanks again Tesco & we will be doing our Christmas food shop with you obviously ☺️ x					2016-11-22T22:05:01+0000	1479852301	2016-11-22 23:05:01	5	4	5	0	9	4	2	2	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

The delivery service is fantastic  and the staff are always unbelievably helpful. Today was a great example. Just before our delivery was due I noticed one of the wheels on my wheelchair was coming loose and we couldn t do a quick fix as both my wife and I are disabled. The two man crew delivered our shopping and fixed my wheelchair in a matter of minutes. They really are a great bunch of people  every single one of them  week in  week out. Thank you Tesco Southport  from one very grateful couple :)					2016-11-22T21:48:12+0000	1479851292	2016-11-22 22:48:12	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m very disgusted as I ate a majority of the nuts before finding this... I hope that you will be doing something about this.

Since when did it become OK to make our children 2nd class citizens?  Obviously with you TESCO it became OK today!!!  Well my husband and I will not use Tesco again until this DISCRIMINATION is ended.    For anyone reading this then google Tesco Bruntsfield Metro Store.  Where the children from the local state school are made to queue up outside behind a barrier whilst the children from the private school are allowed to enter the store however they like?  What next Tesco?  Customers who live in social housing or on benefits only allowed in your stores when those who are working having finished shopping and gone home to rest after working hard all day?

My Son requires these for his cookery lesson tomorrow and I have had the usual 12 hours notice for ingredients  although he received the list last week - evidently I thrive on a challenge. I could find butter beans  kidney beans  runner beans  broad beans  a rather dated Christmas dvd of Mr Bean (remember when he got the turkey stuck on his head? Oh how we laughed!!) but alas  no haricot beans. I have therefore resorted to buying baked beans and washing off the tomato sauce (by the way  a 420g tin of baked beans only contains 205g of actual beans...he needed 200g - lucky for him  I wouldn t have gone back for more) and I have told him to add them at the end rather than cook for 20 minutes and end up with something resembling houmous. I know he may never win Masterchef - especially with a Mother who has packed dried mixed herbs (with  bay  added to the ingredients list in pen) instead of buying the required fresh thyme  parsley  garlic etc  but I will be expecting a formal apology from Tesco if he loses marks over the haricot beans. Now  you will have to forgive me but I have a dvd to watch...gotta love Rowan Atkinson!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15193676_10207743991386730_7715617494660374891_n.jpg?oh=50bb07c98783ebff460e0348158b3bad&oe=58E4DB10	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15193676_10207743991386730_7715617494660374891_n.jpg?oh=594c6ece5d1e3f230e4fc4e49c4e4fd4&oe=58D838B7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207743991386730&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-22T20:45:10+0000	1479847510	2016-11-22 21:45:10	17	5	26	1	32	5	1	4	7	0	17	1	0	8	0	0	0

Anyway  they offered that the shopping could be rescheduled.. Fine.  But I will have to pay again.. I already paid.  Again!?! Why?? You still have my money.. I have no food and important stuff my family needs.  No wonder your customer service guy was quick to put the phone down!!

When I had my first baby 19 months ago we were quick to realise he had a milk/diary/egg allergy  which meant that we had to refrain from giving him a lot of food products. As a first time mum I felt nervous and became overly cautious planning his meals and what he could eat. However  thanks to Tescos we came across the  free from  range and my son has been having the pasta  spaghetti  Yoghurt  Chocolate chip cookies  Chocolate buttons etc. which he thoroughly loves. It also gives me the satisfaction knowing that he isn t  missing out like any other young child. I just want to thank you and show my appreciation for all your hard work and commitment in delivering good customer care and service.   Best regards   M Khanom-Bundu					2016-11-22T19:48:32+0000	1479844112	2016-11-22 20:48:32	13	4	15	1	20	4	2	2	5	0	13	2	0	0	0	0	0

The penguin one that has built in flashy lights which flash every time the jumper is moved . Is there a way to turn the lights off so I can save the battery power for when I want to actually have them flashing .? I m worried they are going to die before Xmas is over ☹️ . Also how to wash it with batteries built in ? I love the jumper but just want it to last as long as possible 😊					2016-11-22T19:25:00+0000	1479842700	2016-11-22 20:25:00	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They told me that as I made the purchase over 6 weeks ago and only just discovered the issue that it s not their policy to investigate! I said I wasn t bothered about the refund but thought they may wish to follow up with the supplier  but no  we don t keep records that far back and it s not our policy  surely that s why items have batch codes?  I sincerely hope the next person to find a lump of plastic in their pasta also spots it and doesn t cook it or choke on it!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15181637_10154349589184864_1387614145279878750_n.jpg?oh=5786e4a0e6d3683a932eee91b2300862&oe=58E6F91B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15181637_10154349589184864_1387614145279878750_n.jpg?oh=2ebf3640aa353d1c7d1a5ab7d1dd4860&oe=58E35616	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154349589184864&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-22T19:23:23+0000	1479842603	2016-11-22 20:23:23	5	6	9	1	16	5	3	2	1	0	5	0	3	0	1	0	0

Received text to say there had been a delay and order would be here by 6.23pm. Did not arrive and no further communication. Called  customer services  only to be greeted by the rudest person I think I ve ever spoken to on the phone. Informed me there had been an hour delay and when I replied by telling him it was unacceptable (I have a young child to put to bed and there had been no call to inform me of the further delay) I was told it wasn t his fault and what was he supposed to do. Not entirely sure how your call centre staff are trained but I would have thought that keeping a (loyal) customer happy would be on the list of things he could do. I said I wanted compensation (as Ocado offer for late deliveries) and was told to call back when the order eventually arrives!!

After waiting for ages in the que with just one person on the till i finally got served  i was cashing in my coinstar money. I explained to the woman that a member of staff told me the night before that i could cash it in today as customer service was closed after 10pm last night & she replied with a straight no so i then asked her how i can get my £15 because im not wasting £15 of my money and she just told me no again and to ring the number on the receipt so i then told her that her staff has been giving out wrong information to customers then because they told me i could still cash it in!! I was disgusted by her lack of customer service she gave me & didn t even look at my receipt so i happily rang head office and they told me to bring it back in store as i should of had my money in the first place !i was happy with the other lady who served me as she herself questioned why a member of staff didn t cash it in the first place & with it having the tesco information on the receipt should of been cashed in still regardless of what day it was printed! Was not happy with the service and the woman who refused me needs to learn on her customer skills because i don t think she knew what she was doing anyways!					2016-11-22T18:50:40+0000	1479840640	2016-11-22 19:50:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would be grateful if you could rethink terminating this service  not just for my mother  but for all the other people who use this service. It is a lifeline for so many in Moreton.

A hole nicely sized to unwittingly lose a customer s car & house keys down when pushing goods toward bagging? With a RUBBISH BIN PLACED UNDERNEATH to ensure they are lost forever by the time it s later realised what must have happened to them???   That s the only thing they think can have happened to ours after we couldn t find them during bagging Friday night. The fob had been scanned and the assistant thought she had given them back  so we assumed they would turn up later in a pocket or bag. Staff the next morning were pleasant and helpful  but they are gone for good and I m thankful they weren t the only set.					2016-11-22T16:48:02+0000	1479833282	2016-11-22 17:48:02	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And I know for a fact you shouldn t freeze  unfreeze and re-freeze a product. Both things could lead to food poisoning and this is a Tesco that I shop in daily.

Asked an assistant  Oh ! they are under the  Tomato and pulses because they are pulses  Me  Ok!  went and got them thought I might buy some peas were they there no chance. In the conversation with said assistant asked why there was no Alpro Coconut milk   head office has stopped us selling it    stopped lots of things that people want . I got the idea that she was fed up with people asking for things they do not sell now  no more excuses just blame who is to blame. Thing is apart from Xmas goods in the shop from September there is a myriad of things no one buys yet they are still on the shelf.					2016-11-22T15:53:50+0000	1479830030	2016-11-22 16:53:50	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your company practices a zero customer service level. I am guessing like most people I spend on average £400 a month within your stores and petrol stations  meaning £4800 annually and nearly a quarter of million in a lifetime  obviously you could not give a toss about my custom so I am now forced to shop with Sainsburys instead.   I have had 3 fob off emails 2nd  9th and 18th from Amanda Clark.   This my initial complaint and responses.   Order ref:19218800  Yesterday evening our delivery arrived at our door with 12 free range eggs on top of the crates  as per your standard practice  except every single egg was smashed with all of their contents covering the rest of our order. This in turn went all over our carpet and was spread through the hallway and kitchen. We had to wash everything before drying it and then putting them away  plus scrubbing our carpet and mopping the kitchen. The driver was apologetic  however this is not the first issue we have had with the online service  although it is the first time I have decided to voice this to yourselves. We have always shopped with you guys either in store or online as I am sure you can see from my clubcard  but the so called convenience of online is not what I experienced last night after getting home from work. I encourage you to smash 12 eggs and see just how much mess this creates  plus the inconvenience of then not having 12 eggs that you ordered.  I made a complaint last week reference this order. I was called by your HQ on 27th at 10:06am and they were very understanding of my issue and said that a member of staff would call me shortly from the Aylesford depot with a resolution. Someone then called me from a mobile number 07718 534425 at 10:23am I had to explain my issue all over again to him  he then said that he will call me back in the next few minutes once he had spoken to his manager. That phone call never came  so I called back at 16:53 and spoke to a woman who was very rude abrupt and unhelpful. I asked her if someone could call me back first thing in the morning  something that again never happened. I rang the main customer service number on the 28th at 15:52 and was told there is nothing that could be done until the depot call me. We are now Monday and I have heard nothing. It is obvious to me that my custom means nothing to Tesco so I will not be shopping with your brand anymore.					2016-11-22T14:54:10+0000	1479826450	2016-11-22 15:54:10	3	4	3	0	7	4	1	3	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called at 13:05 to advise that my food shop hadn t been delivered as of yet. I was told by a man that I was texted at 9am saying that delivery was 45mins late. I kindly told the man that I hadn t got this text hence my call.  So I waited  and waited and waited. nOTHING! I call again at 13:52 and spoke to a very helpful man called Tom. He politely apologised for the unconvinced and said he ll look into this  he even offered to call me back. I replied with  no thank you I ll hold .. Tom put me on hold  so he could look at notes and contact driver. After some time Tom came back and said that he can t reach the driver. Drivers log states he was back in store at 12:08 as round done. Well obviously it wasn t as I haven t received my food shop. He said he will contact the branch and was I ok to still hold. Well of course i was. Tom came back and said that the store (Erith) had told him  that the driver was out of he s hours. So has returned to store with my shopping as well as another customers. This was extremely frustrating as firstly I was told after first call that it was running 45 mins behind then To be told that driver was out of there hours. Well how can they be if they already know it s running 45 mins late  then surely they already know if the driver is going too be at end of he s shift!!!!! Yet I m still waiting and no contact has been made to apologise or let me know. Tom said that the store (Erith) has said that both deliveries will be out for this afternoon drop of 14:00-18:00. This is a joke and an insult  I booked a time slot  in fact an hour time slot. The most frustrating part is that I have now had to spend this time chasing delivery and typing this post. I was due to go to hospital at 2pm as my mum has had a stroke and these are the visiting times. Now I m late seeing her and having to cut the time short to rearrange childcare. No consideration given by the store what so ever. This is not the first time either!! Extremely disappointed in the customer service given by the Erith branch. If it wasn t for Tom  I would still be in the dark as to where my delivery is. I ve now had to get my neighbour to sit at mine to wait for delivery. One very disappointed customer!!!  Whilst I have been typing I have received a good will gesture voucher for £10. His doesn t help with the lack of customer service shown and the fact I m still having to add more stress to my plate to sort out my shopping being delivered.					2016-11-22T14:34:28+0000	1479825268	2016-11-22 15:34:28	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am writing in regards to a particuarly nasty and upsetting incident this lunch time.  Just been to the Tesco Express in broadmead and slipped over on a broken white wine bottle (so am here in my office with a painful knee and stinking of booze).  The staff inside the staff were not helpful or sympathetic in any way.  The way you can rectify this would be by doing 2 things: 1)  Train your staff in how to deal with spillages.  When something is spilled  get a member of staff to stand by the spill and direct people round it whilst another goes to get a wet floor sign.  This is very basic (was when I worked in a supermarket) but wasn t done.  Customers were (hurriedly) walking though the liquid and glass with no warning.   2)  Train your staff on customer service.  When staff see someone is hurt they should show empathy.  They should ask whether the customer is OK  and possibly help them to their feet.  They shouldn t just say  they re cleaning there... .  I was obviously embarrassed after crashing to the floor  in pain  worried about possible glass in my knees or clothing and got no support from the staff.  The cleaner who was in the area (I assume dealing with another spill/another part of the spill) didn t even make eye contact.					2016-11-22T14:10:24+0000	1479823824	2016-11-22 15:10:24	0	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

Maybe not your fault directly  but your crappy customers! Turned up with my nearly 3 year old and 3 month old  only shopping here as I could park underground. Drive to the parent and baby spits and could I get one? No. drove round twice. Finally  saw one man sat in his car  door open. Clearly no intention of leaving. Drove along a bit and a woman was sat in her car  lights on. Sat indicating behind her until another driver came behind me and felt unable to see I was waiting for a spot and therefore drive around me. So I gave up. And parked over two spots to enable me to get my doors open fully so as to access the car seats safely. By the time I had the kids put the car - along with my changing bag and bag of bags - I started walking to where the baby trollies are and the second parking spot hogger leaves - with no baby or small person in her car!! Oh yes  she had a car seat  but it was very much empty!! So this selfish cow knows what it s like to take small children shopping  yet still feels so entitled that she takes a spot when alone!! (If you are reading this love  I hope you struggle getting parked somewhere suitable the next time that car seat is occupied!!)   So as I say  this is obviously not your fault but maybe you could have a few more baby spots?? Maybe some that could be parent and child OR disabled to go alongside those you already have?? Or maybe you could find people abusing these spots?? I bet a month of someone s wages would be recouped in a week from people parking there with no kids or with teenagers sat in the car! Or those really annoying ones where one parent stays in the car with the kids and the other goes in - why do they need the spot??  I m thoroughly wound up now today and blame Tesco s entirely!!					2016-11-22T13:39:56+0000	1479821996	2016-11-22 14:39:56	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I kept the cake until Sunday as that was when her Birthday was and when had a slice of the cake it was very dry like it had been stored for weeks totally ruined the end of the birthday celebrations we still have the cake which I am hoping to return to the shop this evenignbut can t find my receipt but paid for it on my card and can give you a rough time etc.Then today I popped to grab a fresh loaf sliced and this is also dry like it s been sat there a day or 2 not fresh what so ever.

After trying numerous times over the weekend to order toys on the 3 for 2 offer without success  from Tesco direct  I was advised by the online team to try in store. Unfortunately the items I wanted were not available in store. Though not actually on the customer service desk Karen was present when I queried about any other options to order. This lady was obviously very busy with other things yet took about 40 minutes helping me with the online computer in store. The problem was one of the items was coming from a third party and therefore not applicable to the deal  although was showing as 3 for 2 on the site. Unfortunately the in store computer crashed when we finally got the the payment screen with one alternate product. I did return home and place my order saving a huge amount of money which I would have missed out on without Karen s informative help.					2016-11-22T11:27:39+0000	1479814059	2016-11-22 12:27:39	5	3	5	0	8	3	1	2	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is my little boy s 4th birthday tomorrow. We took advantage of your great 3 for 2 deal and ordered him some toys from Tesco  the main one being this JCB ride on. We wanted a different one  but you couldn t guarantee delivery before his birthday so we settled on this one which was due to arrive at Tesco Brigg yesterday. I arrived this morning at Tesco Brigg to collect it only to be told  it is in transit  and  things are a bit mad because of the 3 for 2 offer.  It s not good enough I m afraid. As a loyal customer of Tesco for many years  needless to say  I am really disappointed.

I was waiting for the receptionist at my sons special needs school and he walks in and stood there for a matter of seconds huffs asking where is the receptionist  i replied that she just had to pop off quickly. Well that just wasnt good enough for your driver. He said to me that if she didnt hurry up he would leave as he has other deliveries to make. Im sorry tesco but that is unacceptable attitude that your driver has. Let s just hope his next delivery isnt an elderly person. All it takes is just a little care and thoughtfulness that goes along way and he did not have any of those qualities and to top it he wasn t even stood waiting for any longer than 2 mins.					2016-11-22T10:01:56+0000	1479808916	2016-11-22 11:01:56	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an order on 17/11/2016 online for the 3 for 2 Christmas decorations for collection from store. I received a text message to inform me that part one of my order was ready for collection from store (Friday). I have been into store twice since and still nothing. Part 2 still has not arrived. I called tesco today who informed me that my order had been sent for dispatch however it hasn t left the warehouse. She informed me that she would look into sending the order out again but the earliest I would receive this would be Saturday. Really not acceptable  an order that was placed on 17th for next day delivery not being received until 26th at the earliest.					2016-11-22T10:00:11+0000	1479808811	2016-11-22 11:00:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A Tesco store in Edinburgh has been accused of discriminating against state school children by making them queue outside while private school pupils are allowed to come and go as they please.  It has been claimed that students from Boroughmuir high school  near the city centre  were made to stand behind a barrier by Tesco staff and only allowed to enter their local store in small groups. But students at the nearby George Watson’s college were not stopped at all.  The issue was raised by a parent of one child at the state school  who said it was a “form of discrimination”. Neil Pollock  a professor of innovation and social informatics at Edinburgh university  said: “Everybody should queue or nobody should queue.”  Advertisement  He told the Guardian: “My son is at Boroughmuir. He has to stand in the queue each day. He’s not one to complain but it was getting him down - so we decided to do something. He and his friends are frustrated because they have to wait outside whilst others go ahead of them. Tesco also ‘police’ the door in that they have a person there making sure they queue.”  Pollock said the pupils were “pretty angry” about the situation  saying his son and his friends were “really pleased that some one is finally taking it up for them. They don’t want to get into trouble  or to present their school in a bad light but they just think it is unfair.”  He said his son  who he asked not to be named  once tried to walk in behind a group of students from George Watson’s college. “The staff member sent him – but not the Watson’s boys – out off the shop.”  Pollock posted his complaint on Twitter last week and a Tesco representative responded with a series of tweets  telling him: “I’ve called the store and spoke to the duty manager  John... He said the private school normally have a lesser amount of children which is quicker and easier for the store.”  After Pollock indicated he was not happy with that explanation  a Tesco representative tweeted: “I agree we cannot have different rules.”					2016-11-22T09:29:31+0000	1479806971	2016-11-22 10:29:31	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just want to highlight the constant issues surrounding the Parent and Child parking at this store. Often its used by people with no children in their cars; people with car seats and no children; people with “children” well over 21; people using it as disabled parking.  The last time I came  I had to park at the row nearest the motorway as there were no parent and child spaces and upon going round store – very few actual children with their parents.   There is limited Parent and Child parking as it is and plenty of disabled and generic parking. Its my understanding the parent and child area should be for those with children under 12 years of age – and not just utilized by those selfish  lazy people taking away parking with extra room for those who need it.					2016-11-22T09:01:06+0000	1479805266	2016-11-22 10:01:06	4	3	4	0	7	3	1	2	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was quite alarmed when I bit on to something very hard. It turns out it was a stone. An actual stone! At 39 weeks pregnant the last thing I need is a broken tooth or to choke on a stone! There is no way this was able to get in to my bowl any other way than coming out of the bag of Tesco Swiss Style Musli. I m only grateful that it was me eating the cereal and not my 3 year old son who often enjoys musli for his breakfast. I have sent a private message to this Facebook page but have had no response. Please could somebody contact me regarding this.

Retailers & Marketeers of the U.K. Ok  you win  we now have to suffer the ridiculous  Black Friday  - something unheard of in the UK until 3 years ago....  But is it REALLY necessary to start the following:- Black 5 Days - Morrisons Black Tag Event - Currys Black Friday from 14-25 November (eh?) - Amazon UK Black Friday for 11 days (wtf??) - Tesco Etc etc etc etc  I don t think I m alone when I say consumers of the U.K. aren t stupid. We know the discounts on offer are limited in quantity & we even know that those  Mega-super-cosmic  deals you persistently advertise and EMAIL US ABOUT aren t actually that great a deal (we do know how to shop around you know!)   Black Friday is actually now Black November - and for me  Black November is the time where I find myself continually hitting the UNSUBSCRIBE button on your  OH MY GOD  DONT MISS THIS  emails.

False advertising from one of the  best  retailers in the country! Looking online and found 3 items all listed in their 3 for 2 offer. Thought brilliant just what I was looking for. Quite a few items in 3 for 2 listed as out of stock. But these 3 were in stock. Added to basket but charged full price! Contact them  to get some useless customer service advisor telling me that it was no longer in stock. Then told me that offer doesn t apply to that item. I then direct him to the offer on the website and he states it s because tesco aren t supplying the item directly and sourcing it from a 3rd party! I then advise legally this is false advertising and he states it is not. I then request to speak to his manager (Billy) who states one minute they don t have a complaint process  then they do once I advise him that all my calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes. He thanks me for my  feedback ! I then explain it is not feedback and it s a formal complaint  that I expect a resolution within 8 weeks to which he replies that they will not come back to me with a resolution! Trading standards will find your false advertising interesting and the fact you have no complaint procedure that your manager couldn t talk me through.....I requested a phone call back from someone more senior to which he said wasn t going to happen  after several occasions of telling him I expect a call back am told someone will call me within 5 days......	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15134692_10154061947527304_3269795244269065012_n.jpg?oh=0a08b3bfa679914dde35cb689deb1ec6&oe=58DA690F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15134692_10154061947527304_3269795244269065012_n.jpg?oh=e06582b3af50d14133058113bf6ff266&oe=58EBD202	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154061947527304&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-21T21:45:22+0000	1479764722	2016-11-21 22:45:22	0	8	3	1	12	8	5	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	2	0

I went on  all Sylvanian Families  then sorted by special offers.  After adding to basket 3 of these items (using the button on the screen below) I proceeded to the checkout to see that the saving had not been applied.  Confused  I emptied the basket and tried again producing the same outcome.  So far not a good consumer experience!  I then contacted your Contact Centre in Bury  expecting the call agent to maybe give me a code to input and trigger the discount or even take payment over the phone.  Instead he informed me that the offer wasn t available for products that were provided by a third party seller  but only those provided by Tesco.  When I questioned this  I was rudely informed  it s clearly stated on the website!   Actually when a customer follows the same path to purchase that I tried  it wasn t stated AT ALL  on any of the pages I navigated.  I asked if the offer would be honoured to be told not as  it is clearly stated  (still inaccurate).  Still not a good experience....  I asked to speak to a manager to be rudely told  there isn t one available and even if there was they would only tell you the same thing that I have.   After refusing to take no for an answer I finally spoke to a manager.  After eventually listening  he followed the path to purchase that I did and accepted that there had been no terms and conditions about the promotion on any of the pages that I had landed on. He also agreed that he could see why I felt it to be misleading but then insisted on telling me that I  should have clicked on the item and I would have seen that it didn t have 3 for 2 on that page .  Seems strange  misleading even that there (as pictured) is clearly a 3 for 2 image next to the items and I have no need to  click on the item  as under each is an add to basket button.  Experience is getting even worse...  After discussing with this manager the trades description act and the definition of changing consumer behaviour by misleading them  he finally told me there was nothing he could do as it wasn t an item being provided by Tesco.    After several more  misleading comments (seems Tesco are good at misleading) about how there were no further escalation points or more senior staff members I could speak to  and after refusing to give me the name of the Head of the Contact Centre  eventually he told me an Operations Manager (also unnamed) would phone me within 5 days!!!  Customer Service of the year award might not happen this time guys!  So  here is where we are.... 32 of the 53 Sylvanian Families items that are displayed on the picture with  3 for 2  next to it  are not actually available on the described 3 for 2 offer at all as you have no direct stock and are completing customer orders using a third party supplier.  Brilliant!  And I am supposed to wait 5 days for your unnamed Operations Manager at Bury to get in touch?  Not likely.  So please consider this as a request for intervention.  All I ask is that you honour the offer you clearly have visible on the website which is unbelievably misleading.  My next correspondence will be directly to your CEO whilst copying in trading standards.  I look forward to your response.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15178052_10154768818881340_5510722585713267533_n.jpg?oh=6efdacb61bd08fec4da1c7a6dddf0d88&oe=58D6A537	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15178052_10154768818881340_5510722585713267533_n.jpg?oh=b8a6675c4f1b00c06610be575ca1a6ec&oe=58DEC63A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154768818881340&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-21T21:19:45+0000	1479763185	2016-11-21 22:19:45	22	30	22	20	72	30	14	16	47	0	21	0	0	0	0	0	0

Loving the Xmas decs  btw.  As a reward for getting round your store without stocking up on Krispy Kremes or spending wayyyyyy too long in the clothes aisles I decided to get myself my usual refreshing treat. Your finest freshly squeezed lemonade. I know  not exactly rock and roll  but I like it! Or  at least  I did. I know that change can be a good thing  but the old saying goes  if it ain t broke  don t fix it  and it s especially true in this case.   This lovely refreshing treat of mine used to taste as if you d been hit in the face with a bag of lemons thrown out of a lemon yellow beetle on international lemon day (Tuesday August 29th 2017  btw). Now  it tastes like water that knew a lemon once. Or rather  it was a friend of a friend of a lemon  but that totally counts  right? And don t even get me started on the distinct lack of sweetness in this once wonderfully sweet and sour drink!   Wrong  Tesco  it doesn t count. Not even slightly. Please bring back my lemony treat! The  lemonade  in this bottle is a sad imposter for the lemonade I once loved!					2016-11-21T21:12:18+0000	1479762738	2016-11-21 22:12:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In a phone call today from Andrew one of your  customer care representatives  when I asked if anyone knew what they were doing because there s so much back and forth and even now I m being told contradicting information from an email he sent me this morning to what I was told in the phone call this afternoon... Andrew response to me was  well it s actually caused us quite a lot of problems trying to sort this out on your behalf  I had tried to contact the manufacturer directly as I specified many times and they told me they had to deal with tesco directly  even sent Andrew the emails to show him this. As a customer care representative is it not your duty to help and sort out problems - not moan to the customer that it s been an issue. I m fully aware it s been an issue I ve been trying to sort this out for a month!!!! He also doesn t seem to be very happy at sorting this out for me cus he added in the phone call  well we ve done our job by offering a replacement mattress ... As if that just sorts out the whole problem... CONGRATS  perhaps you d like to deliver it to me and then I will say you ve done your job properly...... I ve asked several times how I can make a complaint and not happy with the way Andrew has spoken with me today  he even sighed on the phone when I asked him a question.... I think he might be a bit fed up....I presume all your calls are recorded. I think this whole situation has been an absolute joke and I still haven t had it sorted..... In our phone call today Andrew said they attempted to deliver the mattress last week (to an old work address) but no one was in (someone is there from 7-7) and it has been  left with a neighbour and they don t know who... And no information was left at the address it should of been delivered to about where it is.... Now instead of sending out another mattress for me which I feel would be the correct thing to do in this situation and stop messing me around ...... I have to wait for him to contact the couriers  see where they ve left it  wait for them to collect it from this address and try and get them to deliver it to my home address...... Not really sure why I have to be involved in all of that					2016-11-21T21:04:18+0000	1479762258	2016-11-21 22:04:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I understand that this is because they are out of stock and only available from a partner company. It would perhaps be clearer if an algorithm was incorporated into your website to remove the 3 for 2 logo from items when tesco is out of stock.					2016-11-21T20:33:32+0000	1479760412	2016-11-21 21:33:32	6	4	6	0	10	4	3	1	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a TV and Soundbar to the tune of £400. It gave me the option to choose a day to deliver  and no option to pick it up from the store. I chose today and got an email to say they would be delivered today  CUSHTY! 11 oclock this morning  the soundbar arrived! YAY! I checked the tracking on the TV to see.. READY TO DISPATCH. Ok  I thought  lets wait  (I took the day of work for this). I chose to have it delivered today as tomorrow I have to drive 300 miles to my grandfathers funeral and then 300 miles back so won t be home  work on wednesday and the sky engineer coming out on thursday. 5pm rolls around  no sign of a tv  tracking still says READY TO DISPATCH!!! So I call the phone number on the website and was told someone will find out whats going on and call me back  no call back after an hour so I call you again....told someone will ring me back in 15 minutes  half an hour later I get the call to be told that the courier has made a mistake and only received my tv today so it is no where near to being dispatched  I would have to wait until thursday at the latest!!! Another day off work!!! I don t think so!   I did ask about a refund  5 days until the money goes back on my card  still not solving the problem of me having a tv by thursday when the sky engineer comes round. Absolutely shocking customer service! I even asked if we could have a credit put on the account so we can go to our local store to collect another one  but no  apparently this can t be done. I was given two different reasons for the mistake  1) the tv only arrived in the warehouse today so there was no chance it would be delivered today anyway (No call to let me know so i could go to work) and 2) it couldn t get here because of the weather!!! My soundbar made it ok so that doesn t wash im afraid! Finally  after talking to many staff members including a manager  I have been assured that I will get a call tomorrow (tuesday) to see if someone can give me a time slot for the delivery on wednesday instead so I don t have to take the whole day off. Lets see if this happens 					2016-11-21T20:31:03+0000	1479760263	2016-11-21 21:31:03	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst waiting for my medication(which I d paid for) a woman handed her prescription to the pharmacy assistant. The conversation went like this: Assistant: Do you pay for your prescriptions? Woman: No I don t. A: Could you tick the box pls? W: (ticks a box) A: Do you have your card? W: No   I dont have it with me. A: Ok! Your prescription will be ready soon...  At which point  the customer toddles off to do her shopping with the notion of returning to collect her meds.  I said to the assistant   i could have told you that same excuse and could have got my prescription for free couldnt i?   The assistant ignored my comment and skulked off round the back!!  I am outraged that it is so easy for people to abuse the system.  The woman in question may well be entitled to free meds on the NHS but surely requesting proof is mandatory???

Just would like to say what lovely people you have working at your Ystrad Mynach store in South Wales.   I work for the ambulance service and came to the store to attend an elderly person who had fallen. The kindness and patience they showed the injured person was touching to witness.  Not only did they assist the person off the floor and dress a wound prior to my arrival they gifted a change of clothing when the person s clothes became soiled.   Well done Tesco. Credit where it is due your staff were an asset to you today					2016-11-21T20:25:12+0000	1479759912	2016-11-21 21:25:12	71	10	74	11	95	10	4	6	14	0	70	3	0	0	0	0	0

I was told that your Rutherglen store had 8 VTech Kiddi Superstar Microphones in stock. I asked if it could be put aside for me & was told no. I made the mad dash from work to your store and after spending 15 mins trawling your shelves (which are nothing short of catastrophic) I tried to ask someone - low & behold there was no one around. I then waited about 10 mins in a queue to speak to someone  and finally when she arrived she told me that the stock information on your Tesco direct system is wrong & indeed you don t have what I m looking for. What an absolute joke you are.					2016-11-21T18:48:45+0000	1479754125	2016-11-21 19:48:45	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Kids need replacement uniform throughout the year .... who knows you may even make more sales.

I just purchased some toys off your direct site advertised as 3 for 2.  At checkout no discount was applied.  Speaking to one of your customer advisers I am told that as one of the items was not sold directly by Tesco the 3 for 2 offer does not apply.  So why is it on your site advertised as part of 3 for 2 offer?? Not happy with this false advertising.  Will now have to send all back and shop elsewhere :(					2016-11-21T16:56:44+0000	1479747404	2016-11-21 17:56:44	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

(Ask ILKLEY) I have received many useful comments and advice and one such comment suggested I post on Tesco s official site. I really hope this helps as I am desperate to sleep for longer than 40 minutes at a time before the dreaded high pitched buzzing invades my head!!!  This is a plea to all households and businesses situated around the Tesco store on Springs Lane.  For years a high pitched buzzing sound has been emitting from its roof top (?cooling system) and causing an extreme nuisance to nearby properties to the point that it s not possible to have any windows open during the night. This issue has been raised with Tesco on numerous occasions but with no satisfaction despite their understanding of the situation. Since last Thursday this has been particularly bad and very intrusive especially throughout the night and this his has got to stop! Would everyone who is affected by this please go into the store and resister your concern with the manager or write a post on here and I will ensure it s passed on.  Many thanks.					2016-11-21T15:17:21+0000	1479741441	2016-11-21 16:17:21	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They only just discovered this  and when contacting Tesco were told that a person had phoned up in August  impersonating them  and had been authorised to use the vouches. It has not been explained to them how the fraudster managed to either bypass or complete the security checks I assume were in place. They are therefore understandably extremely concerned that this could easily happen again. Most importantly  the have been told that the vouches will only be returned to them in February. I m afraid that this is completely unacceptable. My father is in his late 70s  and they were saving these vouchers to use at Christmas. These vouchers were stolen through no fault of their own  and I feel it is wrong that their Christmas should suffer because of it. My parents are loyal Tesco customers  and I feel they deserve to be treated better than this. I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible and let me know how we can get this process expedited. Thank you  Emma Butterworth					2016-11-21T14:15:51+0000	1479737751	2016-11-21 15:15:51	1	16	1	0	17	16	3	13	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called to ask what happened and was told one of the items was not provided by Tesco....so why is it still advertising on website surely this is a breach of advertising rules. I was offered a refund but would take 3-5 working days to get MY money back for an error on Tescos part. You take MY money in minutes yet expect me to wait days for a refund. The items I bought are likely to sell out and I wanted them for my son for Christmas  I now can t purchase them again at another retailer until I receive MY money back. I requested to speak to a supervisor because I do not think this is fair practice  I was told they will call and they have not as yet. I won t be compensated for my time or money that is not in my bank and my son may not get what he wants for Christmas. I couldn t speak to a supervisor and when I said I m not happy about that the call was terminated. I have emailed customer services but I also want to let your customers know that the 3for2 offer is not as good as it appears  check u haven t been charged for your 3rd item!					2016-11-21T13:55:43+0000	1479736543	2016-11-21 14:55:43	0	18	0	0	18	17	3	14	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I did an online grocery shop and  when it came to paying and I was asked for the three numbers on the back of my credit card  I thought I needed my Halifax one and input that security number only for the Nationwide  confirming card details  box to come up... which it turned out was the one I should have used. BUT  IT WENT THROUGH WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE WHATSOEVER! No wonder that Tesco had the huge security breach a few days ago if that is how good their security is! Or  should I blame Nationwide? I have just phoned them without a satisfactory conclusion hence why I am putting it out there now in the hope that something is done about this rather worrying lapse.					2016-11-21T13:27:26+0000	1479734846	2016-11-21 14:27:26	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When i asked the young lad on the produce department if he knew when it was being filled up he simply shrugged his shoulders  rolled his eyes and said not my problem. As a former employee of Tesco with 13 years service i know that this is not how you treat a customer.

Thanks   Utter Utter Utter (did is say Utter??) Rubbish!!!  Wish there had been a zero star. Bought first one and experienced the issue with the memory card corrupting the screen on boot up  bought a new (expensive sandisk) memory card  and the problem remained. Went to the garage in Carluke and got a really unhelpful assistant to eventually (after an argument) to swap it out. Got home  camera worked ok with the memory card. Daughter used it on a school trip -- went to look at the pictures  and the camera had wiped them. Paid for an app to recover the pictures from the card (which it did)  only to find the picture quality is absolute rubbish. there is no way this camera is the 720 advertised  needless to say  it will be going back to tesco tomorrow. Best advice -- dont touch this camera with a barge pole. 30 odd quid then a memory card on top is a rip off for this rubbish. £5 would be more appropriate.					2016-11-21T11:15:22+0000	1479726922	2016-11-21 12:15:22	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There has been a huge increase in the amount of people who are homeless in Bristol and there are varying projects to keep them fed and warm through the winter. I was wondering if you would be able to donate anything towards this cause  the homeless people of Bristol would be so happy to receive anything so they know we are thinking of them.

Why doesn t greedy tesco extend the delivery day and pay their workers overtime rather than put pressure on the drivers to meet more deliveries? Results in overworked stressed drivers and annoyed customers having late and missing deliveries. I wonder if there are more road traffic accidents too...					2016-11-21T09:59:05+0000	1479722345	2016-11-21 10:59:05	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not one off-the-workers said nothing to the child just went the customers we start complaining about the wet floor the security guy RE-act and said to the cleaner that she should dry the floor because a client felt and she answer to the security and what? Very irresponsible person. The child  s parent should take her to court just to she learn what is the duty of care.					2016-11-21T08:34:38+0000	1479717278	2016-11-21 09:34:38	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I pulled in there was a sign on the pumps to say no diesel - as my car is unleaded I thought I d be ok to use the pump still - there was a cone next to the bottom of the station but as the side had come off I assumed it was to stop people going near it  and as the car in front of me had used the pump I assumed I was ok to carry on  about half way though a man working there came over  looked me me  then to the cone and back to me  I asked if he was ok not understanding his gesture  to which he said I shouldn t be using the pump. I found the way he approached me extremely rude! He could of simply said  I m sorry ma am this pump is out of use  to which I would of gone and paid and left it at that! Instead embarrassing me in this was in front of other customers is just very rude! There was no signs to say the whole of bay 8 was out of use  just a scrappy piece of hand written paper to say no diesel! I visited today between 7:30am and 7:45 am! I hope he didn t ruin anyone else s day by being so rude in front of other customers!					2016-11-21T08:25:23+0000	1479716723	2016-11-21 09:25:23	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Great if you have a laptop not so great when ordering off a phone. Taken me over 2hours to scroll thru everything to order toys on the 3 for 2. Runs so so slow...takes ages to load in page and when you have 2000 odd toys to try scroll through becomes tedious! Do you have a mobile friendly site? Now going to be very grumpy with 4hours sleep 😟. Thanks for 3 for 2 offers tho. Ordered some things. Hopefully rest of what i would like will be in stock soon ☺ xx					2016-11-21T02:21:12+0000	1479694872	2016-11-21 03:21:12	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They are of high quality and very tasty. You just can t fault them. A wonderful addition to the  fresh produce available at Tesco.

We stayed up till 11pm watching tv waiting for the order to arrive  finally  at 11.05pm it turned up.  You have my home number and mobile number but no one bothered to contact me. Your customer service centre closes at 10pm so we couldn t even call to see what was happening.   The delivery driver gave the worst apology ever (I m not even sure it was an apology) and when we asked why there had been no call he muttered his manager Donna (he didn t know her surname??) was supposed to call us.... Dreadful..I look forward to my call with you tomorrow!!					2016-11-20T23:20:33+0000	1479684033	2016-11-21 00:20:33	0	8	0	0	8	8	4	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every item I have tried to purchase states 3 for 2 in the corner but when you place it in your basket it is being purchased from a company other than tesco and not actually part of the offer.  I only realised when I went to pay and saw no discount applied.  This has to be false advertising as they all clearly indicated they were part of the offer before I put them in my basket. Waste of time. I will be buying elsewhere now.					2016-11-20T19:56:48+0000	1479671808	2016-11-20 20:56:48	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The prices were reduced to start with as i would assume you d put prices up then put on the offer. So not only was it cheaper i got the 3rd item free. We kept 2 for xmas and have cheekily opened the 3rd free item. So we are all playing bingo now and our 5 year daughter is the bingo caller. She loves it and its good for learning her numbers.					2016-11-20T18:29:41+0000	1479666581	2016-11-20 19:29:41	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Very rarely are all or even the majority of pumps working  why oh why can you not put a sign saying which pumps are not functioning. Which pumps have no diesel etc. Today a complete row of pumps both sides had no diesel. A whole line of cars coming in and either reversing or having to go around. Disgraceful. Mentioned this to the young lady on the checkout who seemed more interested in chatting on her mobile phone who didn t have a clue. Fortunately there was a more senior member of staff who although off duty said he would inform the management					2016-11-20T18:17:27+0000	1479665847	2016-11-20 19:17:27	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I assume they are now on the up due to the reduction of food provided at the same price charged. For example see these two boxes of cereal both purchased on the  3 for £3 cereal deal the large one was purchased a few weeks ago and the small one this week same price charged yet significantly less food for my pound. There is also a similar discrepancy in the box sizes for other cereals the multigrain boulders to coco snaps ratio is pretty amazing as well I will post a photo of that in the comments.

Online food shop cancelled through no fault of my own. Your staff couldn t get my card to work so cancelled my order with no warning. When I called I was asked if my bank had called me. I called my bank the next day. They never called me as I had sufficient funds so must have been a technical fault. I e-mailed your customer care team and never even received an apology or a refund for the 5 months that my delivery saver won t have been used for come the end of it by 07/01/17. I decided I might have better luck in one of your stores so popped into your Hodge Hill branch yesterday about 15.30. I made the mistake of using your temperamental self service check outs. When I said to your sales assistant  excuse me   he didn t even look at me or say anything but just raised a finger up to me. Unbelievably rude!

They didn t deliver on Friday when they were due  with no contact to say why. I got up early Saturday to call them and rearranged delivery for Saturday between 8 - 9 pm. I then got a text from them to say they couldn t process payment as there weren t enough funds in my account. So I borrowed money to transfer across so they could be paid. Guess why there wasn t enough money in my account? BECAUSE THE IMBECILES HAD ALREADY CHARGED ME FOR THE DELIVERY THAT NEVER SHOWED UP. And the delivery that was due Saturday between 8 and 9pm arrived late.

In the unlikely event that we charge you more than what is advertised on the shelf edge or on the product  please visit our Customer Service Desk with your receipt for a double the difference refund.  I was in the Craswell Street store in Portsmouth today and had to ask for this as it was not automatically offered; I notice that your information poster regarding customer rights has also shrunk considerably in size and is virtually impossible to read unless you are stood right next to it which smacks to me of trying to hide customer rights! I asked the employee on the CSD why the double difference was not done automatically and her response was  it can be  it depends . On enquiring what it depended on I was told  on how much it is    I find this response unacceptable and appears to indicate that staff are either not fully trained or it is a deliberate policy.

I wanted to write you a note as I received amazing service from your Abingdon optician. Not only was it free and not only did I manage to get a Saturday appointment the same week; the optician was the best I ve ever had. I ve worn glasses for about 6 years now and have been to many different opticians; but not once has anyone explained my astigmatism. Your optician went out of his way to show me and explain to me what it meant and how my prescription had changed. He even showed me easy to understand diagrams. The ladies working in there were also amazing. My pressure test came up high so I had to do it a second time and they managed to chill me out enough that the reading dropped hugely. Outstanding service and I won t go anywhere else again 👍 please pass this on to the team- they deserve some recognition!					2016-11-20T15:26:12+0000	1479655572	2016-11-20 16:26:12	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Headed off to my local store today when I discovered an ingedient I needed was missing from my store cupboard. I was disappointed to discover you had none.  To help you plan ahead for the future I have a fun fact and a handy tip for you.  FUN FACT: The Sunday before Advent is known as  Stir up  Sunday. The reason is to do with the Anglican prayer associated with the day  but it is also the traditional day for making Christmas pudding. HANDY TIP: This is not a good day for Tesco stores to run out of mixed spice.  I hope both  of us will be better prepared next year!					2016-11-20T15:15:25+0000	1479654925	2016-11-20 16:15:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only is it mouldy it smells terrible! I appreciate your staff are busy and have to pick items quickly  but surely they are also trained to quality check items before being packed? It was also interesting to learn when speaking to your customer services department that he s had many calls about mouldy grapes....seems to be a problem here maybe?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15181254_10154356889283071_5125502660370912793_n.jpg?oh=d213ceb5e5e8ee983fdcb6f56cde8b8b&oe=58E44FB5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15181254_10154356889283071_5125502660370912793_n.jpg?oh=8c3ac239aad6829869d7caa9ffb6e300&oe=591FCBB8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154356889283071&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-20T14:12:42+0000	1479651162	2016-11-20 15:12:42	0	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0

It has not dispatched yet and I want to swap one product for another one. Stock is available I have checked on line. I know a lot of toys are currently out of stock with this offer. I have been told however that I would have to cancel my whole order and replace it....this may result in the stock being availble for others to purchase and not guarentee my order.....then I was told to refuse the whole order in store and replace it with the other item.....by this point it will be after the 21st and I will have missed the 3 for 2. Surly you have a better computer system that allows prior to dispatch an amendment to an order? seems to me that my only option is keep something I don t really want?  Can you help any further please.					2016-11-20T14:03:36+0000	1479650616	2016-11-20 15:03:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It must be true - I ordered 12 bottles of Corona and your poor  hapless staff were unable to find ANYTHING that they could possibly substitute with . . . at all. Like for instance (And I m totally out on a wing here . . . .) another sort of beer. Yep nothing could possibly satisfy my desire to posses 12 bottles of a frankly anodyne  mass market premium lager - so the team decided the best possible outcome was to deliver nothing - incredible.  Frankly I m surprised not to see this on the front pages of the tabloids and bbc news -  Disaster strikes as Britain entirely runs out of beer !!    Victory over Fiji causes mass mexican beer frenzy   or  Slightly rainy night causes rush on premium beers  -still I can only hope this terrible situation can be stabilised by the government - I eagerly await my beer rationing stamps and the instigation of  Brew for Victory .

She saw the that our car and a few others and the road was blocked because of how she had parked and the tray that was on the road ! We had an emergency to get to the hospital yet she stood there in the middle of the road arranging her trays telling us that she was legally allowed to park there ! I should have taken a picture to put it up on Facebook but forgot to do so. When you train you delivery drivers make sure they have manners and know the rules of blocking traffic. Specially when someone needs to get to the hospital. This incident happened in Swindon  Gorse hill on whitemans street. She was young with red hair.

The Parazone toilet wipes that are £1.25 per pack states clearly that these are flushable. Many people have said that they re not as they block the drainage system. Fact. No more than 3 wipes are supposed to be flushed. I rang staff at the company (Jeyes) who said that they re safe to flush. This information needs to be addressed to ensure tht we can still purchase this product for our future reference. Staff at another company (Green Shield) have stated the same information. These are sold at £1 stores. Thank you very much.					2016-11-20T12:46:02+0000	1479645962	2016-11-20 13:46:02	0	4	0	0	4	4	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the past couple of months more of my deliveries have been late than have been on time. Your live chat is also down so I can not talk to someone directly. I am unable to phone. I have filled our your contact form but as that might take a few days for a reply I thought I would message on here too. I have received two texts today telling me my order would be an hour late. At least you had the courtesy to text this time  most of the time it is half an hour late with no warning. It seems like since I have had the delivery saver you don t care when my orders get to me as you already have my money. I have complained before and received an apology but no assurances that it wouldn t happen regularly. If you say you will deliver between certain times then the majority of your deliveries should be within that time  something which has not currently been happening. I have used Tesco deliveries for the past 7 years and the only time  up until the past few months that I had a problem with delivery was when the delivery was cancelled due to snow  which is obviously not your fault. I am getting fed up with having to make sure I am available for 2 hours around my 1 hour time slot. I get the deliveries for convenience but having to wait around for an extra hour is not convenient at all. As I stated on the contact form I filled out  I would like this to be looked into. I am seriously considering not renewing my delivery saver with you next year as since I have had it the deliveries have been terrible.					2016-11-20T11:24:56+0000	1479641096	2016-11-20 12:24:56	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went for breakfast this morning along with my 9 year old son. I asked for a small bowl for my sons cereal which I brought along myself as he doesn t eat what you have available. I was told he could not eat his own food  after explaining why he doesn t eat and why I have his own food. I was then handed a bowl and small amount of milk (just enough to make a cup of tea) and was charged £11.45! £11.45 for one breakfast  2 soft drinks and a dash of milk. I was charged £1.50 for a dash of milk  I don t normally complain about having to pay for milk as I understand restaurants have a policy on bring in your own food but I was charged £1.50 for a  glass (of) milk  yet only got a little. If I had a 8 month old baby with me and had brought a jar of food I would not have been told he/she could not eat it  so why say no to an older child after I ve explained? My son was very upset and kept asking why he was  not allowed to eat his own food yet all the other boys and girls were allowed to eat because they were alright with the food here .	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15095438_10207655178528735_4391419222502409816_n.jpg?oh=48e55fec33032b4026ad2fc5f33a9912&oe=5924ADD0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15095438_10207655178528735_4391419222502409816_n.jpg?oh=13fdbff940d3f672349dbdf1a8227188&oe=58E3C1DD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207655178528735&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-20T10:52:07+0000	1479639127	2016-11-20 11:52:07	0	6	0	0	6	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She was bought paw patrol mashems from your store on the Isle of Wight by her grandparents. This made her very happy  she was even more happy when one of these was Sky! My super pleased daughter played with these for less than 24 hours before Sky  upon being lovingly hugged  gently   burst in my daughters face. As you can imagine my happy daughter them become a grumpy devastated monster (I much prefer a happy daughter) normally this could be solved with cake  chocolate  another toy or a trip to the cinema. But my daughter is currently being assessed for ASD  she is also highly anxious and she is struggling to get over the fact that Sky  her beloved new pet  burst in her face  covering her eyes  mouth and fluffy jumper with liquid. (I certainly hope the liquid is just water) she is now terrified of touching the other mashems in case they do the same to her. So Tesco  to save me having to make a trip all the way back to your store just to exchange a mashem  (my other daughter has bronchitis so would rather not make her leave the house) which she is now scared of and would be even more upset if she didn t get sky  can you help to make my daughter happy again. Please see attached evidence of unhappy daughter  I am happy to send a picture of a receipt and the mashems.

Shame on you Tesco  double standards.   You also gave different reasons to the same question asked by different people.   I m boycotting your stores until you restore my faith. Which quite frankly is unlikely given your attitude on a previous post about this.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15027368_10154774498343593_3033883415071216679_n.jpg?oh=b6086016a915d9c7ffcf0a926ee49798&oe=5923B0BF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15027368_10154774498343593_3033883415071216679_n.jpg?oh=86b9504156e2ce9edd7c99cf77d08ae3&oe=58E87EB2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154774498343593&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-20T09:11:11+0000	1479633071	2016-11-20 10:11:11	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having your security guards abuse heavily pregnant women  calling them stupid fat slags is definitely a risky strategy  although I think  as a marketing campaign it may fall flat. I would suggest you review your cctv  in that particular store  between the hours of 9:30 and 11pm on 17/11/2016. I would also suggest mr fisher be brought up on disciplinary charges and summarily dismissed on grounds of gross misconduct  then you may contact me ( the partner of said  slag  and father of her unborn child) to discuss how you would like to avoid the civil and criminal suits I intend on bringing against you .

I was so embarrassed but they completely took over getting her new clothes to put on at no cost water for her and cleaned up the mess them selves.. I offered but they wouldn t let me  instead they was more concerned cleaning my shoes and my daughter up! They made the whole embarrassing and upsetting moment so much easier to deal with never known service like it anywhere!! I will be going in to personally thank them once she is better but TESCOS you should be super proud of the staff at his store and they deserve to be praised for this well done :)					2016-11-19T23:48:12+0000	1479599292	2016-11-20 00:48:12	7	1	7	0	8	1	1	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Was waiting for my shopping tonight  due to be delivered between 9-10pm  10:30 still nothing  after half an hour on hold I finally get through to the helpline who tell me the driver didn t have time to deliver my order. I had no contact from the store to inform me of this and they also cannot deliver my order until the following evening  24 hours later than I had booked! There is no priority to send out late orders straight away the next day- which is surely common sense and courteous.  I can forgive this happening once but only two months ago an almost identical situation happened with my order- should you be taking these orders if you clearly cannot commit to getting them to customers during the allocated and paid for time slot?  You have now lost a loyal customer  hello sainsburys.					2016-11-19T23:38:53+0000	1479598733	2016-11-20 00:38:53	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

While shopping I noticed someone  either too cheap to pay  or  more likely desperate had stolen sanitary pads. We discussed some stores have nappies in the baby change and they said they would raise it with a supervisor and pop the remaining packet in the toilets. Often difficult for homeless  teens in bad situations  or even worse  I thought this was a positive move on a difficult subject  well done.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15055786_10154220987717956_3044768748017027873_n.jpg?oh=8eb757eab1291656b2b9c9192bb55f42&oe=58DC580D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15055786_10154220987717956_3044768748017027873_n.jpg?oh=fcd4378eed428939e34ca51c684b3608&oe=591B0200	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154220987717956&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-19T21:17:56+0000	1479590276	2016-11-19 22:17:56	9	5	9	0	14	4	3	1	2	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

Monday maybe ?					2016-11-19T17:52:47+0000	1479577967	2016-11-19 18:52:47	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Masses of space still allotted to the premium brands though!! And they ve put all their own brand drinks on the top shelf which means short arses like me can t reach the blinking things when stocks are running low and I have to ask someone taller to help me which is mortifying!  They appear to no longer be stocking the 2 litre bottles of own brand cola xero or cherry cola xero at all. Couldn t find anyone in store today to ask if this was really the case  the guy restocking the wine an aisle over told me it wasn t his department and he had no idea what was going on. My teenagers don t get many fizzy drinks  but they got a bottle of each on shopping day to last them the week and in the 2 for 90p deal it didn t break the bank. However 2 for £2 for 1.75l bottles of the premium brand  Coke  means their cola treat is now off the shopping list. Have substituted the cola for orange xero and lemon and lime xero this week  but they re not happy kids.					2016-11-19T17:41:41+0000	1479577301	2016-11-19 18:41:41	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The other two were the new nutella ones  they were stale and one didn t even have any filling in it. Shocking really when we spent £4.85 for the 3. Such a massive let down as the advert we saw about the nutella doughnuts look amazing. The reality is way way off. Stale  no filling  not good enough.					2016-11-19T17:02:14+0000	1479574934	2016-11-19 18:02:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Told would be coming Sunday-money had already been taken. Then told today unless we pay again shopping won t be delivered! We ask when first money will be back in bank as can t afford to pay twice. You say 5 days and we say we can t do that- Tesco say basically tough. Tesco say they ll give us £30 vouchers and when we say to manager Karen this isn t exactly helping as we cannot pay £120 for shopping she says fine I ll cancel them then!!!!!!!! Gobsmacked isn t the word!! She tells me tough  ring your bank and they ll refund quicker. We phone bank  they don t do this. Karen then calls us liars and threatens to cancel online coupons.

The incompetency & rudeness of the Ryde Opticians staff is beyond belief   from the truly unhelpful staff to the gormless looking optician with the bedside manner of a cabbage. Today s visit was a horrible experience. Only they know how to make the person who is in the right feel like they re wrong to complain about the poor service. It s not the first time I ve been dissatisfied with the customer service there but it will certainly be the last. I hear Specsavers in the town is very friendly so they ll be getting my family s custom from now on.

I have sent them back with the driver as at least half of each box are extremely brown   I appreciate that 100% is not possible but since the grapes are in date by at least three days and are one of the few things I can reliably stomach this is extremely inconvenient. I understand that the pickers in store are busy but a little more attention would make my life a lot easier as I carnt easily get to a store myself.					2016-11-19T15:03:12+0000	1479567792	2016-11-19 16:03:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I paid for these and then realised I was charged for all 3.. I called customer services and was told that one of the items was going to be supplied by a 3rd party therefore you don t get 3 for 2.. - apparently this is on the small print on your website.. but it s not at all clear.. I have paid Tescos for all three products.. this is very misleading advertising..					2016-11-19T14:34:08+0000	1479566048	2016-11-19 15:34:08	5	6	5	1	12	6	5	1	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I rang to discuss my policy renewal  advise of changes  and get my policy total recalculated. This turned out to be double other quotes I had received; so I asked that my policy does not get renewed and I receive an email to confirm this. She asked if there were any other changes that would need to be made (to which I replied there wasn t)  I had no other questions  and that was that. After still not receiving an email  I decided it was not a  could take 48hrs  type of email and called back today. I was advised by a (quite helpful) man that my policy WAS going to renew  AND that there was an outstanding balance on my account due to the policy changes!! No  outstanding charges  had been previously mentioned to me. Thanks to the guy today  I have now received confirmation that my policy will not lapse and he is going to get the call listened to which will prove the incompetence of the colleague I spoke to on Wednesday.  If I hadn t have called today  who would have advised me that I had an outstanding balance AND that my policy was in fact going to renew against my wishes?! (Which was £1098!!!!)  Whenever I told anyone I was with Tesco insurance  I heard nothing but  horror stories  about the abysmal service it provides and how they scam customers. I guess now i m another name on that list!!  First and last time I ever get insured with Tesco!!!! 😡					2016-11-19T14:14:41+0000	1479564881	2016-11-19 15:14:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I found a few things I wanted (one was the last in stock) and I wanted the paw patrol air patroller  the nice lady checked the stock and what was due in on delivery and told me if I was to buy something for the same price I would be able to bring it back today and change it for what I wanted  brilliant!! So I go back to the store today to find none have been delivered and another lady telling me they can t guarantee what stock would be delivered. So now I m stuck with a toy I don t want and no paw patrol air patroller. I wouldn t of bothered had the first lady (and someone from customer services) told me I may not be able to get it.					2016-11-19T14:00:17+0000	1479564017	2016-11-19 15:00:17	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will  never ever shop in tesco again..my daughter is type 1 diabetic  has ulcerated feet with gangrene set in... all  this stress has raised my blood pressure to a dangerous high...it s not tesco fault my daughter I ll but I should not still be waiting for  refund because they forgot to  start the  process... please ignore the  rambling I am simply  so angry I can t text write quick enough			http://tesco.com/	tesco.com	2016-11-19T13:27:39+0000	1479562059	2016-11-19 14:27:39	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Let me tell you a story about one of your customers (soon to be ex customer along with my husband and daughter).  I started a new job u see  so I thought  I am going to treat myself to a new phone. So I paid off my contract handset  and bought myself a nice shiny new Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. In beautiful Rose gold. I was so chuffed! Well  after shelling out over £700 on my handset and paying off my old handset  i was pretty chuffed with myself. Well imagine my disappointment when just 3 weeks (nearly 4) later I decide to get insurance on my phone  to be told by tesco I can t buy said policy. I asked for a copy of my receipt as mine had got damaged slightly in the rain  to be told flatly  no  incase I am  trying to fiddle tesco . Well I can assure you that I am not trying to fiddle you  just trying to protect my phone. To add insult to injury  the case that I Bought from your store also broke my phone slipped out of it and guess what?.........I have a smashed screen that I am not insured for! Who would have thought? Well I have decided that I have thrown enough money at tesco now  and I will take my custom elsewhere. I am disgusted. You sell shoddy goods and your staff are  simply put  Rude.  Oh and that job I got.......Yeah  I work for O2. The company that provides YOUR net work services. Hmm.........think I ll be letting people know what poor service is being associated with their name.  I hope to hear from you soon before I seek further advice.					2016-11-19T10:34:57+0000	1479551697	2016-11-19 11:34:57	2	8	3	0	11	8	5	3	0	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0

A special mention to Andy (online services manager). Decided to change my grocery delivery to a pick up and it was too late to amend on line. Went into store and Andy couldn t have been more helpful in arranging this and texting us to let my husband know when it was ready. He even popped a complimentary bottle of vino in our shopping even tho it was him helping us out. Customer service at its best. Thanks Andy.

I managed to take a picture before he removed the price tag. Sort it out!! 					2016-11-18T22:41:41+0000	1479508901	2016-11-18 23:41:41	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I totally forgot about it so when I heard the door I thought it was my mate bringing something so answered it dead casually holding my six week old daughter to find a guy stood there holding crates of my shopping  I panicked and said  umm one minute   and his response was  don t worry I ll bring it all in for you   would you like them in your kitchen? .  Then asked how old my daughter was and told us about him becoming an uncle.  Lovely lad.  😊. #tescorocks					2016-11-18T22:25:15+0000	1479507915	2016-11-18 23:25:15	1	4	2	1	7	4	2	2	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

I reported it to a member of staff that was on duty  but he appeared completely clueless as to what to do. I suggested he may want to go and check the CCTV  but I saw him a few seconds later looking at the DVD display. How he could tell if someone had taken one  I don t know. Maybe you should send someone down there to check it out.  Store 2521.					2016-11-18T22:11:09+0000	1479507069	2016-11-18 23:11:09	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is less common to note the good service of particular staff members. I feel it is time to do this. I live very near to the small Tesco on Myrtle Parade in Liverpool  (near the university).   I have to say i don t like the shop because my ethical stance is very strongly against self service tills. Most people in Liverpool will know what machine one is describing if the term  job killer  is used. I often find the shop over crowded and don t like having to wait in a queue for a long time because of understaffing if the option is to use one of those things. I could complain about problems or sometimes other members of staff there and regularly walk past the shop several blocks to use the Co-Op.   Having said that you have at least one excellent staff member and I think it is worth Tesco noting this. I read her name badge and she is called Alison. She has consistently been welcoming  good-humoured and friendly. She is efficient and serves quickly and tonight while serving I noticed her genuinely listening to the customer in front of me. (I don t now her in case you think I am one of her friends but) I just think good staff should be commended or even promoted if possible. I thnk I as a customer would be more likely to regularly use the shop with more influence from staff like her.  I just thought it was important to give some positive feedback  and as a company you need more staff like her.					2016-11-18T22:02:48+0000	1479506568	2016-11-18 23:02:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But Tesco deem it necessary to charge £73!!! It s not enough that we ve paid you monthly  and never claimed  not even for a windscreen!

He was sat in a seat of a trolley for disabled use but she kept having to push him back into the seat as the seat was so big as the trolley is ment for adults and he kept sliding down. She obviously couldn t put him in his small wheelchair and try and push a shopping trolley at the same time.  As your such a big supermarket would it be possible to make and have avaliable for use in all stores a trolley that is suitable for disabled children? Every little helps and all that!

Chose today as I would be home. Attempted delivery to wrong address at 6.25pm. Can t ring dpd. Tesco customer services suggest I go to depot and pick it up tomorow. I have no way to get there. And why should I? The order was for my son and required for Sunday. Told they woukd speak to dpd and ring me back. No return phone call. I will now have to purchase an alternative and would like a refund. No point at all being told it will be delivered Monday. The same dpd driver had delivered a different tesco order to me at lunchtime and when I asked if there was another parcel was told no online tracking said otherwise!					2016-11-18T20:52:40+0000	1479502360	2016-11-18 21:52:40	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I only ever shop with you but am very upset about my purchase today! Amongst my weekly shop I got a bottle of Fanta as I was a bit thirsty! On opening the bottle I thought it tasted a bit flat and after looking at the Best before it says it was out of date in June 2016. Nearly 6 months out of date!!!  Now being 8 months pregnant this was a bit of a worry to me as I could of potentially drank something that could of been harmful to myself and my unborn baby! I thank god it was best before and not use by!

Today  however  I am mortified. It s my daughter s 18th birthday on Tuesday so I ordered the Rainbow celebration cake as it s for her party and it says that it serves 16.  I d just like to ask if this is meant to be 16 adult humans or a family of 16 Borrowers !! It is the smallest thing I have ever seen and you have the audacity to charge £10 for it  there is no way you should be selling that cake for 16 people at that price. I am so disappointed.

You failed to deliver my shopping on Saturday 5th of November 9-10pm. I had a call from your driver at 8.50 saying no one was in (before my allocated slot) Tried to call back between 8.55-9.15 several times  no reply. It was all the shopping my sons birthday party the next day. Had to do a mad rush in the morning to my local waitrose (which may I add was £4 cheaper for a pretty identical trolley from yourselves!) so I had something to feed 40 hungry 7 year olds. Still no reason given by yourselves or refund. The driver marked it as delivered which is wasn t. God know where my food went  probably in the pub with your driver I suspect. Appalling you haven t resolved this by now. Please can I get a full refund. Clearly will not now be relying on your delivery service for special occasions.					2016-11-18T19:32:47+0000	1479497567	2016-11-18 20:32:47	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received my Tesco delivery last night when unpacking my shopping well i mean before carrying it up the stairs as I live in an upstairs flat I noticed that a bottle of bleach had been leaking and was all over my hands work pants and my carpet runner at the bottom of my stairs. Meanwhile my 3 year son was helping me with the shopping as he does every week which the tesco delivery man witnessed . I called straight away to explain the situation. The bleach had been placed upside down in a bag than did not have handles and hadn t been tied at the top. I was refunded some of my chilled items where thr spilage had went into and sent an a voucher for £5 for the inconvenience.£5 I think that s an absolute insult I ve had to go out today and replace the goods. Whole idea of doing online shopping is that s it s more convenient to me . I was advised a manager would call me back today as the guy I spoke with last night couldn t get through to the team needed but was promised a call today. So 6pm this evening still no call so I have telephoned myself to me told my details hadnt been passed on and all the managers  and all the managers had finished at 4pm.

I ordered some glasses via click and collect for next day. Once I opened the box I found one of the glasses were broken. Straight away I informed customer services over email who offered a replacement or £5 off the order. I replied immediately asking for a replacement  as I needed all the glasses  and I have heard nothing over the last few days. I ordered the glasses in plenty of time  wanting to use them over the weekend and I m disappointed with the way my complaint has been handled  hence deciding to try and contact you through different means.					2016-11-18T18:42:01+0000	1479494521	2016-11-18 19:42:01	0	10	0	0	10	10	2	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received my weekly shopping last night (via delivery) the contents of a bottle of bleach had leaked onto my food shopping whilst covering my work pants and carpet where the delivery trays had been placed. Meanwhile my three year old son was helping me with the shopping as he loves to help each week luckily it was me that waa covered and not him .I telephoned straight away to complain. The bleach had been out in a bag upside down the bag used didn t even have handles. I was refunded some of my shopping and sent an evoucher for  the value of £5.00 what an absolute joke!!!I was then told a manager would call me back today as no managers where available to speak with me last night. By 6pm I hadn t received a phone call so ive called back to speak with someone to be told my complaint hadnt been passed over and all of the managers had left for the day at 4pm. Is this what you call good customer service ? Lack of communication amongst staff and false promises. Now to be told a manager should call me back tomorrow ..... this is not on the customer experience is shocking and I will be taking this further .					2016-11-18T18:31:51+0000	1479493911	2016-11-18 19:31:51	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Absolutely disgusted with the service that has been provided  my recommendation to all who buy from a Tesco is make sure that it s not a 3rd party that they are using to sell you your goods  because Tesco are no help after they have had there cut.					2016-11-18T18:10:36+0000	1479492636	2016-11-18 19:10:36	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You see I ve lived in Ely for just over a year now and absolutely love my local Tesco. The staff are amazing and remembered myself and my children from our first visit. They always say hello as we pass though the store and ask us how we have been since our last visit (which is usually only a day or less!)  they remember little details about the girls and always talk to them. On short  they just go that extra mile.  Christmas is coming and our Tesco is looking bland! In a world of crazy shoppers who sometimes feel they don t have time for smiles or thank you s  your staff still manage to stay positive and happy.  Tesco  id love it if you could do something nice for them. Please give our store a Christmas hat  so they can see it on their way to work and know that the people of Ely really do appreciate them and make their daunting shifts ahead not seem so!  Sincerely  a very grateful resident of Ely!					2016-11-18T17:27:15+0000	1479490035	2016-11-18 18:27:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is now common since the opening hours have been cut. However is did show the disgusting states of the shelves obviously not been cleaned in years. The picture is of one shelf could have taken 40 pictures. You need to get them cleaned it is not  for a food store.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15135771_10153907040041671_9175572993350633271_n.jpg?oh=a6d9088d73b4f5985c3aa24dd5839fa7&oe=5921BB09	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15135771_10153907040041671_9175572993350633271_n.jpg?oh=5842a5fbc62b78b897d5dfb6fe32297a&oe=58DB8204	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153907040041671&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-18T16:47:46+0000	1479487666	2016-11-18 17:47:46	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After shopping in Chester I went to a small Tesco and bought a meal deal to eat when I got home. When I arrived home in northwich I took one bite of my sandwich to find it tasted disgusting and after looking at the packet was 2 days out of date. I took the sandwich into the northwich Tesco down the road and spoke to a lady on customer services. The lady was in a Nike jumper obviously none uniform  who make no eye contact  was just staring at the sandwich to tell me that as it was there stock (Chester store) there wasn t a lot she could do. I told her this could have made me ill. I also had bought my weekly shop on Tuesday from the northwich store and the pictures show my banana and my orange the day after. She asked what I wanted to do  I replied that obviously I hadn t eaten lunch and would like a sandwich. I went and chose another sandwich from the shelf. When I returned I over heard the same lady talking to a gent buying a lottery ticket saying that  they didn t know what was wrong with people at the moment ... I was handed a refund to which I was then told  oh you can just have the sandwich  thanks love  and that was that... I don t feel like there was any real apology in the matter what so ever considering this could have made me sick.

You know how you re now applying a £70 parking charge to anyone who uses a disabled bay without entitlement  or a parent & child space without having a child with them?  Well here s an idea. Those hatched areas at the end of the parking rows - the ones that are kept clear so as to ensure that cars can see if it s safe to pull out? Why don t you apply the £70 parking charge to muppets who park on those who seem to think they have a divine entitlement to park closer to the store than anyone else? You know - the ONLY parking transgression that actually causes real danger to everyone else by stopping them seeing oncoming traffic when they pull out of the parking aisle.  Now there s an idea. Here s two from Horwich Tesco today for you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15027621_10155493798575760_8185406412133234233_n.jpg?oh=72657076a9e07de52f6d85b39cabb291&oe=592334F0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15027621_10155493798575760_8185406412133234233_n.jpg?oh=39574ca6172c0feb29b1b73be55ef884&oe=58D6FAFD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155493798575760&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-18T13:30:52+0000	1479475852	2016-11-18 14:30:52	12	18	12	0	30	18	10	8	9	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0

Called on the 8th of October to book my wife s phone for repairs and after i explained what happened they said I will receive a jiffy bag between 3_ day. Waited and the jiffy bag didn t arrived. Called again after 7 days and same story  wait 3_5 days and so on until last week when they told me that it was delivered  to the wrong address. My question is how can u send the jiffy bag to the wrong address and send the bills to the good one? And by the way  we waited from last week and didn t received the jiffy bag. My wife had to make another contract with another provider so she can have a phone so we can communicate between us and with our family. Do you think that is fare to pay the bills every single month  to respect the contract and from your part to take us like some fools?

Surely if the product is out off stock with Tesco direct the labeling should be rectified and customers orders should be honoured??	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15085715_1796833743917245_4043141781079010951_n.jpg?oh=ea13c581e66e7d30c9e52d9215689b18&oe=58DD068A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15085715_1796833743917245_4043141781079010951_n.jpg?oh=cd684f396499e1bc6a03ca64971de417&oe=5924369F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1796833743917245&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-18T12:37:49+0000	1479472669	2016-11-18 13:37:49	4	12	6	2	20	12	6	6	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	2	0

Well that said whilst shopping in your Braintree town store today my 3 year old son  along with a 2 year old who was with a friend of mine enjoyed an apple as she was paying  we were then followed out of store and stood in the entrance in front of many and my 3 year old and I were questioned as to where the apple came from  we instantly told the security tesco staff member it was from the crate clearly stated help your self to free fruit while you shop  my answer clearly wasn t good enough and I was told another customer has complained my son had stolen fruit  made to feel like we were lying I told the gentleman I would happily walk with him show him where and he would clearly be able to see (as it had just been stocked) 2 juicy apples missing one my son had and one his friend had  the gentleman still not believing us and choosing to believe someone who must have not read the sign  not only did he embarrass myself but my 3 year old too. Who now will not eat the apple as he was made to feel  naughty   I m shocked by the way we were treated  why give out free fruit to children if you then belittle them and their parents  in front of the store:   It s safe to say we won t be taking tesco up on any free fruit while we shop  if we choose to shop there again. I will now explain to my son that he did nothing what so ever wrong.   Thanks tesco Braintree					2016-11-18T11:56:25+0000	1479470185	2016-11-18 12:56:25	1	16	3	1	20	16	14	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0

We did a click and collect order my partner came to collect our order we were running early we received a text saying we could collect early if we wanted which saved us waiting around. Unfortunately when we cot there one crate out of seven was missing. There was a queue behind so he said he would look into it and get it refunded. An hour later we received a phone call he was on his way to our property to deliver I don t know if this is what you do or it was off his back but this was great service!! Ever week that mans been there and he s been helpful and kind! Just wanted this to get back to him. He is a asset to your company and makes the shopping experience hassle free and easy! Thank you Tesco.					2016-11-17T22:57:55+0000	1479423475	2016-11-17 23:57:55	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A few days ago I purchased some Chicken from one of your Tesco Local stores ready for a  pick me up  Fajita night and tonight when I came to cook the chicken off I found it was tremendously fatty and grizzly.

Could you tell my why you ve decided to double the price of your Carousel Train Table Set in the last 24 hours please? I ve had my eye on it for a while for my youngest son and it s always been £30 with no indication of it being a sale price. Today it s £60!? This is a ridiculous price for a tesco own brand toy!					2016-11-17T21:49:20+0000	1479419360	2016-11-17 22:49:20	3	8	4	0	12	8	5	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	1	0

Can I just say I m absolutely disgusted in respect to how I was treated when I wanted to purchase a coat from you. I had approached your Florence and Fred colleague about a coat which was absolutely filthy from the the floor. (Maybe have a look at your stores cleaning standards to stop issues like this especially being such a  reputable company ) I asked your colleague to check if there was more in stock due to the dirt at the bottom of the coat. She did kindly check for me and offered me 10% off the coat. So I firstly accepted this. When I went to the customer service desk to complete the transaction I was then told that the coat would be none returnable! When my friend questioned why she was ignored by your customer service colleague by the name of  Bev  so then I had to say can you not ignore my friend please  she stated it is what is because we have discounted it. So if anything else had gone wrong with the coat I wouldn t have been able to return it. And all because of how dirty this particular store was?  Bev  wasn t very helpful at all  and I was having my consumer rights penalised due to the state of your stock? How is this acceptable? I was in desperate need of a coat due to circumstances out of my control to then be spoken too and treated like that - again down to the quality of the lack of cleanliness. Absolutely shocking is an understatement. Totally disappointed.					2016-11-17T21:39:55+0000	1479418795	2016-11-17 22:39:55	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No more double up on toys etc. I will now be saving with Park for Christmas 2017  and doing my online shop with asda. I m  aware we could have 4x the value on many things but Christmas saver is just that  saving  for Christmas. My kids won t want driving lessons or tops tiles from Santa.					2016-11-17T21:18:52+0000	1479417532	2016-11-17 22:18:52	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A lorry went up in flames on the road outside  & caused mayhem. Customers in the store were looked after & kept notified of what was happening via the tannoy. Once the smoke had cleared & we could go outside again  it took the car park a while to clear. I had my one year old daughter with me  & two men from click & collect came over to make sure we were ok & had everything we needed. They went out of their way to help  telling me to come & press the button outside if there was anything they could do for us. Customer service at its best 😊 thanks 😊					2016-11-17T20:48:14+0000	1479415694	2016-11-17 21:48:14	92	7	93	7	107	7	5	2	3	0	92	1	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a cot mattress in October which arrived 2 days early. It s was left in my garden and had rips in the plastic. There were dirty marks on the mattress so I emailed my complaint. An exchange was supposed to happen days later but the driver did not turn up when they said. I ve been emailing back and forth trying to resolve this only to be told my best option is to just return it to a tesco store. So I have to cart this mattress down to tesco nearly 7 months pregnant just to get my money back!					2016-11-17T19:33:00+0000	1479411180	2016-11-17 20:33:00	2	17	6	0	23	17	4	13	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	4	0

I love your coleslaw  I really do but if I have to dry clean one more handbag  or my shoes from  carrier bag seepage  then I will send you the bill. You re making me skint.   Surely it s not that hard to package your products accordingly?   I think the fact you charge £4 for one layer of cheap  Christmas  biscuits and charge an additional £1 for a packet of cigarettes compared to other shops  that you would have enough money to seal other goods that leak.   Just a suggestion.  I don t like wet feet unless I m in the bath.  Thank you   Sophie					2016-11-17T18:56:14+0000	1479408974	2016-11-17 19:56:14	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a long standing customer I highly suggest that a  cat proof  aisle would be loved by man. Here are a couple of pictures to argue my case.   Please could you tell me if you stock the white plant pots that these lovely succulents once lived in at one of your Norwich branches - my ocd may just spiral out of control and I blame yourselves for not having bounce proof pots.

After looking around the store we couldn t find anything suitable  so we asked a member of staff called Tony Bailey who said that he would look in the back at the old Halloween stock left over. He took my number and said he would call if he found anything. 2 hours later I received a call saying he had found a few things for me and that he would leave them at customer services.  He went out of his way to help me and I was really impressed with the service I received. I would just like to say a massive thank you to Tony and the rest of the staff at Tesco for helping.  I know my little sister will love her scary bat party now! :)					2016-11-17T18:22:40+0000	1479406960	2016-11-17 19:22:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I telephoned the customer services and they offered me a £35 reduction or a replacement and I opted for the replacement thinking that it would then be the correct colour but when it arrived it was still the wrong colour. I contacted customers once again and then offered £15 reduction when I asked that last time this happened I was offered £35 but the sales member was adamant that this was no longer the case. I feel totally let down by tescos customer services as I all wanted was the correct product. This has put me off shopping with tescos again.					2016-11-17T17:56:18+0000	1479405378	2016-11-17 18:56:18	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Purchased some bagels yesterday at your prescot store. To come to have them now to find the date the 12th. I don t have time to check every date on items I purchase.

The flowers are all dying. When my mum drew attention to this to a member of staff at customer services she was told that  it s because they are reduced . Because the normal-price flowers were in water she didn t seem at all concerned. Even when my mum asked if they could be watered the staff member said no.  It only takes a few seconds to put water in those buckets  and if staff are going to dehydrate the flowers like this then I don t see why they bother even reducing the price. They might as well throw them away immediately because no one is going to want to buy dead flowers.  I am disappointed by Tesco s attitude.					2016-11-17T16:41:20+0000	1479400880	2016-11-17 17:41:20	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A few months ago Tesco Blackburn where kind enough to donate fresh vegetables for our 3 boys to munch on and also some fantastic classroom supplies which included paper  colouring crayons etc. Not forgetting all the biscuits and coffee  tea & sugar. Now they have again kindly donated more vegetables and a number of Selection Boxes for our lucky children to receive off Santa at our fantastic up and coming Christmas Party.   These donations make a big difference to our charity  so thank you.					2016-11-17T15:53:23+0000	1479398003	2016-11-17 16:53:23	0	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

She got tired and grumpy part way around so I got her out for a cuddle  she promptly fell asleep! I then had to carry her soundo and like a deadweight around the rest of the store whilst trying to remember what I needed  all of this pushing a trolley and stopping every 19 steps to readjust her! I walked past several members of staff none of which offered to help me. I had to cut my shopping trip short as my arm was going numb and the visit (apart from being quiet) was not a pleasant one. I headed to the scan as u shop checkouts  where one other customer was  and 2 members of staff were waiting. I struggled to hold my daughter and pay for my shopping and then struggled out of the shop. I always hear lovely stories about customers being helped by kind members of staff...which stores do they work I ? I d love to know as chichester tesco definitely didn t achieve that goal today! Maybe they all work on Saturdays. Although I joke I am EXTREMELY cross and disappointed now and definitely not looking forward to my next shopping trip just my daughter and I.					2016-11-17T13:54:05+0000	1479390845	2016-11-17 14:54:05	1	3	2	2	7	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

I also wonder why you seem to sell the same product packaged in two different jars but maybe I have too much time on my hands.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15094939_10154583143916955_1732371338638168862_n.jpg?oh=7259277fcfab4d004c0eb47a24cc7b98&oe=591D0500	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15094939_10154583143916955_1732371338638168862_n.jpg?oh=13df998eab25508c2e3d2520b9e59661&oe=58E8550D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154583143916955&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-17T13:44:04+0000	1479390244	2016-11-17 14:44:04	4	8	4	0	12	8	2	6	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

You select the goods on the website. You opt for click and collect. The supplier confirms the transaction. Days later you go to the collection-point but leave empty handed. There is no record of your transaction on your account with the trader. But your credit card bill clearly shows the amount has been credited to the trader. Sounds like a dodgy Ebay – perhaps from the far East?  Well. Cheshunt is East of Watford but this is not Ebay. It’s Tesco Direct.  My £18 toaster purchase from Tesco Direct was purchased on a Friday  confirmed on line and the money credited to Tesco on my credit card statement. But five days later my entire purchasing record showed only a lawn mower from some four years before. There was no record of the toaster purchase.  Happily a thirty minute telephone call with a courteous and very helpful Ms Tesco straightened it out.  But the moral is: caveat emptor does not only apply to Ebay. Check your purchase confirmation not just on the Tesco website – but also have you received their email with reference number – and importantly - is your latest purchase recorded in your Tesco account. Saves the buyer and the lovely Ms Tesco a lot of time					2016-11-17T12:08:02+0000	1479384482	2016-11-17 13:08:02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was told by a member of staff that they didn t have any and Tesco s just put that on the website to get people into store and then they will buy other items. I went back to Tesco s at 9.10a.m. and they said they haven t got any and were not expecting any and could not help. Rang Tesco s customer service  and they could not help either. Why put it on the website if it is not true. I have got soaked in the process all because my granddaughter has asked Father Xmas for one and thought it would be my only chance. I am very disappointed in Tesco s for misleading people with this advert online.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15078750_10154268566653402_1352698096522720458_n.jpg?oh=7d6478b90e309ae9ee9a9ad24495661c&oe=58DD5299	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15078750_10154268566653402_1352698096522720458_n.jpg?oh=041a6870f596de94cb3213213e954191&oe=58E85E94	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154268566653402&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-17T10:29:01+0000	1479378541	2016-11-17 11:29:01	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had made a special trip to buy a particular Christmas present for my daughter as it said online you had stock in this store and it is sold out everywhere else  but when I asked Gray he said he hadn t seen this item. I enquired at the click & collect section but received no help there. After continuing with my shopping Gray found me and said he d gone into the store room for something else and seen the item I was looking for so been wandering around the store trying to find me! I was so grateful I very nearly hugged him but decided to compose myself and acknowledge him here instead!

Had an order I placed cancelled and refunded because of error on company s part  whereby my item was sent to wrong store. Instead of dispatching it to correct shop  it was instead cancelled and now not only have I not received my item  but it is now out of stock and not available at discounted price. Customer service then stated that I shouldn t be annoyed as I received a refund due to it being out of stock.  I would therefore like to point out that it wasn t out of stock when you sent it to wrong shop 😣					2016-11-17T00:59:24+0000	1479344364	2016-11-17 01:59:24	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I placed an online order with a flexi slot and was txt saying it would be here between 4-5 was then txt again saying between 4-5.48pm....it got to 8pm and nothing  I rang and was told my order had been cancelled and I wasn t getting it  (which by the way was very convenient seeing as I was waiting on stuff for my 3 kids) I said to the (very unhelpful) member of your customer service team if I hadn t of rang I d still be none the wiser my shopping wasn t coming...her reply  well yeah basically . Anyways I was then told I d been refunded  I d be charged again tomorrow and re delivered....BUT my refund could actually take a week to go back into my account. Well I m a single mum of 3 young children the money I used to pay for my shopping which you took out of my account was the last of my money  so how am I meant to pay for it again tomorrow? I literally have nothing in my kids need to be fed! I was then told the only chance of me getting my shopping without paying for it was a re-drop...which he was 99.9% sure that wouldn t happen (even though I d been offered 3 different delivery times prior) so unless I pay for my shopping again (with no money as I ve used it all on my shopping which I d already paid for) I m not going to get it or my money back for anything up to a week! So firstly can you please explain to me how I m supposed to feed my 3 children for the week? Secondly why wasn t I even informed my shopping delivery wasn t coming? Thirdly why are your staff not taught proper customer service seeing as that s there job? I m totally disgusted with the lack of service I ve received from your company today and I 100% won t be using you again!!					2016-11-16T23:29:06+0000	1479338946	2016-11-17 00:29:06	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At first I thought how could it be  then on further inspection of the wrapper I can see small blood spots/ marks where the little fly has been squshed within the packaging. He s made me feel a little sick and I certainly don t fancy the chocolate anymore  so you ve done me a favour but can t say the same for the fly.

Only for your driver to call me at 9:45 to let me know he is stuck in a traffic jam on Brigg Road  that I have my suspicions about anyway (looked on google maps live and no amber or red routes). That s AFTER I had already rung your call centre to be told they can t get hold of your driver and will have to call me back in 30 mins (I guess when they ve found him)?? THEN... you have the nerve to pack bread that has a best before date of tomorrow?!?! Are we supposed to sit and eat two loaves of bread tonight?? So you refund my bread and my delivery charge  ok? And give me an evoucher of £5 to spend in your store 😂😐 BUT... the evoucher is not printable  has an expiry date  and is only redeemable on my next grocery order 😂😂😂😖 Not happening I m afraid!!

I shall tell you why...  I decided it was time to buy my children bunk beds  upon finding the perfect ones on your site  I got excited & purchased  along with 2 new sets of butterfly bedding & sheets. Now  this is where things took a turn for the worse.  I m not sure whether it was the fact I ordered bunk beds  for TWO children  with TWO sets of bedding & TWO sheets that gave you the overwhelming urge to charge me TWICE... or just an unfortunate mishap. I m sure you can imagine though  this made me somewhat upset. Upon speaking to customer service  I was informed the duplicate charge would be refunded  albeit in TWO working days... ok  something s cannot be helped...  So  let me tell you about my SECOND misfortune with your service. Upon receiving my order  you can imagine my surprise when one of the bedding sheets wasn t there but instead I had received a Scandinavian mouse toy set. Now  I don t know what bed sheets you ve been sleeping in but I m pretty sure it doesn t look like a mouse.   If you want your customers to be as happy pushing their trollies (or online baskets) as this little mouse  I would suggest not charging people twice or sending them random substitutes. One day I hope to be as happy as mummy mouse...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15094458_10157819255795323_1515862475901233332_n.jpg?oh=0ffdd5093f3ff2164c6775a5e481aa91&oe=58DCA320	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15094458_10157819255795323_1515862475901233332_n.jpg?oh=9d1110f148e18f5c9df79ff34abb5059&oe=5918AE2D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157819255795323&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-16T21:39:43+0000	1479332383	2016-11-16 22:39:43	35	26	78	8	112	25	17	8	74	0	35	0	0	43	0	0	0

There were plenty of staff on hand though should I have needed assistance  that was until I went to pay. Five checkouts and not a single one was manned  apart from the cigarette kiosk which was occupied by a  team member  sat down looking like her cat had just died.   Thank God for self checkouts... as a company you d be lost without them. I m so glad you employ someone to stand in front of them shouting at people that the checkouts are all closed and reminding me that I have to scan  bag  pay and wait for my change myself.   Here s a suggestion.  Why don t you just do away with all of the staff and turn Tesco into one enormous vending machine  or  you could just get the customers to order your stock and stack the shelves themselves  that would save you even more money in the long run. You ll be getting Siri to run your Customer Services next.   Meh...					2016-11-16T21:20:26+0000	1479331226	2016-11-16 22:20:26	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

It had a label saying  new recipe   but it was only after I bought it and drank some I realised that meant  now with added artificial sweetner . Thanks Tesco  I know I want to lose weight but I had intended to do this the sensible way and not from being violently ill  as I m allergic to most artificial sweetners! This sugar tax may actually be the death of me!					2016-11-16T21:09:15+0000	1479330555	2016-11-16 22:09:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have found upon eating the value nachos that the ingredients have been suddenly changed. This is however normally of no concern  but I have a small amount of foods that i can eat. Literally it is about 10-15 items  most of which I normally buy from the  free from  section.   These were my one snack that I could eat like having a bag of crisps and didn t cost the earth  plus they saved me on numerous occasions from being doubled over in pain. So not only have I lost something that kept me going I am also laying with my head beside a bucket because corn flour has been added to the nachos.   I know it is not your fault that I can t eat anything else  but is there any way I can get the old ones again. Seriously I have been buying almost 7 packs a week for months. Also it would have been great to have had some sort of notice that they have been changed to prevent me spending most of the day unwell.  Many thanks					2016-11-16T20:43:16+0000	1479328996	2016-11-16 21:43:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These are bought specifically for my 5 year old  only he likes them  so this was very nearly a week out of date dairy product in the tummy on a young child.  I have held off complaining here because we were hoping to receive some customer service from your store but they really don t seem to be taking it very seriously. We were offered a £5 voucher (which would barely cover the cost of coming and replacing the product we now don t have btw) but really money isn t the point  we wanted them to accept that this isn t acceptable and be able to reassure us it wouldn t happen again  not try and fob us off.  We haven t received a great service from Tesco home deliveries in quite a long time and this is just a further loss of confidence in your store and your brand.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15109568_10154748080259704_7371635731236335558_n.jpg?oh=e1e0d60b3097c451e8f379a2b3ee2e3b&oe=58D876D0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15109568_10154748080259704_7371635731236335558_n.jpg?oh=7dad283cb4718e1dc8983c8675252a9c&oe=58D8DADD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154748080259704&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-16T20:36:51+0000	1479328611	2016-11-16 21:36:51	2	8	4	1	13	8	6	2	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	2	0

Firstly  your tubs of fresh mash  the clear film is an absolute nightmare to get off once the mash has been cooked. What s the point of having a tab which should pull off the film when it doesn t come off in one piece and I end up having to put a knife in the film with the risk of burning myself just to get it off. Also I buy your Tesco Finest wafer thin ham and the packaging says peel and seal and my ham packaging never ever sticks back down so I end up wrapping the pack in foil which defeats the object of peel and seal if it doesn t work!					2016-11-16T20:32:41+0000	1479328361	2016-11-16 21:32:41	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There was a person purporting to be from Bath and North East Somerset  council  (aka BANES ) taking notes of customers vehicle registration numbers this afternoon onto a paper form. My understanding is that Tesco own this site- although prior to the store being built the land was used as free parking for over 20 years and the council weren t the owners then and never collected any revenue from it. Surely if you and the local authority are going to collect data in this manner then this should be clearly indicated in store and at the car park entrances.					2016-11-16T20:31:04+0000	1479328264	2016-11-16 21:31:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I saw a female member of your staff along with two males (the female looked like she was a manger) making horrible comments about customer in the store who looked like he may of been from the city s homeless community. He wasn t causing any trouble he simply came in and made a small purchase using the self service tills the female looked like she had followed him around the store and then stood behind him mocking him with colleagues. I stood and watched all this with my daughter in her pram and I felt saddened and disgusted equally.. what a sad and cruel world my daughter will grow up in.

My twin sister and I were inseparable. We did everything together  wore the same clothes  and even ate the same food. Our favourite meal of the year was our Colin the Caterpillar birthday cake - the greatest cake in the world.  We are now 27. Rather  we turned 27 yesterday. We enjoyed the day  but since I was diagnosed with coeliac disease 6 years ago things just haven t been the same. Despite looking high and low every year we have been unable to find a gluten free Colin.  This year  we called the local Tesco store (Aberdeen Danestone) and  to our delight  were told that a gluten free Colin had found its way to the cake shelf. We rushed to the store  but the staff were unable to locate Colin. The stock control systems said that Colin was in the building  but he was nowhere to be seen. Not to be defeated and in desperation  we checked two more stores. Unfortunately we were left disappointed again.  Our birthday was fun  but we thought it was going to be much  much better with Colin celebrating with us. We will try again next year  but are really beginning to lose hope that our future birthdays will ever be as happy as those already passed.  Yours faithfully   Catriona Denham and Siobhan Coulter	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15027516_10153985005355976_3227135696981218220_n.jpg?oh=10bf63ae10a0aa4d8122d1b7c4931fb9&oe=58EB9772	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15027516_10153985005355976_3227135696981218220_n.jpg?oh=ce720969e1c9d4f66769cb7a0c6f6e86&oe=58E8C87F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153985005355976&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-16T20:02:55+0000	1479326575	2016-11-16 21:02:55	73	14	83	3	100	14	13	1	25	0	71	3	0	7	0	0	0

On behalf of all the members of the Royal British Legion s Burnley and Padiham Branch; I d like to say a massive heart felt thanks!  Throughout the week of remembrance staff at your Tesco store in Padiham were incredible  their hospitality shown towards each and every volunteer on a day to day basis was second to none!   Their politeness and sense of respect was outstanding  with the majority of ALL staff of various work levels took their time to show interest in the Legion  the volunteers and most of all Two of the town s remaining War Veterans.  The Royal British Legion is a charity always looking for volunteers  both old and young alike. As days pass  the older folk are getting older  but our younger generation are maturing enough to  what we as a branch like to think  future volunteers to the legion   Allowing us to collect in your store for long days and a touching week is hugely appreciated  I know most stores up and down the country have had  Poppy Stalls  set up but this year in Padiham was unique!  With customers  Staff and the volunteers all contributing to what was described as a  family feel  to this this year s Poppy Appeal!   A massive hand to everyone at the Padiham Store!  Tesco; you ve got yourselves a good bunch there!   #LestWeForget #LiveOn #Tesco	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15109488_10154635501355102_310952404603470594_n.jpg?oh=619cd8d23bc794d7a7cb16bce3abc0bb&oe=591FA395	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15109488_10154635501355102_310952404603470594_n.jpg?oh=270e04b81f4209a7285f02984d1865cc&oe=59246980	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154635501355102&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-16T17:00:54+0000	1479315654	2016-11-16 18:00:54	10	1	10	2	13	1	1	0	1	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

To spend less time in store  I thought it would be a good idea to use your self service machines. When I started using it  there was an issue which required a staff member. I was surprised to see there was only one person aiding customers at the machines at what was a pretty busy period of the day. Because they were occupied  I attracted the attention of someone walking past which they acknowledged but did nothing else. The lady in question kept walking and informed the other lady who was assisting that I needed help. I found this to be unhelpful and wasting of time. When I finally assisted  the lady called on another colleague because there was an issue with the coin bins. After waiting for this to be resolved  I was taken to a till to be served a person. What should have taken 15 mins at the most lasted close to half an hour. It meant that i was delayed on what I planed to do afterwards and also meant I was able to get petrol before leaving.					2016-11-16T16:41:26+0000	1479314486	2016-11-16 17:41:26	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

On 27th October my son was born at 32 weeks. I went to the Tesco Extra with a list of essentials I needed for the new arrival and one of your staff  Billie  helped me get everything that I needed and it transpired that she too had had a baby at 32 weeks. I think she could see that I was a bit out of my depth and was more than happy to help.  Anyway  a week later I was down at Tesco again and I saw Billie and she asked me how my son was doing. I told her that everything with him (Sonny) was going brilliantly and he was getting stronger and bigger by the day but I explained that 7 days after the birth of my son my partner had suffered a massive heart attack. We talked for 5 minutes and she said how sorry she was and she wished both my son and partner all the best.   As I was heading out of the door she ran up behind and said she wanted to do something special for my other half and our new son. A few days later I went back in store and she and her staff had put together a big hamper full of baby and Mother related items such as beauty products  cards  baby clothes  candles  and stationary for our other two boys.   I think what Billie did goes above and beyond her call of duty and should be recognised for her generosity. These are the kind of people you need working for you...these are the kind of people the world needs more of. Keep up the amazing work Billie   Many thanks   Kris	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15055697_10211897632055304_2399293817393884835_n.jpg?oh=abe710d1631bbe2af1c845b11b8b3e8c&oe=58ECF619	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15055697_10211897632055304_2399293817393884835_n.jpg?oh=a8af1a62fe2983bc859ea1e85fd5ea20&oe=58E60214	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211897632055304&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-16T13:47:42+0000	1479304062	2016-11-16 14:47:42	7314	235	8466	465	9166	220	173	47	1637	0	7245	1067	71	1	0	0	0

Unfortunately what you re not telling consumers is that it an OFFSET brand Guarantee.  So when you claim to you re customers  We will price match your branded shop  this is false.... I have just done a small shop and pointed out that my casserole mix is half the price in Sainsbury s / Morrisons / Asda you would not refund the difference because you offset the other Branded prices !!!!!!!!!

The lovely stuffed crust pizzas seem to have been replaced with a new line of nasty  cheap  bog standard pizzas  and a range of pizzas so large that they don t fit in the oven. I ve just had to go to Morrison s to get my pizzas instead. Not that I expect Tesco cares about losing out on £12 once a week.  Talking of Morrison s... are you in some sort of race to the bottom with them to take the title of  most bizarre store layout ? Canned beans and tomatoes belong with canned vegetables. Moving them to a different aisle is helping no one. I expect this was the product of the same  genius  at head office who decided to remove bags of hallowe en sweets from display before the end of hallowe en and replace them with Christmas tubs?  I await being told you  appreciate my frustration  with bated breath...					2016-11-16T12:51:43+0000	1479300703	2016-11-16 13:51:43	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited your Stranraer store on Saturday morning for my weekly shop and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement  Unfortunately for me I am on of  those  people that have been diagnosed with celiac disease. Not a fad dieter or anything but fully diagnosed. So when I went to your  free from  frozen section and I am using the term free from very loosely here because in with the so called gluten free section was the quorn meat free and vegetarian foods which are definitely not free from but packed with things like WHEAT so after a good rummage around my grand choice of selection was a margarita pizza  strawberry cones  fish fingers or chicken nuggets. So after picking the pizza I then went to the  free from  section in the Isle for a pack of rolls to go with my bacon.... No rolls 2 types of bread and an absolute ton of cakes and biscuits. Since the store renovation the selection has went down hill. So I abandoned my basket and went to morrisons and spent 90 quid on my weekly shop. Your loss tesco  iwpild suggest sorting your freezer section out before someone buys something that isn t actually free from and ends up ill......and maybe provide more of a selection like I dunno maybe morrisons or asda!					2016-11-16T12:38:44+0000	1479299924	2016-11-16 13:38:44	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please see below of the Tomato & Mozzarella Pasta Bake  it has hardly any Mozzarella in the package as the  serving suggestion  shows there s lots of it and from the original recipe I ve had before.  Also from the Macaroni Cheese I had last week  it tasted completely different than the original recipe as updated as well.  Please change it back so other people can enjoy the lovely taste you provided before.

(Spend £40/50 and get £5 off). I am a single person I don t spend that much on my shopping I used to when my children lived at home but they have grown up.So basically Tesco is penalising me and thousands of single people with these promotions  You know what our usual spend is so encourage us to spend just a little bit more with more realistic offers or lose us to other retailers					2016-11-16T11:47:56+0000	1479296876	2016-11-16 12:47:56	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m not writing to complain  just to ask a question about your marble cake  why has it changed? I was a big lover of the old marble cake  had been for a long time (years) and it was amazing  it s something my grandma always gives me when I see her (she used to work for your company in the old days and still shops there now  dedication for you) so it s kind of special too (bit sad I know haha). I just wondered what was wrong with it to change it to one that is nowhere near as good  I have tried it numerous times now and it just doesn t come to the standard of the old one 🙁.   Looking forward to your reply   Vicky - marble cake lover!					2016-11-16T11:33:36+0000	1479296016	2016-11-16 12:33:36	2	6	2	0	8	6	1	5	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Being on a budget i always looked forward to my Christmas saver double vouchers to help with Christmas  but now I m struggling. I honestly can t believe people didn t want the double vouchers. I never found it difficult to understand and i m sure many other people didn t  to  so making it easier doesn t seem a fair reason for stopping them. There must be other family s who relied on the double voucher scheme.  Another reason to shop less with you.					2016-11-16T07:47:49+0000	1479282469	2016-11-16 08:47:49	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Is that right you ve ended doubling up points now? I cannot believe after  customer feedback  you feel it more worthwhile to run offers throughout the year instead of certain times of the year.  With the current climate and many families struggling at Christmas it was a great help to be able to double up points and use them on toys and food. What a shame your  market research  shows this not to be popular. I wish you had made it a bit more public you were going to do this as I wouldn t have saved mine for Christmas!   	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQA5FUOqTqbMwncn&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.tesco.com%2Fclubcard%2Fboost%2FCMSAssets%2FUK%2Frewards%2Fdefault%2Fimg%2Fboost-at-tesco%2Fboost-at-tesco-hero-title-15-44.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQB29Q9zyMqofls0	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAGC4Tl8Q7dGreP&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.tesco.com%2Fclubcard%2Fboost%2FCMSAssets%2FUK%2Frewards%2Fdefault%2Fimg%2Fboost-at-tesco%2Fboost-at-tesco-hero-title-15-44.jpg&_nc_hash=AQBh8oCGGqRNCyzT	https://secure.tesco.com/clubcard/boost/boost-at-tesco/4294967293.cat	secure.tesco.com	2016-11-16T05:12:31+0000	1479273151	2016-11-16 06:12:31	1	9	2	0	11	9	3	6	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Really.. no alternative to Cookies in the entire store?  When i asked about it  i was told the Bakery do the picking for their own items (Wellington/Arleston store  picking done in store by dotcom pickers) and if the dotcom picker doesn t have time to go find an alternative (ie go back on the shop floor to find something) they don t bother.   How exactly is this good customer service? Cookies are Cookies are Cookies. If the Bakery don t have any of their own  how is it acceptable for no alternative to be offered when there are about 15 other varieties of cookies down the biscuit aisle?					2016-11-15T23:40:23+0000	1479253223	2016-11-16 00:40:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This for us is a 40 + mile round trip. Knew it was risky as can t ring to check stock according to the tel no when I tried it initially  but chanced anyway. However  when he arrived he couldn t see any on the shelf so asked a member of staff. They told him there may be some in the warehouse but they were unable to check stock levels because there is nobody on customer services after 10pm. I can t understand why the store is open for another 2 hours without at least one person there who could have checked this for us  especially after such a journey. Feeling really disappointed. Would ve felt better to know definitely none there  rather than knowing we may have been so close but let down by your staff 😔😔					2016-11-15T23:27:25+0000	1479252445	2016-11-16 00:27:25	0	9	0	0	9	9	2	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Take for example a delivery received on Sunday 13th Nov. In the order was a full chicken and a pack of salmon amongst other items. Both things expired on 13th Nov. This was not noticed until today (15th) when we got one out to cook. We will not be eating either now. Last week was a similar case with a pack of bread rolls  expiring on the same day. We find it hard to believe these are the freshest items in store !

Whilst shopping at my local tesco in Rochdale at around 7pm today I was looking everywhere for a certain drink I was after called shloer but it was no where to be seen.. After around 10 minutes I noticed it on the very top of your shelves. I was unable to reach it. So I asked one of your employees who s response was  I m busy at the moment what isle are you on and I ll send someone over ... I gave her the isle number 23 and waited for someone to appear. A few moment year one of your employees appeared (I think his name was Anthony). I asked him if he could please get me 4 bottles  off the top shelve for me. He started at me for a moment and appeared to be slightly confused until he asked me something which I did not understand  so he asked me again (which bottles would you like as there is more than one flavour) to whomever is reading this may think  how could you not understand that?  Well.. the gentleman I spoke to had a speech impediment and Down s syndrome and struggled to put his words together but not once did he get upset or angry with me asking him to repeats himself. He smiles at me and grabbed me the 4 bottles that I was after. I kindly thanked him and his response was  no Thankyou for being patient with me and understanding  my Heart melted.. This may not mean anything to you as a reader but to me this gentleman deserves some credit and deserves to be acknowledged. Thankyou Anthony for all your help and assistance and don t every put yourself down!

I just wanted to let you know about an amazing employee in your store in Bletchley.  His name is Barry and he makes my 89 year old grandma s day every Sunday by coming to speak to her  being kind  and making her feel special.

I got there and it was freezing and raining and I m heavily pregnant (due in 2 weeks). The gentleman who was there to greet me was absolutely LOVELY! He told me to open my boot at stay in the car with my son in the warm and he would pack it for me. He was so kind and never let me lift a finger. His name was Gordon. And it was yesterday (mon 15th). I d love for him to get a little acknowledgement from management for his brilliant customer service! He certainly started my morning off to be a positive one. What a lovely man.					2016-11-15T19:00:39+0000	1479236439	2016-11-15 20:00:39	714	42	732	54	828	42	33	9	59	0	708	18	0	0	0	0	0

I didn t realise I would be put through to a central call centre  however the girl on the phone assured me she could help.  I told her the brand name of the product more than 3 times and she didn t understand. I spelled it phonetically twice and described it to her then she eventually found it. She said  sorry it must be the language barrier  I m Scottish  I speak English she was English  I could understand her ok. Language barrier??? I don t think so!

I was pondering what to have for tea tonight....Then I thought  Oh Enchiladas sound good not had them for a long time  Visited my local store...Picked up chicken  milk and salad....then visited the Mexican section...Thought  Oh look mild Enchiladas perfect!  Although I like spicy stuff i wanted MILD.....Cooked to perfection....wraps abit crispy perfect! Went to eat them begezzers my mouth was on fire...so hot.....managed to finish them 30 mins later my mouth is still burning!!! My question is why does it say mild on the box?? They are anything but.....think you need better testers! Although I could say   I nearly served this to my 7 year old and she was crying after one mouth full  I m not she saw since and wanted Beans on Toast.....good choice girl! Why was they so hot when they say mild?? They are your own brand as I wasn t paying double for a name!!!😲👺≤ this is how I feel now.....mouth burning...need....water....lots....of....water....					2016-11-15T18:31:11+0000	1479234671	2016-11-15 19:31:11	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

First time I thought the lack of cheese on my  cheese and garlic slice  was just error. However since we last spoke I think we have had Brexit and Donald Trump has been elected president. Can we blame this on them also? Or am I to reside myself to the fact that I will never have cheese on my garlic bread again!!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15094257_10210365935720636_8240716417742709211_n.jpg?oh=552415e7316be076e98701b187e8102c&oe=58E8953B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15094257_10210365935720636_8240716417742709211_n.jpg?oh=64dbee63b169842c51994f6b73e68914&oe=58E86736	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210365935720636&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-15T18:25:17+0000	1479234317	2016-11-15 19:25:17	6	9	8	0	17	8	3	5	2	0	6	0	0	2	0	0	0

These are your alleged  Extra Large Cod Fillets  you could have halved the depth of the box. I m not too fussed. It ll still be a tasty tea  but small cod would have been more appropriate and the reduction in packaging would make for a better representation of the size. Sort it out. Thanks in advance.

Drier than a nuns crotch  no juiciness  all firm n orrible instead of soft n squishy. No sweetness. Im starting to think you made them from Play Doh. This is not how one wants ones Satsumas to be. Its ruined my one a day 🤔					2016-11-15T17:52:15+0000	1479232335	2016-11-15 18:52:15	1	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	4	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

A friend of mine has a situation in which her father who suffers from Alzheimer s has been in store and purchased 5 £30 gift vouchers for Pizza Express after going in numerous times and forgetting he had already purchased the original. They were purchased during a state of him being extremely confused. Could you please tell me what your returns policy is and if we are able to return these for a refund?

I received a standard reply which did not answer my question. I replied stating it had not and have since been ignored despite emailing for a third time. So I have turned to Facebook in the hope I can get an answer publicly. I am disgusted that in 2016 there is no cruelty free make up available in my local store  I am also disgusted you decide to ignore customers questions.					2016-11-15T17:00:58+0000	1479229258	2016-11-15 18:00:58	1	9	1	0	10	9	1	8	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am still awaiting a reply.. i have contacted them only to be told that they are still awaiting a response from their support team...I am unable to eat onion or garlic and would like to know whether i can safely use this product ?/ Surely it doesn t take a week to get this information.. i have never had an enquiry take so long from any other retailer as they usually respond within 24 hours..

The reason for this is the extensive use of palm oil in your own products and branded products. Every single  dairy free butter or spread that you sell has palm oil in.

Earlier I went to one of your Extra stores to stock up on Coke Zero only to be told that it looks like the store isn t stocking them anymore. I have always purchased these in the store as 2 of us are Diabetic and we are ok with this particular Coke. Customer Services said that 1) once the store runs out  that offer is finished. 2) there were 13 boxes in the store. If the offer only started yesterday and there are mountains of Coke/Diet Coke in store but none of this one surely  something is wrong. CS suggested that I go to another store as they still have stock  30 minutes drive away or purchase 12 x 330m @ £3.55. Outcome  because we can only drink this particular Coke we are at a disadvantage  thanks Tesco :(					2016-11-15T15:32:39+0000	1479223959	2016-11-15 16:32:39	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Here s an example - these two were left to die and were reduced to £2 each. I took them home and gave them a new lease of life but it surely would also prevent wastage if Tesco watered them in the first place!  Just an idea - would it be impossible for staff to chuck them some water every now and then ?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15036188_10153887227151300_5274499897865534589_n.jpg?oh=0dcc27ab7daabf398590e9f20f0ad432&oe=58DE9FDC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15036188_10153887227151300_5274499897865534589_n.jpg?oh=904aabdf6f1262ad520606ed341c72f7&oe=58DAD0D1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153887227151300&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-15T14:05:28+0000	1479218728	2016-11-15 15:05:28	4	2	4	0	6	2	1	1	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Luckily enough I m not made like that so instead I removed all 3 from the shelf and set off to find a member of staff  eventually found a cleaner who helpfully went out the back to find someone. He then came out and explained that the seals  always get broken   there s not much they can do about it  he finally agreed to remove the items from sale. but my guess is that they will be back on the shelf today. What security measures do you have  to make sure that these items dont get  tampered ?	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCxx_XFnMKc5-Xa&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.tesco.com%2FGroceries%2Fpi%2F907%2F5054775540907%2FIDShot_225x225.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQAzbCc3BZyu-g37	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCZr_3XvYDmgcaJ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.tesco.com%2FGroceries%2Fpi%2F907%2F5054775540907%2FIDShot_225x225.jpg&_nc_hash=AQCmfk_a1v5_JjC8	http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=291760582	tesco.com	2016-11-15T13:59:31+0000	1479218371	2016-11-15 14:59:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

HUGE MISTAKE. Following security to his station was told very loudly “WAIT THERE” onlooker said “shoplifter” so I said to her NO I have robbed nothing  another HUGE MISTAKE cannot protest innocence  all went down hill from there. After them searching the waste bins for my receipt to no avail because I couldn’t remember which of the self serv tills I had used. (they all look the same) I had to point out to security guy He could quite easily check on the system as I had used club card fob. Low and behold I was cleared. But no apology. YOUR HUGE MISTAKE TESCO BEV ROAD. And once again going out of store the security alarm set off ringing again. Did I as an inocent shopper go back in to get it deactivated.

That one I m not good enough to work in your company. 2 it s automated system there fore I don t have a chance..... I m more than able to do the job at hand if not better then most people you have working for your company!!!! I find it very frustrating. You ask questions and then you answer them correctly yet still get a NO please tell me how a white working mum can get a job in tescos or at least get a interview with a human and not a computer that doesn t know anything... doesn t check references doesn t even ask for professional references!!

If I wasn t eagle eyed and already vigilant of this behaviour aware I may have fallen for this trap. Beware other customers and keep a look out!! Tesco  are you ever going to stop doing this to us and allow us to simply shop without double checking your advertised prices??					2016-11-15T13:29:40+0000	1479216580	2016-11-15 14:29:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I cannot believe a large supermarket chain would exclude baby formula from their reward points and refuse to validate a car park ticket. Honestly there really is enough pressure on Mums to breastfeed from our so called professionals but for it then to be highlighted by a supermarket chain is a step too far! Baby formula is an essential item and should not be put in the same category as smoking. Not every Mum is able to breastfeed and no judgment should be made. Every child is different and a Mother has the right to choose. I am currently on Maternity leave looking after my 4 month old daughter and have brought her formula in your stores. I am disappointed to learn that this item is excluded from your reward system. I understand that Tesco want to be seen  to be supporting breastfeeding  I just feel you are going about it the wrong way.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15036579_10153878054392175_7711439272598591490_n.jpg?oh=ece6f60b5f9ae75f7e2e6f21488c03dc&oe=59213D7D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15036579_10153878054392175_7711439272598591490_n.jpg?oh=a6bd3059e9012b6e8363d9a80e58915d&oe=5919E570	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153878054392175&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-15T13:17:43+0000	1479215863	2016-11-15 14:17:43	1	7	2	0	9	7	6	1	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

They don t keep a record of this or have the common sense to return them to the issuing Bank.They d rather you never know where your card was  fearing it s in the hands of some scrote who d fleese your account.

Sadly I have resulted in sarcastic tack ticks to get my point across  the way that this is being handled is an absolute joke. I fear that you are praying on the vulnerable parents who for whatever reasons do not want to disappoint their children at Christmas just  to get people into your stores  then to be faced with a big fat NO or we haven t had any for weeks  no idea when stock will be coming in when clearly your website which is sending alerts for local stores that you have limited stock. How can this be when you get to said store and they haven t had any for several weeks. Also when you call said store and ask the kind gentleman on the phone who then confirms they have three green draggles and two pink so you race to said store and then to be told the same story  NO STOCK. How can you be advertising online to say limited stock and then to call and be told they have 5 in total in store to then drive to the store and they have none in stock?? I feel like you need to give an explanation  The lady on Customer services said that this had happened on several occasions over the weekend but yet the local web still says as I am writing this that the shop has limited stock. This is why I am convinced that you are using underhand techniques to get people to store so they are disappointed and heartbroken that they will then chose to purchase something else from your store. Bravo Tesco on your marketing and advertising departments you should be very proud. Or is it that you are getting them in stock and staff are beating the public to it and selling them for outrageous amounts on various selling websites? Either way I think I can safely say that TESCO will not be my chosen supermarket anymore having been let down far too many times.

Then tried to add a moneycard to the order ( in the end it turns out a moneycard cannot be redeemed against a grocery order online despite the fact that it says ....or at tesco.com on he back of the card. I was sent the card to cover me for some rotten food i had bought instore.) After trying to pt the card on my bill i received an amended order conformation by email - this time with my savings of £7.40 not taken off the total. Itried to add the card again as it had not taken that amount off either ( and at no point was i advised that the voucher was not redeemable this way). This time the confirmation came back with the savings taken off.......... I tried a few more times with the savings alternately being taken off and not being taken off. Had to call the helpline this morning to sort it out. The girl i spoke to was not helpful  did not listen to the problem  did not understand why i was miffed regarding the moneycard online business etc. It should be so simple........			http://tesco.com/	tesco.com	2016-11-15T08:31:28+0000	1479198688	2016-11-15 09:31:28	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It seems like the only one that isn t exactly Christmassy at all! No sweet advert it s just a woman shopping! Anything could be better than that  all other adverts are sweet and sour Christmassy except yours  please think about it and create a new on to get everyone into the spirit of Christmas would be so much better.

Tesco building blocks were not only left unsanded  they had pieces of wood hanging out of it. Unfortunately it will only allow me to post one photo on this but have shared with tesco several photos related to this in private messages. I messaged tesco to try and resolve this issue and was told to go in store even though it was an online order - and once in store got no apology  offered no substitute just told to bring in the packet of blocks and they ll give me a refund. Am I totally bonkers for being disgusted with tesco or is this a fair reaction ? I ll try and see if I can post a photo in the comments of said blocks (there were loads in the packet not one rogue block) 😱😱	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15107438_10153873469477257_6759628974673020479_n.jpg?oh=4c2bd34dacda9972dff85c062224af0c&oe=58E1096C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15107438_10153873469477257_6759628974673020479_n.jpg?oh=d5063fbf72eff572df10a67e99e937c7&oe=58EE0018	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153873469477257&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-15T03:33:49+0000	1479180829	2016-11-15 04:33:49	3	26	10	6	42	25	10	15	13	0	3	0	1	0	1	5	0

However  within 10 minutes another email stating that there has been a problem with my order and a full refund will be given but will take 3-5 working days to go back into my bank account!!!! Yet you quite happily took the money straight out of my bank so in other words  if you do get any of these in stock within the next 3 days at least  I will be unable to purchase one as I am still waiting for the refund from you!!! If you don t have the stock don t advertise and certainly don t take money out of people s bank accounts!!! I hope your children get everything that they have asked for this xmas!!!!					2016-11-15T00:05:52+0000	1479168352	2016-11-15 01:05:52	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Director 1: Let s install 24 hour petrol pumps. Director 2: Yeah that sounds like a great idea. Director 3: An even better idea would be to install them then close the petrol station off so no one can actually use them!  Got to love your idoit company tbh!!!  Here s another great idea!   Director 1: let s hire lots of temporary staff over Xmas to help the stores  customers and staff out with the Xmas rush. Director 2: yeah that s a great idea! Director 3: Yeah that s a fantastic idea But one small change! we will sack a load of our permanent staff to off set this balance!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15094275_1125504530878773_916027877858068783_n.jpg?oh=37f1f8462cfa12a3a5f3e86ea813fb86&oe=58E128D8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15094275_1125504530878773_916027877858068783_n.jpg?oh=2ea61c3c219928518c9a795e70886cc8&oe=58F02627	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1125504530878773&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-14T23:51:46+0000	1479167506	2016-11-15 00:51:46	0	5	0	1	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Once again Tesco did not disappoint. Over the past 10 years I have been fundraising for different organisations and charities and the one supermarket who has always came through for supporting us is Tesco. This year has been particularly difficult for collecting donations. Having sent out over 30 letters and even some handed over personally by my 7 year old son we have had very little response. One main competitor of yours even refused to accept the letter from my son as they  no longer do that sort of thing . Having to explain to a 7 year old that one of the largest supermarkets couldn t help his little team wasn t an easy task - especially when all through the year and more so at this time their tills are ringing every second  but couldn t spare a small token is pathetic.  Thanks to your community representative not only for the donation but also for the lovely phonecall to offer the prize and letter wishing us luck. It really means a lot to be supported. So thank you  thank you and thanks again to Tesco Carluke for helping the little guys continue to have fun and learn new skills keeping them enthused and out of trouble for years to come!  Every little helps!  With thanks  Amanda.  Proud mum of Callan  Milton Rovers YFC Carluke 2008s.

I ve not placed my order  please advise asap so I can get my delivery as planned on Wednesday.

We had been in the hospital all morning with my daughter and so by the time we got there the breakfast had stopped being served long before. You do an all day breakfast but not for kids and it was the only thing she wanted to eat.  Your staff really kindly made her a child s breakfast just for her.  She really enjoyed it!  Thank you to the café staff for their kindness.					2016-11-14T22:39:57+0000	1479163197	2016-11-14 23:39:57	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He called and arranged to bring the crate back once he had finished another delivery - which isn t a massive issue however this was now 9pm and included my dinner. Whilst unpacking the food all the carrots fell out of their supposedly sealed pre packed bag which had a massive cut in it and then to top the evening off the calpol jar I had purchased had smashed and leaked all over my toiletries - see picture below.

They advertise toys at prices that they are not selling them for! Their excuse being that they have to use partners for when their stock runs out.  RUNS OUT? For weeks now  I ve been on a stock alert and there has been no new stock.  Who can turn down the request for a toy from the catalogue you gave the child in the first place?!

No prizes for the answer:  It s profitable!  So Tesco s apparent love affair with breast feeding stops short of damaging your pocket (now there s a surprise!)  How hypocritical can you get?  To say nothing of sheer spite - that unfortunate woman could not breastfeed her baby for medical reasons.  Not that Tesco would care about a detail like that  of course ... Shame on you.

I personally feel a bit offended by it to be fair..... I m Having a Christmas meltdown .   Whilst I m sure a lot of people get stressed by Christmas I m sure they aren t having a meltdown as this is an autistic trait  which I might add my son has as he is autistic. Have you experienced a melt down? Or understand what a melt down is? The child or adult with autism gets so overwhelmed with so much information they can t actually process all the noise light  smells etc and hence the meltdown which you can t control or prevent. Then you get stared at my ignorant people who believe your child is a spoilt brat.....when in fact their brain is working double fast and there is too much information to take in in one go.   I don t think you thought this one through very well and I was quite offended by it to be honest. My son and I visit our local Tesco quite often and a lot of the staff know about my son and always make time to chat to him even though he s 4.  I think a lot of autism parents are going to find this offensive as I have.....different wording I think should be used next year!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15078788_10154798244100739_1485799034569793417_n.jpg?oh=1da3bda32c9aa63a6f85aeeee82a480a&oe=5918CEDF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15078788_10154798244100739_1485799034569793417_n.jpg?oh=f2db0039d9c3c91fc0de44ce5a059fe3&oe=58ED4AD2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154798244100739&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-14T21:04:10+0000	1479157450	2016-11-14 22:04:10	1	7	2	0	9	7	5	2	10	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

Get to store to be told no more tvs that make I can have a different one for a extra £80! Or a smaller one for same price!!! Eeehhhh why would I want a smaller one we already had a smaller one this replaced it! And if I had a extra £80 to spend I would have brought a more expensive one in the 1st place! So now I have a lovely gift card for the price of TV but NO TV AND 2 VERY UNHAPPY CHILDREN! not good service at all  do not expect a TV to last less than a yr and certainly do not have extra money floating about this time of year for a new one!!					2016-11-14T20:16:18+0000	1479154578	2016-11-14 21:16:18	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Both of us were in The Monday Mood and inevitably  being 4  Aurora was frankly really doing my head in. I d much rather have gone straight home but being a Single Lady I have cats and they needed some of your finest cat food.  Most of the way round the store Aurora insisted on pushing the trolley and after too many near misses to count I made her sit in it (and yes there was an argument about it). As we reached the self scan checkouts I told her not to mess about pulling the trolley back and forth as the last time she did this she trapped her fingers. I told her this no less than four times. Of course I was ignored and the fingers were trapped.  I had very little sympathy and even less patience at this point but The Lovely Lady (who s name I missed) who works on the self scan checkouts at your store had lots of sympathy and patience. She  pulled out a bag of sweeties from her drawer for Aurora and put a big smile on both our faces and it reminded me to take a deep breath  Monday s don t last forever!  Of course this didn t last long because Aurora then insisted on getting in the car by herself and somehow managed to trap her head in the door so my deep breaths kind of stopped working.  But anyway  I thought it was lovely of your team member to be so kind and caring when I was clearly at my wits end so I thought I d share my story with you and hopefully my appreciation will find it s way back to The Lovely Lady so she can know she put a smile on two weary faces on such a dreary Monday evening. 👍🏻					2016-11-14T20:04:04+0000	1479153844	2016-11-14 21:04:04	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My husband rang ahead to ensure they did on 03456779751. He was told five in stock and that the store confirmed there was five.   Raced the 15 miles to get there and they tell me that they ve not had any since Saturday. Explained that we had spoken to someone and she just laughed.  Now I understand that it s very sought after and if we had got there and missed it  then fair enough but being lied to about being in stock and that  there are definitely five on the shelf but we can t hold it . I am really annoyed. More so being laughed at.					2016-11-14T19:40:55+0000	1479152455	2016-11-14 20:40:55	0	11	1	0	12	11	10	1	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Will it be slaughter machine toys what next Tesco this pathetic and degrading   The problem is that humans have victimized animals to such a degree that they are not even considered victims. They are not even considered at all. They are nothing; they don’t count; they don’t matter. They are commodities like TV sets and cell phones. We have actually turned animals into inanimate objects - sandwiches and shoes.

Surely all packed veg should of been washed and checked before put on the shelves?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15078923_1276257802434339_4198687090570002874_n.jpg?oh=53496b0b495a327f28a60a871970d2ae&oe=58E3F395	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15078923_1276257802434339_4198687090570002874_n.jpg?oh=fabf6e2a7adbb4d3fb10b8f1d0f402f2&oe=58E23B80	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1276257802434339&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-14T17:54:00+0000	1479146040	2016-11-14 18:54:00	3	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	2	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0

I m a part time wheelchair user but when it comes to shopping I have to use my wheelchair due to the pain from various illnesses. We couldn t see any wheelchair trolleys so we asked at customer service just in case they had moved them. We were told they were all broken and we re waiting for new ones  and that was that no offer of assisted shopping  which I know is offered due to working in retail over 12 years ago. I was absolutely fuming because we now could not do the big shop we needed to do or use the voucher because I cannot wheel myself or keep a basket on my lap due to my health.  Surely all the disabled trolleys did not break all at once? So why leave it until they all break to order new ones? And why was no assistance offered? Was it because we are a young couple because I always see plenty of elderly people who are in better health than myself getting the assistance they need  but younger disabled people get ignored and swept to the side with a not my problem attitude?  I barely socialise due to anxiety so shopping is my release and common place I know and we always go at a quiet time due to this but today my anxiety hit me very hard because of the way I was treated as a disabled customer! It takes away your freedom when little things like this happen  if they were all being used then ok but the fact that no one had the common sense to order new ones when they re tatty old ones started breaking one by one I do not know?! Some people will think this is a pathetic small problem but to someone who is disabled it s not small  it means we lose a bit of independence that we try so hard to keep.					2016-11-14T17:45:55+0000	1479145555	2016-11-14 18:45:55	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Even more so when I was charged for it at the till.  I questioned the girl on the till who came out with a spiel of “oh yes we charge for those now” in a very matter of fact convincing way.  I must admit I was shocked and thought it was rather cheeky but was in a hurry to get back to work so let it slide as there was a queue of impatient people behind me.  Once back at work unpacking my shopping I went from bemused to annoyed as the catalogue blatantly has a label stating its free!!!  I know it’s only 1p but I feel that it’s rather sneaky to stealth target parents in this way.  I bet all those penny’s add up to rather a nice sum as most parents will absent mindedly will pick up catalogues and not notice.  I’m rather shocked that this is acceptable practice and it definitely makes me think less favourable of the Tesco brand.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15109375_10157756788175346_6127405253412908144_n.jpg?oh=57c76fe741b91a06d2503ea782c057e5&oe=58DED309	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15109375_10157756788175346_6127405253412908144_n.jpg?oh=1050572df824855db6db2871b127f8c9&oe=58E6AB04	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157756788175346&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-14T16:25:21+0000	1479140721	2016-11-14 17:25:21	7	13	17	1	31	13	3	10	18	0	7	0	7	0	0	3	0

Made a small hole into the package and the meat was disgusting and it stunk so I took it straight back to the shop. They didn t replace it as I didn t have the receipt which I think is irrelevant in this case. How disrespectful it is with people who eat pork. They also didn t want to smell the meat as it s pork and they don t eat pork....well no one told the guy to eat it...such a genius....😠😠					2016-11-14T15:51:16+0000	1479138676	2016-11-14 16:51:16	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They both went above and beyond their jobs to try and help me  it is much appreciated. Unfortunately that is where the thank you s and appreciation end. My food shopping delivery which was due today  has had to be returned to store  leaving my  my husband  and my children of ages 11  9  3 and 4 months without food  nappies and baby milk. My food shopping came to £74.09  of which I was paying £51 from my clubcard vouchers  and the remaining £23.09 from my debit card. Order put through online no problems  email confirmation received and clubcard vouchers showing on my clubcard account as spent. No problems right?? WRONG!! According to your customer services  I needed the full amount of £74.09 in my bank account in order for you to take the payment  and as this wasn t the case I couldn t have my delivery. Not once on my order  emails  tesco website... In fact NOWHERE  does it state that the full amount needs to be available funds - if it did  or I actually had the full amount available  I wouldn t have wanted to use my clubcard vouchers now would I?! Because of this I now have no food  no baby milk and no nappies  and I am going to have to drag my 4 children out in the cold and borrow money to do my food shopping until my clubcard vouchers can be reissued and used. Absolutely appalling service tescos  I am disgusted at you.					2016-11-14T15:50:21+0000	1479138621	2016-11-14 16:50:21	1	11	4	1	16	11	7	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	3	0

I ve a young baby and each and every time I visit the store I cannot get a parking space in the parent and child section. Each time I m there I witness people without children parking in the spaces. As I type I am sat waiting for a couple driving a 2 seater van to move as they re in a parent and baby space. Clearly no baby or car seat in a 2 seater van! Often it causes me to visit the local Morrisons store instead as I m always guaranteed a space there but today I have some vouchers to use in Tesco otherwise I would not be sat here queueing for a space. Someone desperately needs to get on the case with your parking at this store!					2016-11-14T14:13:06+0000	1479132786	2016-11-14 15:13:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I drive 40min round trip to my Tesco instead of walking across the road to Morrisons  only fill up at Tesco petrol stations.  All to be a loyal customer and thought my custom was appreciated.......... but apparently not!!! For approx 15 months now I ve not received a single e coupon I ve made numerous phones calls and been given all sorts of excuses only to learn today that my custom isn t good enough anymore to receive these e coupons as I don t for fill the right criteria anymore for  marketing  to send me a booklet of coupons as only a small selected few get them now.  Funny how as soon as they got done for fiddling their books all the sudden my coupons stop coming seams there is more dodgy business going on than we know of!!  How many other clients haven t received any for a prolonged period now?  Please comment and let s see!!   If my custom isn t good enough then I guess my money isn t either  Lidl and Morrisons seams good option now!					2016-11-14T14:04:25+0000	1479132265	2016-11-14 15:04:25	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m a fairly loyal customer these days. Visit once a week  spend a lot of money etc. This is normally at your Cardington Road store in Bedford  shopping there is a pleasant experience. Today  however I happened to venture to a different branch  only a couple of miles away on riverview drive and am so disappointed. The store itself is fine  strange layout  but fine. But the cafe? Oh my God the cafe! I m out with my 11 month old baby for lunch and it has been awful from start to finish. There s hardly any food to choose from  but theres chips of course  with a side of chips if you like! But that s fine  I got a sausage roll with some. The staff as lovely as they are  dont really seem to know what they re doing and struggled with taking payment and serving customers. Now I ve had my food served to my table and I cannot actually cut through the sausage roll with my knife. Needless to say  Im not going to eat it. The cost didn t exactly reflect the value of the food/service I was given! Has put me off in a big way  I m sorry to say!					2016-11-14T13:54:26+0000	1479131666	2016-11-14 14:54:26	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got home and started to cook. Imagine our shock when we were about to put the corn on the cob in the microwave   a 4 pack wasn t in fact a 4 pack at all....there was only 3!!! Seriously....3??!!! So who was the person that was left without one?? The one who went to get the goods...the one who did most of the cooking...the one who was really looking forward to a corn on the cob....ME....that s who....ME!!! Trying to look good in front of the in laws I couldnt let them go without or my other half. I took the hit and went without. Not impressed at all Tescos....seriously let down :( Whoever is packing these needs to go back to school and learn how to count!!

As someone who goes to great lengths to recycle everything  I ve tried getting my deliveries without bags  but when I do a big shop  it takes forever to unpack the crates  I don t have enough surface area to put everything  and it takes twice as long to sort it all out. So I ve asked for bags on the basis I can at least recycle them  and I always give my used bags back to the driver. However  today s shop of 128 items was delivered in over 40 plastic bags - that s about 3 items in a bag. Many of them contained only one item. Even the 9-roll toilet roll pack  which barely fits in a bag  was in one. Is it quite necessary to use so many?! There seems little point trying to encourage customers to go bagless if you then use three times as many on those that have them. Or are you trying to make us feel so guilty at the excess that we refuse any more?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15085605_10153910835156759_8654369977735442881_n.jpg?oh=cf1d712b3d3054fe108e3dc5f741d8b6&oe=5920BC9E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15085605_10153910835156759_8654369977735442881_n.jpg?oh=bd7221bc14bd3187d930d62f415ae414&oe=59194D93	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153910835156759&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-14T13:20:09+0000	1479129609	2016-11-14 14:20:09	6	2	7	0	9	1	1	0	0	0	6	0	1	0	0	0	0

I have a new dog with a fetish for shoes!  17 pairs to date have ended up in the big shoe box in the sky.  I bought said shoes for school in September as they seemed a better price if they did one day end up in Rupert s paws £16 each pair.  After 6 weeks the sole came adrift on one of the boots right up to the heel.  What a state she must have looked her teacher had celotaped it back together to get her home.  Oh ek. I thought.  Knowing I hadn t paid so much for them still left me disappointed with the quality.  Tesco is a good brand!  Oh well as I don t live in Bridlington I m not making a special trip.  Last week my eldest girl came home with exactly the same issue.  I took them back yesterday and was greeted by the clothing manager.  I explained my disappointment.  She told me they looked far older than 6/8 weeks old and as I hadn t got my receipt I couldn t prove it.  I said my girls were only 8 and 10. I would have expected them to grow out of them before they fell apart.  The manager pointed out that they were not leather and we re very scuffed.  I pointed out that I was not complaining about them being scuffed that they had not my expectations as a Tesco product.  The manager was very curt.  she made me feel humiliated and embarrassed in front of other customers basic asking me to prove it.  I am very disappointed with how a Tesco manager could be rude  I felt she was questioning my integrity.  Every little helps.. I don t think so!					2016-11-14T13:15:45+0000	1479129345	2016-11-14 14:15:45	0	12	0	0	12	12	2	10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have 2 a day everyday at work  I bought my usual bunch of 10 from your Tesco Extra near Pendleton Way in Salford. Bought my 1st 5 in today & placed them in their usual happy spot in the corner of my desk. About 2 hours later I realised there were big cobweb type things from my bunch of bananas to my colleagues fan just to my left with little black creepy crawlies everywhere. Thankfully the fan was turned off  it was really gross! I wish I d taken a photo but I was too busy running to get masses of tissue. It resulted in people panicking  itching like crazy for a few hours and a massive crazed nervous clean up. It resulted in lost work time  understandably a bit of embarrassment for myself  we also had clients in. So disappointed  recently whenever I get bananas from the small Tesco on Trafford Road in Salford they seem to be rubbish & not good for much. I am a disappointed banana consumer.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15079056_10157497609685538_7379581033627666165_n.jpg?oh=39b6508473da8eca569787b09f592377&oe=591E30D9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15079056_10157497609685538_7379581033627666165_n.jpg?oh=2824d64c78fd9467fcafe24d0210ffa8&oe=5919C5D4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157497609685538&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-14T12:57:45+0000	1479128265	2016-11-14 13:57:45	1	9	6	0	15	9	2	7	2	0	1	0	3	2	0	0	0

Not only was it uncomfortable as a customer watching that but as a woman watching another woman s boyfriend speak to her in such an aggressive way in such a public forum. I think some shop floor conduct needs to be addressed with the team members of this store as this is not the first time I have been in there and something of this nature happen (the last time was 4 members of staff standing around talking about how messed up they planned to get that weekend etc.)					2016-11-14T12:46:00+0000	1479127560	2016-11-14 13:46:00	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every week you have discontinued a product I buy weekly. Every week I have wasted time  first trying to locate the product  then finding out it has been discontinued.  I have spoken to countless duty managers  all have told me  it s not us  it s head office . Well Head Office  I have now crossed the bridge and yes  I have found that pastures are greener with your competitor.  They cater for families  they cater for people who cook  for people who have regular contact with the continent and love a variety of foods. I do not care about the aisles full of crisps  pot noodles and coke. I wish to choose between Tesco branded and non Tesco branded (funny how this portion gets discontinued!).  A couple of weeks ago I wanted to buy my usual box of 15 free range eggs! Of course discontinued.  How can you discontinue eggs?????   Anyway  highlighted are some of the items you have decided to discontinue  some of them just last week and that was what tipped me over. Those 7 items you use to sell are part of a very small shop for me  this £50 shop was just a tester. I found out my new online set up will work for our family. Not need to waste 1.5 hour weekly trying to locate products you keep on moving around at best or discontinue at worse.  To you  I was worth £110/week  that is over £5000/year. You have decided I was not worth catering for  you have preferred students to local families (apparently this is your target market in Guildford  so I was told). That was your strategic choice. I think you got it wrong.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/s130x130/14705773_10153906053595776_1020570393452664720_n.jpg?oh=689f49ba4c6067bd7444e624bdb707e0&oe=59219FDB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14705773_10153906053595776_1020570393452664720_n.jpg?oh=84f14f644382b605ad293c237ec5776f&oe=591EFDAB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153906053595776&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-14T12:17:32+0000	1479125852	2016-11-14 13:17:32	6	7	6	0	13	7	4	3	2	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

When we had finished our shopping and got into the car I couldn t wait and had to have one  BUT to my dissapointment when I bit into it there no chocolate even thou on the packagaing it was stated  stuffed with chocolate filling  I thought oh well maybe they just missed one so I tried another and again no chocolate. Neither did my sons and when we tested the other 2 they didn t either.   This is a huge dissapointment when your craving them and nothing else with do and have a 3 year wanting a chocolate fix  it wouldn t have been so bad if the actual dognuts were fantastic because they weren t.  Please see attached photos of packaging and receipt In comments.  Waiting to hear a reply from you on how you are going to fix this solution.

Decided as I use your online shop for groceries I would order my sons main birthday present and have it delivered £3 (cheaper than bus fare £4) also the thought I would definitely get a working one in a nice box and have it by the 20th! That was my big mistake. Opened the parcel to a broken box and thought I would try it any how  but No the beat bo didn t work either! Did someone not think to try the tester button before sending it out?

My daughter has a very rare medical condition where most foods put her into degrees of anaphylaxis but we found that she was ok with those....they also give her the salt her body needs because of another condition....it wasn t til she put them in her mouth she realised the recipe had changed (nothing on the packaging!) ...formerly it was just corn and oil as simple as you can get...fortunately so far she seems to have coped with them but told me they are more greasy and not as nice.  We are also at that time of year where she can t shop in your stores anymore  well at least go anywhere near fruit and veg thanks to the loose nuts out...affects her breathing as soon as she s anywhere near...

The base of my chest freezer was full of milk that had leaked out. I ve been unable to defrost them in the fridge too as they leak.

Maybe it was another parent in need who knows  ether way THIS mum right here needs her chocolate fix and the kids will be left with out one (unless I go to the shop which lets face it is going to happen more than once as I always forget something let s hope it s not the cake or I d tell them what happened and you don t want that) please please replace my cake and save me the horror of telling the kids that I ate the only edible one..	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15032752_10211568914803560_2676143024239889217_n.jpg?oh=e644d4148e67c9e04946314ebd6dcea7&oe=58DBF015	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15032752_10211568914803560_2676143024239889217_n.jpg?oh=e9b4f90b03a3af03ccf7757c4c6b7e52&oe=59244E18	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211568914803560&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-13T21:56:23+0000	1479074183	2016-11-13 22:56:23	0	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

It looked like a load of rotting food. There was Ham that had a use by date of 13 November( so we had one day to eat it)  seasame buns that had use by date of 12 not November ( eat that day in other words) and the list of short dated food goes on. I rang and complained and was given a refund of just over 11 pound. Quite frankly as a loyal customer I feel I should have had a full refund. My shopping cost 61 pound. Over 11 pounds worth of food was inedible. The shopping was delivered from Penzance Cornwall store.

I spotted your brand here in Dublin for €15 and just double checked it online to see if it was cheaper in Newry. Imagine my horror when I read it was £5 for the exact same product there!  With the sterling exchange of. 116 it should cost €5.80  even if you rounded it up to allow for sterling fluctuations €6.50  would be fair enough.  Taking into account excise duty it still can t possibly be that much of a difference.  Why are you charging your Southern Irish customers €15 a bottle for a £5 bottle of cava?

I confirmed the 8-10am delivery slot (for £7). Got up at 7.30 (on a Sunday!) but no one turned up.  I emailed.  Tesco called at around 14.00 to apologise  saying that a delivery van had been at the house  rung the bell but found no one was in. Well  firstly we do not have a door bell  but we do have three dogs (that bark) and last but nit least I was home all day! They said they would reschedule for 17.30 this afternoon.  Of course I was a little annoyed  but accepted the new delivery time as I do need food in the house and didn t fancy driving all the way into town (40min drive each way!). It s now 19.30 and still no delivery  or phone call... 🤔					2016-11-13T20:06:17+0000	1479067577	2016-11-13 21:06:17	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

An old chap had tried to go onto the travellator  but could not hold onto the trolley  which then hurtled down the ramp and struck her in the back. She was badly hurt and shaken  and customer services were quick to attend. However  they called for the first aid manager  who refused to put the incident into the accident book  as he believed Tesco are not at fault. I am shocked by this attitude  as I believe if these trolleys are not suitable to go down the travellator  then surely there should be be some mechanism to prevent it from going onto the ramp? Not all old or disabled people look to read warning signs and I dont think this is good enough an excuse not to enter in the accident book. My sister cares for her disabled husband as well as working full time. She looked pretty poorly this afternoon  but has expressed that she was grateful that this was not a small child at the bottom of the ramp  as the consequences could have been unthinkable. She felt sorry for the elderly gentleman as he also looked very shocked and upset also.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14993533_10211068381564644_3679819301460003887_n.jpg?oh=0e7b4fd9b34fc5fbec5f787f919e34ba&oe=58E3EA23	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14993533_10211068381564644_3679819301460003887_n.jpg?oh=01abb777961b2f6a68934dcd8828c90f&oe=58ED002E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211068381564644&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-13T18:27:09+0000	1479061629	2016-11-13 19:27:09	5	14	6	3	23	13	8	5	2	0	5	0	1	0	0	0	0

I ve just called to notify you of my new address - and to point out that someone somewhere has fouled up when producing your latest promotional vouchers.  In your Tesco Clubcard Christmas mailing ( A little help from your vouchers in the run-up to Christmas) you ve enclosed a £5 and a £0.50 coupon.  Both coupons have an expiry date of 31/11/2018.    31 November 2018.  November has only 30 days.  There is no 31 November.  Oops.

How about a chicken salad roll one  how about festive roll like turkey cranberry roll possibly for next xmas? How about gluten free falafel houmous roll. There are quite a few things in Tesco I would like to have a try. I m gluten and dairy intolerant so be good if can cater for both some are soya and egg intolerant so some options for others with those intolerances. How about duck rolls etc. Gluten free soy sauce u can use for Chinese stuff too. How about sweet chilli chicken roll.

She wanted to use a prepaid Mastercard she had brought though me (see the picture) she was told she couldn t use it for payment. She went to the customer service desk and they called through to your head office and they said the same. The thing I want to question is the fact that s it s a Mastercard a payment method you accept. On the website of the card issuer it s described as a card that s accepted anywhere you can use a Mastercard. So with this in mind why was my mother made to feel so embarrassed in a busy store but staff who clearly didn t know what payment methods you accept. I was planning to go shopping in the same store with my own card but I don t feel you deserve my custom.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15095604_10154670740938349_4780229292769169721_n.jpg?oh=92f1c817d5380be0363db09a155137b2&oe=591D7563	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15095604_10154670740938349_4780229292769169721_n.jpg?oh=543daaca34622f94d7e5a0ee93120a4f&oe=58EC736E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154670740938349&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-13T16:34:52+0000	1479054892	2016-11-13 17:34:52	1	6	1	0	7	5	2	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I shot to my local tesco  under the misguided notion that they wouldn t let me down. I sauntered in  headed full of confidence to the veg section  to be greeted by 3 sorry looking cauli s. It was akin to visiting the local dog shelter  i felt like the one I picked was begging me to release him from his misery rotting away in a battered old green crate. So I picked the little fella up  and took him home to fulfill his potential as part of a family roast. Only to arrive home  out of the bright glare of the lights of tesco  to be confronted with what can only be described as a cauliflower no larger than an apple. If I had paid for the weight of it  I d have been better investing my 95p in to some precious metals instead  I d probably have got more for my money.  It was so small  my equally distraught wife asked if there was a minimum weight printed on the packaging  which led me to discover the final cherry on top. The sorry looking little cauliflower was already 2 days past his best before  I m not entirely sure what his best would have been but I m guessing it wouldn t have been too impressive. Anyways  I m off to go and eat a roast  minus the cauliflower cheese I was so looking forward to  I ll leave you with my parting gift  photos of this now infamous little cauliflower  Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns  Liam Jones  PS  I ve named him Colin  I hope you don t mind	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15032783_10154349259788005_5219054798740959266_n.jpg?oh=b6b223568611fa3495a7dd2fc23161be&oe=5919AE8B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15032783_10154349259788005_5219054798740959266_n.jpg?oh=8d68128c89146ce97515e6bbaa979696&oe=58E590FF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154349259788005&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-13T16:14:16+0000	1479053656	2016-11-13 17:14:16	1	4	9	1	14	4	4	0	5	0	1	3	0	5	0	0	0

After attempting to contact my local community champion (on numerous occasions!!) asking if it would be possible to promote my community group - Nippers Nutrition - via a poster in store  I ve been left absolutely fuming at the fact that they haven t even had the decency to even acknowledge that I exist  let alone respond to my request.   Although I am aware that Tesco must get inundated with a multitude of promotional requests  I would like to think that you care enough about aiding our childhood obesity crisis to at least acknowledge someone who is trying to aid the weight and well-being of children for free - particularly as you ve recently introduced a free fruit for kids scheme!!   I know that many may see my complaint as minor and/or irrelevant  but as it s an area that I am extremely passionate about and I feel that supermarkets such as Tesco have the ability to aid awareness of (even if it is something as simple as a poster!)  I wanted to highlight my concerns in the hope that you may make something so important a priority for your community champions.					2016-11-13T14:00:15+0000	1479045615	2016-11-13 15:00:15	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was at Tescos Extra Grimsby Victoria Street this morning waiting for the store to open  I was parked in parent and child as I was with my 9 week old daughter and I was fortunate to get a space. I saw two cars- one in the bay next to me (as per photo) who never had a child at all never mind one under 5 and the car parked opposite had a child of about 9/10 years old.  This is a clear abuse of the policy you have in place  it is very very hard to get a parent and child parking space at this store and the other day i had to park at the bottom of the car park lugging my  baby and car seat up to the store in the freezing cold  this is after  having to park next to shrubbery so I could get the car seat out of the car. The car parked next to me stayed  in the bay for over an hour. I informed your customer service and I was told that as Tescos don t own the car par there is nothing they could do.  I am appalled  those parking bays are vital for parents with carseats/ prams and you should be enforcing that customers dont take advantage of this and to say it is not your car park when it is full of your signs is ridiculous.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15032855_709546569193155_6588955780199807230_n.jpg?oh=0b154f7f2a66dd9bb9d20cebbd0f0827&oe=58E2C9FE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q83/s720x720/15032855_709546569193155_6588955780199807230_n.jpg?oh=05f022d0a006360773f766875cacc6dc&oe=5922BFD4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=709546569193155&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-13T13:36:20+0000	1479044180	2016-11-13 14:36:20	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Seriously impressed with the new catalogue that you have brought out. We have 2 Autistic children in our family and as a result sometimes santa struggles to know what to bring. This year I spotted these  stocked up and set them away to do them! We have the most comprehensive list! It was easy to do and the enjoyed it! It was a family activity and opened up to a lot of discussion about toys they want  why they want them etc!!  I m sure santa 🎅 will be relieved at how much easier it will be this year! One of our children struggles and we normally only get asked about 2-3 things  this year we have over 10 things to pick from!  Problem will be is santas sack big enough for them all this year!  Something so simple has saved us hours of wondering aimlessly round shops and sending santa a guess list!   🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻  Thank you Tesco!  🎉👍🏻👌🏻  #autism #austismawareness #christmas #santa #presents #tesco	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15037267_10157657847450265_8415207267449135717_n.jpg?oh=3c32687bac6627b3ca9308dd86b2758d&oe=58E7E5EF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15037267_10157657847450265_8415207267449135717_n.jpg?oh=8a6b5a18f797951d89732e20791ab476&oe=58E115E2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157657847450265&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-13T13:20:20+0000	1479043220	2016-11-13 14:20:20	6	1	6	1	8	1	1	0	2	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

We live in North Devon and on bonfire night our four year old daughter Maisie suffered awful burns from a firework that flew across the field horizontally instead of vertically. She is currently being treated by Bristol Children s Hospital and is back in surgery for the third time in a week tomorrow. While we have been in hospital she saw an advert for the much sought after  Hatchimal  and decided that was the only thing she wanted for Christmas. It soon became apparent that it would be easier to find her the unicorn she d asked for last Christmas! I asked on Facebook if anyone had a Hatchimal I could buy and before I knew it Sue and the team at Tesco Extra had scoured stores nationwide  found  and delivered to our door  this very Hatchimal for us to stash away for Maisie for Christmas. A get well gift from them too her ❤️ They have made one little girls Christmas  thank-you so much.

I was so happy when I found you were selling them here in the UK.    I was wondering if you had any plans on bringing them back?   It s hard for vegetarians to find jellies without meat products in them  and these ones are such a great product  it s such a shame that they seemed to have gone.

We can t use the other brands you stock as they contain apple fibre and they were a good buy for my partner who has to follow a IBS strict diet. I m sure there are lots of other people who used to buy them as they were never on offer  and we never found them reduced as they were close to the use by date. Please can you rethink about discontinuing or offer a substitute that is not just gluten free but also does not contain apple fibre and apple or pear juice in them  I realise you have to cater for many but just simple gluten free would be awesome.

My da is 72 and has suffered from alzheimers for a number of years. We live less than 100 yards from the store and my ma and da would be in the shop everyday  however they were stopped by security today and informed that my da wasnt allowed in and was barred for 3 months.  Every morning he would take a walk for 5-10 mins  usually to yorkgate and back up  apparently this morning he went into the shop picked up a paper and tried to walk out before being stopped  due to his illness he would a been unaware what he was doing and removed from the store.  When they were stopped and informed of the ban my mum explained his condition to the security guard who got the manager   again they were informed of my das illness and that he would a been unware but the manager didnt care he said that he was barred. This flies in the face of the other staff especially in their post office part who have been brillant with my da  if he gets to the counter and its clear he is on his own they would ring our house and keep him there till we get there.  You would think they would use common sense  but not in this case. Instead they would rather stop and embarrass two pensioners. Customer services are a joke they asked me to speak to the manager and explain the situation despite me telling them the manager was informed but didnt seem to care .  Id be better speaking to the wall.					2016-11-13T09:08:13+0000	1479028093	2016-11-13 10:08:13	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ducked into the Tesco to escape and the staff let me hide out there for a while  made sure the guy had gone away and gave me a coffee before I left. Not sure if I thanked them properly as all I wanted to do was get away from the situation and get to work but your staff were amazing!					2016-11-13T08:06:48+0000	1479024408	2016-11-13 09:06:48	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I want a hatchimal for my Daughter and have been checking stock numerous times a day at various sites/stores. I came across one on tesco direct (sold by fun collectables) however it was priced at £129.99. I realise this is not priced by you but it is preying on desperate people and I would say amounts to daylight robbery. Surely this is not something you would want to be affiliated with.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15085590_10154651083953142_7840296670515992267_n.jpg?oh=af21459529481f5ac718bf5c17c32a9d&oe=58EDD8B6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15085590_10154651083953142_7840296670515992267_n.jpg?oh=a7a826c0c45ecaa04d49aab90dc189ff&oe=5920BDBB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154651083953142&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-12T22:44:02+0000	1478990642	2016-11-12 23:44:02	4	3	8	0	11	3	2	1	2	0	4	0	4	0	0	0	0

Delivery still not arrived....rang customer services and the answer is that the driver isn t answering his mobile phone and nor is the depot....for the past 45 minutes!!! Only answer is that he s obviously not coming. Great!

Mum and I split up to go to separate tills  and one lovely lady called Melissa (part of your team) came to help me. I think it was obvious I was struggling at self check out! Melissa and I got chatting while putting the shopping through and I told her about my disability which also means that I m now unable to eat due to my stomach being paralysed. I didn t think anything of it but then Melissa appeared with these beautiful flowers; and she said  you might not be able to eat but you can enjoy these flowers  I was so shocked and overwhelmed  it didn t hit me till I was in the car and the happy tears started! Its the nicest thing someone I don t know has done for me since becoming disabled  and it really has made my month. So thank you Melissa  you are a true diamond! Love  Rachel ☺️ 🌺 xx  (P.S.

I am raising money for a local charity called Special Olympics and I have been asking local businesses for donations for a raffle. The manager of this store  Tim  has been so kind and helpful. When I initially went in to enquire about this  he was welcoming  friendly and personable. Nothing was too much trouble and he seemed genuinely happy to help. Today I went into the store to collect the item he agreed to donate (a lovely bottle of champagne) and  as ever  he was welcoming and friendly  and even gave £10 of his own money towards the cause. He is a credit to your company.					2016-11-12T19:56:48+0000	1478980608	2016-11-12 20:56:48	2	3	3	0	6	3	1	2	3	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

Last shop my driver was half an hour late and I didn t get a text until her arrived  he was very apologetic as he was running late because he was made go make a 15 mins drive in only a few mins which made him late for the other s which I understand but you need to sort out your system so us customers actually get informed you are gunna be late!   This shop I get a phone call saying that most off your drivers are off and expected me to find someone to pick it up for me (I have no one to) I have a three year old to feed  I just had enough food left today to feed us without going out as I knew I had a food delivery  so I said no I need my food tonight has I have I have no food left and my daughter wouldn t have any breakfast in the morning. So they said they will delivery it tonight but are gunna be late  why couldn t they just say they will be late instead of trying to avoid doing their job! OK there were less drivers but you find away to do it!  Not happy!					2016-11-12T19:34:57+0000	1478979297	2016-11-12 20:34:57	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You can t even use the excuse we have ran out this time as there is hardly anything in the pots   which is shocking considering how busy this store is!  This is your superstore bicester!  Thanks!

It was not good very little roasted aubergine and what was there was soggy due to the very wet tomato mush that it was cooked with.  Also the mozzarella topping was very sparse.  Sp sparse in fact that I am surprised that Tesco would mention it on the box. An extremely disappointing meal for a vegetarian!					2016-11-12T18:42:24+0000	1478976144	2016-11-12 19:42:24	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My young son was unfortunately sick in store and both ladies were so kind and helpful that they made a very stressed mummy feel at ease and calm.  They arranged to choose some replacement clothing whilst I stripped and cleaned my son up.   They brought water and replaced my trolley and some shopping which he was unfortunately sick over.  They also gave him a lovely gift once we were all cleaned up and ready to leave.  Unfortunately I didn t get their names but on checking the box from the Toy they gave him noticed one of them had written Katie on it.  If you could find out who they were and pass on my heartfelt thanks I would be most grateful.  They were indeed a credit to customer service at Tesco.  Kind Regards   Caroline Reynolds & Theo					2016-11-12T18:39:59+0000	1478975999	2016-11-12 19:39:59	3	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	3	1	0	0	0	0	0

I have a very poorly one year old and a very active 3 year old and needed to get to Tesco to collect medication and do a quick food shop! I go to my local Tesco in Twickenham to find that the car park is FULL of cars that do not belong to Tesco customers but to people that have gone to watch the rugby! Cars where parked on path ways  in front of trolley parks and to top it off not one car in the parent and child spaces had car seats in them....meaning they had no children with them! When I approached a member of staff he laughed at me  and asked me what I wanted him to do?!?!? While continuing to eat his pringles!!! It took me 25 mins just to get out the car park and get on my way to the next Tesco.   I then go to Tesco in Osterley....car park pretty busy...disabled bays and parent and child spaces filled with dumped trolleys! I finally find a space and do my shopping..... At the check out the young lady serving me did not offer any help...gave me only 3 bags for a full weeks worth of shopping  and kept shouting to other members of staff to ask when her break was! She scanned my shopping so fast and was asking about her break so much she ignored the fact I was asking for more bags and that my shopping was piling up with no where for me to put it! To make things even worse I get home and find that she didn t even scan my coupons and that I had been charged in full for everything!  What an awful service and truly stressful experience! Looks like I ll be going to Sainsbury s from now one!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡					2016-11-12T18:37:28+0000	1478975848	2016-11-12 19:37:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was split for him to eat. He had already eaten a 1/4 whe  He noticed that there was a dark patch on another bit. I thought it was a pip and telling him to dig it out to find that it wasn t a pip. But it was black inside about 1cm all round. Upon further examination of it there seems to be a puncture hole on the skin on the outside and the pith on the inside is stained red. Is there anything you can do. I have also messaged you.

Very embarrassing. I took it back to the store I purchased it from and they have no more and are unable to assist me further. I have received a a refund and told to go online. I have gone online and the coat is not on there  they have it in blue but only in a size 10. I am not happy as you can imagine  I am now left with no winter coat and being incredibly embarrassed at a meeting.					2016-11-12T16:59:45+0000	1478969985	2016-11-12 17:59:45	0	10	0	0	10	10	3	7	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today me my partner and my 13month old daughter went shopping and found a Teltubbie lala sing along toy which we decided to buy for our daughter. She played with it all round the store until we got to the checkout  she loved it. As we went to pay for the item the chashier told us it would not scan. He then gave it to my daughter anyway and asked a colleague to find a replacement that would scan.  She eventually came back to inform us all of those toys were not filed and could not be sold which then meant she had to take it from my daughter who was very upset and confused.   This has completely angered me. I would like to know why the toys are out to be bought and not even filed on the system and also how this will be rectified as it has caused unnecessary upset to my daughter.					2016-11-12T16:57:58+0000	1478969878	2016-11-12 17:57:58	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I didn t realise that the click and the collect wasn t opened til 10am  and she opened it up and got my stuff for me anyway  even though I was early.  She was lovely about it as well.  She didn t realise  but because we didn t have to wait  we made the cinema in time and didn t lose our pre-booked tickets.     I ve had some really good service from Tesco over the years and I just wanted to say  thank you!					2016-11-12T15:08:13+0000	1478963293	2016-11-12 16:08:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We recently bought a rubber pig dog toy from your Wisbech store. This is the third toy of this type that we ve bought from there  as our dog loves them! We ve just gone to wrap it up for Christmas  and as we pulled the tags off it prior to wrapping  a piece of stuffing came out with it! After much pulling we finally got all of the stuffing out of the toy  which is shown in the attached photo  with my hand for reference on size/amount. As I said  this is the third of this type of toy we ve bought from the wisbech store  and the two before did not come with stuffing (nor does a rubber squeaky toy need it!). If we hadnt have caught this  there is a good chance our dog would have eaten at least some of it once her teeth inevitably broke through the rubber! If it had been a soft toy  i would expect to be on the lookout for stuffing as she played with it  but not a rubber chew toy. Can this be investigated  because to us as dog owners this is a major design flaw  and potentially harmful to pets.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14962792_10154814642168120_7573716522944030044_n.jpg?oh=2c286f8f53309448c5c81a05215aca10&oe=58E21076	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14962792_10154814642168120_7573716522944030044_n.jpg?oh=61e955de2817f6888b9ef7599c399827&oe=59194D7B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154814642168120&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-12T14:43:00+0000	1478961780	2016-11-12 15:43:00	0	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

Well I was half right  the half I was wrong was the fact that the whipster junior was missing. I only opened it today and found this problem. I wouldn t mind normally but I wanted the small one to make hot drinks with. Kind of gutted right now. Serves me right for thinking I was getting a good deal...					2016-11-12T14:41:57+0000	1478961717	2016-11-12 15:41:57	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tosay my son suffered a bad nose bleed (he is prone to them)  while in Tesco. I approached the counter that makes fresh pizza for some tissue. The woman behind it got some blue tissue straight away and asked if we needed a first aider to help. I told her no we would be fine  she then said if we felt we needed it at any point just to ask. We where then approached by a male worker (I think from the same counter or a nearby one) who told me he was a retired paramedic  and could he take a look. He was very friendly and joked with my son. He stayed with us untilbthe bleeding stopped.  Both members of staff were polite  helpful and couldn t do enough for us.

I ve just chucked my just delivered pack away due to a little dropping left as a gift from a rodent friend of yours  we don t seem to have any nibbled fruit however  so not sure if it was a case of them hating on raspberries and holding a dirty protest in the pack or maybe  they got caught mid mission to sneak a nibble and had the poop scared out of them? I now feel guilty I ve chucked them as I could have maybe popped them in to the field at the end of my garden for a little treat for their friends out there? Please let me know the best course of action going forward here.  🐭	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14956038_10154214082133471_6248947392877427461_n.jpg?oh=c6e1e2979acd9db1257876b11dfa8024&oe=58DB48D3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14956038_10154214082133471_6248947392877427461_n.jpg?oh=221784f4e11112df07cffd86d178e295&oe=58EA46DE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154214082133471&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-12T13:57:57+0000	1478959077	2016-11-12 14:57:57	1	11	2	0	13	11	3	8	5	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

I buy several a week for my lunch. But all my favourites have been spoiled. More flour and less ham in the pea and ham. No mushroom pieces in the mushroom soup. Less lentils and some strange cabbage type leaves in the tomato and lentil. Less chicken and the same strange leaves in the Thai chicken. This is supposed to be a premium product. If you are struggling to make a profit on it  increase the price don t reduce the quality.

No extra vouchers e.g 25 extra points when you buy cheese etc. No clubcard boost offers. Went in store to Long Eaton. The store is being upgraded to included several LADIES clothes shops  Dorothy Perkins etc. During these process they have made all of the aisles much smaller so less trollies and them stupid dot com wagons just cannot fit. Not only that but the various cages and whatever else hanging about.  Then I went down the chocolate aisle and one of the boxes fell off the shelf (minor accident) not a problem and I picked them up. What stunned me was the manager in the stripy shirt who turned round looked at me and walked off  no offer of help. Then go to the bread aisle  dot com trolley picking bread  the guy picked up one loaf decided it was the wrong one and just shoved it on any shelf  did this three times. Slightly disappointing. I ve held out over these past few weeks while the store is in absolute chaos but I think I m done now and this will be my last shop here.					2016-11-12T10:59:36+0000	1478948376	2016-11-12 11:59:36	2	9	2	0	11	8	3	5	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

There approximately 10 spaces and I often see them being used by people with no children simply because its directly in front of the store. I have a 5 month old child and regularly have to park in normal spaces because people are lazy  when I have that rare time when i am child free i use the appropriate spaces. I am not saying we are more important than disabled people (their need is of course greater) but there does seem to be an abundance of spaces for them and not a realistic or comparable amount for parents.   Your reply would be gratefully received.					2016-11-11T23:12:38+0000	1478905958	2016-11-12 00:12:38	18	14	19	1	34	14	6	8	7	0	18	1	0	0	0	0	0

But weighing them the first one was 60g and the second which i got a picture if was 50g with loads of cream still in the box. For a lot of people this would be a good thing but add someone really trying to lose weight things like this really don t help  luckily I weighed it so only ate half but I know of lots of people who ready these thinking they are 117cals in total. You need to either change the wording or correct the weights.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14991926_10154714524559670_3490593022452344749_n.jpg?oh=5cc640c93ae835a968eb5a7db96cea90&oe=591F1B53	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14991926_10154714524559670_3490593022452344749_n.jpg?oh=80c2ad9d94d50726278d5ea90cbca4f6&oe=58E075B5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154714524559670&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-11T23:11:45+0000	1478905905	2016-11-12 00:11:45	1	7	1	0	8	7	3	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Nobody phoned so my mum contacted the number on her receipt today only to be informed that they had not received the order  this is poor customer  service. This should not have happened tesco. I had to contact tesco direct this afternoon and they had to repeat the order  hopefully this order will be processed successfully Having to wait this long for a new washing machine is unacceptable and I am very disappointed with your service to date let alone the inconvenience this has caused to my family. Come on Tesco this needs sorting out asap!!					2016-11-11T22:28:19+0000	1478903299	2016-11-11 23:28:19	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Thank GOD you had a 48 piece tool set on hand so I could rectify the situation immediately.   With everything that is happening in the current climate I expect a company like Tesco to be more enlightened. Gardening isn t just for men and hot water bottles aren t just for women.   Cultivating stereotypes to push products is deplorable and Tesco should know better. In the future  stick with the gifts and leave the labels to us.

I ring to reschedule my delivery and you say your going to charge my card again! And I have to wait 5 days for a refund on my original order.... So you want £90x 2 and I have no shopping... Not likely. How about you cancel my delivery saver account and my shopping account  give me my refund as quickly as you took it.

An accident with a bottle of bleach on Tuesday led me to contact them.  The Dingwall store team replaced affected products in my trolley but when i got home discovered my Ness Bodywarmer had been splashed and some foods affected.   I e-mailed customer services who telephoned and e-mailed me next day and advised on my course of action.   I heard again from them the following day both by phone and e-mail and today got complete compensation for my bodywarmer.   Thank you Tesco - your customer service is second to none					2016-11-11T20:23:41+0000	1478895821	2016-11-11 21:23:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The bread has been unavailable for a couple of weeks and now reappeared as a new recipe. However  whilst the previous loaf was excellent and great value for gluten free bread at £2  the new version is totally tasteless  very stodgy and solid and the slices are about two thirds of the size  whilst the weight I believe is the same  which show how heavy each slice is. Tesco always ask for feedback  good or bad and on this occasion I can only say the new recipe is disastrous! Increasing number of us now buy gluten free bread either because of coeliac disease like myself  or other intolerances and I know many people who are extremely disappointed. I would welcome your comments on this matter. How about reverting back to the original recipe? If not I m afraid I will be purchasing a different brand in future. Photo below shows barcode so we are clear on the product but I have heard similar tales regarding the white and brown loaves too.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14980837_10154623459521411_5222246719956204346_n.jpg?oh=1d8829545332fe8b0df94bdaeaf6a47e&oe=58E8FAFD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14980837_10154623459521411_5222246719956204346_n.jpg?oh=be7f7808979fe27285c41eae1dbf5dce&oe=58E884F0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154623459521411&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-11T20:16:17+0000	1478895377	2016-11-11 21:16:17	3	5	4	0	9	5	2	3	2	0	3	0	0	0	1	0	0

My faith in humanity is well and truly restored! Ava  my 5 year old daughter  has made friends with the man who delivers our Tesco shopping. She absolutely adores him and they always have a lovely chat if she is at home when he comes and they really make each other laugh. Today she was at school when he came. He asked after her and I told him about all the blood tests she has had and her horrific nosebleeds and how very brave she has been. He was very sad to hear she wasn t well. Later on in the afternoon he came back to tell her that he and his friends at work thought she was so brave and a bit of a hero and presented her with a giant tub of Cadburys  Heroes as a gift from them. Robbie  the tall Tesco man    Ava is so happy and I am sorry I cried 😊 Good people do still exist!  I think Robbie deserves a Christmas bonus.

I just drop my wife off there and then drive through the Silverburn car park to the Debenham entrance as there is a fantastic stall outside their excellent shop that sells these marvellous cheese pretzels  which my daughter and I can t get enough of. Then when our business is concluded we drive back to the Tesco car park to pick up my wife   your car park is always so crowded   then we leave by the same route as we entered. In order that you don t make the same mistake again we will endeavour to avoid all your shops because let s face it who can afford £70 on top of your extortionate prices. Now we are on the subject of cars I think my Tesco car insurance is up for renewal   need to get on that right away. Ps. I don t want to nit pick but you also spelled my name wrong it is not  customer   it s  ex customer 					2016-11-11T18:45:07+0000	1478889907	2016-11-11 19:45:07	6	9	6	1	16	8	2	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Decided to visit In store cafe  after all it was DINNERTIME and we were hungry. I was informed  along with the lovely old lady in front of me  that that stop serving hot food  ie pretty much their menu at 5pm so they can get tidied down so they can leave at six.  Ultimately we all left bemused why a cafe would stop serving at a prime time of day  little pee d off because the guy on the counter was pretty unfriendly and more concerned he could get out the door on time and more than anything HUNGRY.  I can not understand why A) Tesco Cafe would want to lose trade  and money in the till? B)  other cafes in Tesco s stay open till 7 and serve until 6.45  I know this as my wife s grandmother works in one.  C)  bother displaying opening times as they in effect close at 5 not 6pm as stated? D) think is acceptable to offer people who want a hot cooked meal  a cake or crisps as a substitute?  I like Tesco  we shop there regularly  its local and selection of products of goods is great. But this Cafe takes the biscuit  which ironically is pretty much what you can get in there at dinnertime.					2016-11-11T18:18:40+0000	1478888320	2016-11-11 19:18:40	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

I phoned Tesco help line and told him he was stuck who got a tow truck on their way.  I then drove back to tell him but he had walked off to find a signal! I then took the vans location and passed it back to Tesco s who got the tow truck on its way.

After a long day at work I went into your store and bought this takeaway pizza.  At the checkout I was understandably  shocked to see that it did not fit into one of your 5p carrier bags. (See fork for scale)  Thus  I had to carry it home in my left hand as my right was busy with my Tesco bag.   Not only did I have to deal with the mocking glances from the public - but when I got home all my pepperoni had migrated south.  May I suggest either you make larger 5p bags or affix a handle so that no one has to suffer with this problem again?   Kindest regards.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14947570_10154182779509503_1669712064377123219_n.jpg?oh=2e65b4ab8116de7aa40665d8696595fb&oe=58E744FC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q81/p720x720/14947570_10154182779509503_1669712064377123219_n.jpg?oh=526c56972f2c98e9e7e0fc1aa2a457f1&oe=59193709	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154182779509503&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-11T17:58:50+0000	1478887130	2016-11-11 18:58:50	11	11	18	0	29	11	4	7	28	0	11	0	0	7	0	0	0

At the checkout  I was asked whether I wanted a bag. I said I d got one. The lady at the checkout asked me whether it was an old one or a new one. I was puzzled by her question  being naive not knowing why she felt the need to ask me such question. I replied that it was an old one. She then gave me a disapproving look and was unfriendly to me. That was when I started to realise that she must have thought I stole the bag! I am a very neat person and I always fold my bag for life neatly and nicely. Yes  it looks nice and new. I felt so insulted  but too embarrassed to say anything. Do  your staff really need to treat a customer like that? Do I have to make sure that next time I walk into Tesco  I have to use my Sainsbury s bag-which  again  is folded neatly- so that I won t be rudely treated like I was a thief?					2016-11-11T17:58:32+0000	1478887112	2016-11-11 18:58:32	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apparently customers get free parking if they spend £5 in store  but this does not include tobacco  lottery or baby milk.   This is incredible. A £5 spend is £5  whatever it is spent on. Why does Tesco feel it has any right to tell parents what milk is acceptable? Apparently this is something to do with British law and not being seen to promote formula feeding.  Shops are retailers  not moral guardians. If they really think formula milk (or tobacco and lottery tickets) are unacceptable  maybe they shouldn t sell them. And let us go to shops that do want to sell them.					2016-11-11T15:53:29+0000	1478879609	2016-11-11 16:53:29	4	12	4	0	16	11	10	1	21	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got to the checkouts with a huge heavy trolley  2 toddlers and a grumpy baby  who wanted to be carried. I was taken to a new till  one lady put my shopping onto the conveyer belt  getting the toddlers to join in. Another lady scanned my shopping and packed it for me. When my 2 year old dropped a glass candle  the staff quickly cleaned up the mess  comforted my daughter and offered to get me a new one. I didn t feel rushed or stressed like I normally do when shopping with the kids  so thank you  it really made a difference to my day 😊					2016-11-11T15:03:20+0000	1478876600	2016-11-11 16:03:20	2	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

There are questions that would need an application of logic and also other factors to take into consideration e.g. Why it s actually busy  types of customers  how full the shelves are to help customers/colleagues and various other examples.  I don t feel it s fair and isn t a good and accurate way to test potential employees. I m a loyal Tesco shopper and thought working for Tesco while studying would be ideal for me but I felt let down by the generic questions that would have other factors embedded into it.					2016-11-11T14:52:59+0000	1478875979	2016-11-11 15:52:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an online order to be delivered as usual between 6-7 tonight.  I have had a call saying a system error means my order has been cancelled. Not only is it canceled but I have been charged over £100 and won t receive my refund for 3-5 working days. I can of course reschedule this order but will be required to pay AGAIN for it. So I m left with no shopping and no money to get some. I have had lengthy conversations with customer services and some token gestures have been offered but they are NOT good enough. Apparently this should never have happened and it s not my fault. But quite frankly it has happened and the solution offered is not good enough. I order online for convenience and now I am going to be out of pocket and severely inconvenienced. Tescos this is appalling service and I won t let this rest until I have a solution I m actually happy with.					2016-11-11T14:30:34+0000	1478874634	2016-11-11 15:30:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I choose to shop with Tesco and collect points on my ClubCard the thought that I being rewarded makes the shopping trip less hard.  This year I’ve save up all my vouchers and then  when I had a nice amount to spend I decided to treat my little daughter to a snazzy little friend.   I ordered her a BeatBot Belle and we chose to collect in store because we’re busy girls and did not want to miss her arriving at our door.  The text came through to say that BeatBot Belle was waiting  please come and get her and so when we had the time to spare we drove to the store together.   When we got BeatBot Belle home  we opened her that night  it didn’t take us very long to discover that something was not right   I’m handy  so I took her to the kitchen to start a full investigation the batteries had leaked!  I didn’t want to complain or cause frustration to my little girl (who at 15 months does not much enjoy waiting)  So I cleaned the chamber and changed the batteries with no hesitating.  BeatBot Belle sprung into life but still  there was something wrong BeatrBot Belle couldn’t make it to the end of any of her songs. Now to most parents this will seem a blessing  these toys – they do go on... and you seem to spend your whole life humming along to their song   and you wonder with all the new tunes that get lodged inside you head  what information are you losing to make space for them instead?!  But that’s not the point  I really couldn’t let this baby of mine  have a counting toy that gives up once it gets to number 9; It seems that battery acid has probably been the downfall of this toy   and so I took to twitter and spoke to a friendly  helpful boy  who said he would order a replacement that would be delivered the next day  between 7am and 7pm and they’d take the old BeatBot Belle away.  A 12 hour window is not ideal when you’re two girls who like to get out and play but I made provisions to keep a 15 month old entertained at home for one whole day. Imagine the disappointment at 7:30pm when it became quite clear  that on that day a delivery was not taking place here.   Again took to twitter looking for someone to shed some light  that is when I saw there had been a problem  there was a problem with order placed last night.An insincere  ‘apologies you were not informed’ I was told - Clearly this lady has not spend a day with a cabin-fevered 15 month old!  The order has been re-made and after 3pm this afternoon we should be able to collect our new BeatBot Belle and give the poor  confused one back to you  …But what really does upset is not the problem but the way that the customer service agent dealt with me that day. It was expected that today I’d want to wait in for a potential 12 hour slot without any hope or confidence that we would not be forgot. And that no real apology was offered for our wasted time and so that’s the real reason of this (not to little rhyme).  I asked 3 times for an official place where I could formally complain   each time the ladies answer to me was always just the same  that she will feed my comments back  I said I wanted to do it personally but 3 times she failed to provide those contact details for me.  A toy leaking battery acid is not ideal but its one of those things that you can’t prevent but you can stop unapologetic  unhelpful messages been sent.   A wasted day to your colleagues may not seem like a big deal   but unfortunately that is not the same way that I personally feel.   And so I’ve turned to facebook to voice my sincere displeasure  and hope that someone will get back to me  of course  within their leisure…					2016-11-11T14:24:54+0000	1478874294	2016-11-11 15:24:54	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As an adult sometimes you have to do things that you really do not fancy   like for example grocery shopping if you don’t want an empty pantry  and though the thought of pushing around a heavy trolley is a bore    it’s not my favourite past time  but it’s a necessary ‘adulting’ chore. I choose to shop with Tesco and collect points on my ClubCard the thought that I being rewarded makes the shopping trip less hard. This year I’ve save up all my vouchers and then  when I had a nice amount to spend I decided to treat my little daughter to a snazzy little friend.   I ordered her a BeatBot Belle and we chose to collect in store because we’re busy girls and did not want to miss her arriving at our door.  The text came through to say that BeatBot Belle was waiting  please come and get her and so when we had the time to spare we drove to the store together.   When we got BeatBot Belle home  we opened her that night  it didn’t take us very long to discover that something was not right   I’m handy  so I took her to the kitchen to start a full investigation the batteries had leaked!  I didn’t want to complain or cause frustration to my little girl (who at 15 months does not much enjoy waiting)  So I cleaned the chamber and changed the batteries with no hesitating. BeatBot Belle sprung into life but still  there was something wrong BeatrBot Belle couldn’t make it to the end of any of her songs. Now to most parents this will seem a blessing  these toys – they do go  and you seem to spend your whole life humming along to their song   and you wonder with all the new tunes that get lodged inside you head  what information are you losing to make space for them instead?!  But that’s not the point  I really couldn’t let this baby of mine  have a counting toy that gives up once it gets to number 9; It seems that battery acid has probably been the downfall of this toy   and so I took to twitter and spoke to a friendly  helpful boy  who said he would order a replacement that would be delivered the next day  between 7am and 7pm and they’d take the old BeatBot Belle away. A 12 hour window is not ideal when you’re two girls who like to get out and play but I made provisions to keep a 15 month old entertained at home for one whole day. Imagine the disappointment at 7:30pm when it became quite clear  that on that day a delivery was not taking place here.  Again took to twitter looking for someone to shed some light  that is when I saw there had been a problem  there was a problem with order placed last night. An insincere  ‘apologies you were not informed’ I was told - Clearly this lady has not spend a day with a cabin-fevered 15 month old!  The order has been re-made and after 3pm this afternoon we should be able to collect our new BeatBot Belle and give the poor  confused one back to you  …But what really does upset is not the problem but the way that the customer service agent dealt with me that day. It was expected that today I’d want to wait in for a potential 12 hour slot without any hope or confidence that we would not be forgot. And that no real apology was offered for our wasted time and so that’s the real reason of this (not to little rhyme). I asked 3 times for an official place where I could formally complain   each time the ladies answer to me was always just the same  that she will feed my comments back  I said I wanted to do it personally but 3 times she failed to provide those contact details for me.  A toy leaking battery acid is not ideal but its one of those things that you can’t prevent but you can stop unapologetic  unhelpful messages been sent.   A wasted day to your colleagues may not seem like a big deal   but unfortunately that is not the same way that I personally feel.  And so I’ve turned to facebook to voice my sincere displeasure  and hope that someone will get back to me  of course  within their leisure…					2016-11-11T13:42:18+0000	1478871738	2016-11-11 14:42:18	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I told the checkout assistant who was crewing gum and appeared not interested. 10/15mins another said no these are not discounted  he didn t even check.i wasn t gonna hang around agree over 50p  i knew i was right but paid and left. Yesterday back in the store  the same items  still in same place still marked discounted. There appears to be little customer service these days in store. I ve used photo section when my photos appeared far to yellow and nobody helped. I m sorry to write but this happened few time. Yestersay in the quick checkout the assistant was screaming  here  loudly instead of next please. Idk maybe that s how it is now  crew gum and be loud.					2016-11-11T09:54:14+0000	1478858054	2016-11-11 10:54:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m fed up of waiting to be served while your employees finish their conversations with their colleagues!  I m fed up of the awkwardness and unwelcomeness I receive from the customer service counter! Surely these should be your most experienced staff?! Moaning about other departments while I m stood at the counter.  I get made to feel like a criminal and I have to offer your staff solutions to my issues I have! Surely it should be the other way round?  Tesco Sunbury is the most miserable experience ever.  I ve worked in customer service for over 20 years we all have bad days... but it feels like it is constant bad days at Tesco Sunbury!					2016-11-11T09:25:05+0000	1478856305	2016-11-11 10:25:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

If so  this is disgusting and I am horrified that an influential chain like yourselves do not do the simple gesture of providing the chance for your customers to donate and get a poppy. A small sacrifice for the lives that were lost fighting for our tomorrow.

The reason for me asking is that yesterday I picked up a box of normal strepsils whilst at the checkout only to be told they were refusing to sell me them as they had to be dispensed by a pharmacist.  I have never heard such rubbish. Even a supervisor was called who agreed with me but still said that s what the till was showing so couldn t help me.  I asked them to bring the pharmacist to the checkout - this was refused.  What they wanted me to do was purchase my shopping and then come back into store  pick up the strepsils from the checkout  queue at the pharmacy and then purchase items.  #dissappointedagain					2016-11-11T07:49:05+0000	1478850545	2016-11-11 08:49:05	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tescos support Alzheimers charities but obviously are not empathic to the suffers! To ban a gentleman for 3 months over a newspaper which he didn t realise he hadn t paid for. Your staff who handled this situation are poor examples of decent human beings.

She was told that they didn t know what she was on about and the they walked off. The second member of staff she asked said  I m sorry I can t leave what I m doing to help look because we re timed on our work . And after working in Marks and Spencer for most of her life my mum was rather shocked by the bad service she received.

I rang him but his phone had died and it was the only number I could remember. The staff at customer services (Burnley) kindly rang a taxi and paid for it!

I ve had nothing from you for at least 12-14 months. Is it because I m a coeliac and gluten free products are not included... even when I m e-mailed offers you may like they are product s I can t eat.  By the way I travel all the way from back of Runcorn to Widnes to get my GF products from you. They are definitely the nicest so thanks for the growing products					2016-11-10T17:00:49+0000	1478797249	2016-11-10 18:00:49	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to your Fulbourn store today to get a few essentials. This on its own is a task in itself as it is two busses away from where I live but it s much cheaper than my local waitrose.. I used the scan and shop service and as I got to the check out and asked the woman if there was a tag on my scarf as I didn t want to get home and find there was one. She took it away and ran it over the unit thing and said there wasn t a tag in it as it would of beeped.. alas I have got home  and found a big ugly black tag in said scarf. Normally it wouldn t bother me  but I d bought it because I ve got a rotten cold and a twenty minute walk to the school to pick my children up. As I can t easily nip back and get the tag off.. I m now left with a scarf I can t use and I m  £12 out of pocket.. unimpressed.					2016-11-10T13:36:15+0000	1478784975	2016-11-10 14:36:15	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Pulled into one of your car parks this lunch time where a car with four East European men parked straddled across two disabled spaces so I squeezed in  parking very close to them. Asked where is your disabled badge where upon they replied they  were only there a minute . Pointed out to them that did not matter  they still have to have a blue badge. In addition two Tesco staff watched me. I thought Tesco  as a whole organisation were to stop this sort of poor parking practice as an earlier commitment announcement.					2016-11-10T13:20:59+0000	1478784059	2016-11-10 14:20:59	0	10	0	0	10	10	4	6	10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The fire alarm was going off when I entered the store then was turned off   after 5 mins it came on again and an announcement was made to evacuate the store.  Security and staff were blocking the way to the lifts but more importantly the way to the fire exit and were directing people to the stairs and escalators which were crowded at the bottom by people waiting to get back in and no one was at the bottom to stop people coming up the escalator to the store. Why aren t both escalators turned into down mode to empty the store much faster and allow customers to use fire doors.?					2016-11-10T13:19:24+0000	1478783964	2016-11-10 14:19:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only been using them for a month and have had three time slots missed  each time being due to Tesco vans breaking down  (which makes me come to the conclusion that they don t maintain them very well). Tesco send text messages notifications of new arrangements  but with no contact information to talk to anyone. I again make another assumption that this is because they don t want people to ring up and tell them that this is unsatisfactory or inconvenient.   On talking with the customer service department the only option is to either wait for the new time slot that Tesco have chosen or to cancel. They have no capacity to make any amendments on the day that suit us the customer but they can make amendments which suit them. I am not allow to go to store and collect the items  I can t have it rearranged for another slot of my choosing today because that might potential mean that other people might also cancel. Yet the only option that I am getting is to cancel my order for today  because Tesco computer system won t allow for such changes. In other words the computer says no!!!!!    I have chosen home delivery because I have a 6 week old baby and it can be difficult to get to store.   Your customer service is appalling. If you re going to mess with customers plans you need to either  A) have vans that don t keep breaking down  or have some spare to account for break downs. B) allow customers to change to another time slot on the same day that suits them or C) allow people to go and collect it from store instead. Just saying cancelling is a rubbish option which doesn t help your customers.   Overall my 12 month ordering subscription will be cancelled.					2016-11-10T12:20:29+0000	1478780429	2016-11-10 13:20:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  when I logged onto my clubcard account to use these vouchers (or in fact print to take to store)  they were not there. I have contacted general customer service and clubcard customer service and both were unable to help as this is apparently a marketing  situation that they have no access  to. I am reluctant to forget about the vouchers as they actually equated to about £20 in money off vouchers and I find it difficult to believe there is no resend option or anyway to access the codes for me to use. I would be grateful if somebody could look into this and contact me.  Thank you in advance   Myka Dymond					2016-11-10T11:06:39+0000	1478775999	2016-11-10 12:06:39	0	15	0	0	15	15	8	7	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son was sent from the job centre on a retail course  sponcered by Tesco. If he passed  he would be offered three days work experience and a job interview. This he did and was offered work at the Bramley store. He had an induction day  signed forms and has a uniform hanging in his wardrobe. So far so good. Sadly this was in October  he is still waiting to hear from you. He has submitted his right to work documents  to the external company on several occassions  but some how those documents have gone missing. I have spoken to a member of staff from personnel three weeks ago (Wendy Grey) from the Seacroft branch who advised submitting again on another link. Again this has not worked. My so has contacted the store manager on several occasions to no avail. He has suggested applying for a new position using the store managers if code. All in all the experience has been poor  at least one other young adult who passed the course in September has not started work  my son now risks sanctions from his benefit  though he has done nothing wrong  he has done everything asked of him. The store manager at Bramley wants him to work too. Please Tesco  respond to this message  chase and investigate your vetting company  and PLEASE give my son the job he has studied for and won.					2016-11-10T09:36:56+0000	1478770616	2016-11-10 10:36:56	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m highly disappointed at the fact your customer services refused to help out with a discount voucher. We did a shop on 6.11 over £40 but forgot to use our £8 loyalty voucher. Completely Our fault. I asked customer services today if they would honour this. The assistant just kept pointing out the voucher was out of date. It was in date when we made our purchase. The assistant didn t even look at the original receipt. I visit your ballygomartin branch in Belfast 2 to 3 times a week.  And now instead of being a happy loyal customer I m disgruntled and annoyed that for the sake of £8 your staff couldn t have done this as good will!					2016-11-10T06:50:58+0000	1478760658	2016-11-10 07:50:58	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner has had problems with using this service a few times now in problems getting our shopping delivered on a number of occasions and is now beyond a joke. Tonight should of been delivered between 8 and 9pm and at 9:35 still not arrived. Phoned customer services couldn t get in touch with driver or store said they would phone back which they did to re arrange for next day between 4 and 5pm. Still not happy as if we had been informed to say what the reason was then fine but for us to have had to do the getting in touch etc is wrong. We might as well of done the shopping ourselves. Over the last few months we have not had a good service from you regarding this. The cross point Walsgrave tesco store seriously needs to do something about this. This is the 3rd strike now so you re out. No wonder tesco are losing money.					2016-11-09T22:01:56+0000	1478728916	2016-11-09 23:01:56	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I seen a jacket in one of your stores in the Republic of Ireland. The label showed that it was £29 (sterling) or 40 Euro.  However  If I was to change 29 sterling  this would only equate to approximately 31 Euro based on no commission.  So why are your prices considerably higher in the Republic of Ireland?					2016-11-09T21:06:16+0000	1478725576	2016-11-09 22:06:16	0	3	1	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately nothing turned up  after calling at 6.30pm we was told the van had had an accident and we may have to re-book for 6-7pm today  but there was still a possibility that we may get our shopping.  We waited till 9.30pm and called again as time was getting on.  Spoke to a woman who put us on hold to call the store to see if it was coming.  We was told she spoke to the store manager who confirmed they are out on delivery and are definitely coming tonight but with no ETA. 11.30pm came and we gave up and went to bed as I have to be up at 4.30am for work.  We gathered it was re-booked for today at 6-7pm.  Today I was talking to a friend who lives up the road from me  literally 30 seconds drive. He received his tesco shopping yesterday just after 7pm.  So today nothing turned up again.  7.20pm my partner called up to find out where our shopping was. She was told the payment hasn t gone through  after my partner explained you took the money and its gone from our account she was told you take the money but only to refund it which takes 3-5 working days  then you try take it again the next morning. During this process you attempted to take payment 4 times this morning.  When I got home I called up and spoke to someone about the situation who was extremely helpful. He done all he could but unfortunately there was not much he could do without taking more money. Which I have to go to the bank to put in and at 8.15pm isn t possible. He gave me £25 compensation which will also take 3-5 days.  I understand accidents happen  but its how a company as large as yourselves deals with the situation. It happened to me about a year ago with asda  the store manager personally drove her own car to deliver my shopping.  Why do you have a van up the road at 7pm and another down the other end (if it arrived) who plans your routes ? Why refund something and try to retake a matter of hours later but not attempting once but four times.  Your service has been appalling.					2016-11-09T20:54:41+0000	1478724881	2016-11-09 21:54:41	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have spent the time complaining on twitter and at customer service in store where I was assured by the manager that all bags would be removed from sale only to find they were still there the next day. When I complained they were still on sale the person I told didn t care. I can t even think about rice without feeling sick. A £5 voucher (£3.50 compensation as it includes a refund for the rice) and the standardised letter which didn t even cover the issue is a complete joke and unacceptable.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/p130x130/14926277_10157475716505538_7854167592812937216_n.jpg?oh=f011f1e44e07448b5683fbcd77afc00b&oe=591C106A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/14926277_10157475716505538_7854167592812937216_n.jpg?oh=1c7fe2401b6421487d2abf07a6e1f8bd&oe=59189290	https://www.facebook.com/10155688859635538/videos/10157475707865538	facebook.com	2016-11-09T20:43:55+0000	1478724235	2016-11-09 21:43:55	1	8	5	0	13	8	5	3	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	2	0

Apart from the time a wild Pikachu appeared on Pokémon go and quickly evaded me  I really can t remember the last time I was stirred from anything other than a placid temperament  but today I am quite angry.  I m a regular shopper in your express store in Kensal Rise  London  almost daily in fact.  At the weekend I was in there with a couple of friends on the way home from the fireworks. I d stopped to buy tonic water.  After paying I was waiting near the exit  with my friends  for the last of them to finish up at the tills. The security guard approached us and said to me in no uncertain terms that I had NOT paid for my shopping. I was surprised as I d heard the machine beep when I paid with my contactless card. I don t mean to brag but I m no beginner at this paying thing  especially in your Kensal Rise shop. Hell I can even tell you which self service tills are your best option. Till 1 is a good work horse  as is 5 for that matter. 2&3 seem to dance some form of infuriating tango of only being able to accept card payments  and till number 4 normally behaves but sometimes only takes coin  you know  if you re ever in there.  I m digressing. The security guard was insistent I hadn t paid and escorted me back to the tills. Starting to feel a little embarrassed I asked if he was sure I wouldn t be charged twice. Again  he very publicly insisted I hadn t paid. So  with the eyes of the shop on me  I foolishly took out the tonic water from my bag and paid once again.  I asked a final time if the security guard was sure I wouldn t be charged twice  and even more rudely this time  he told me I hadn t been charged once yet.  So  you can imagine my surprise this morning when I checked my online banking to see I have been charged TWICE.  I m not too miffed about the double charging of the 63p slimline tonic water  I ll make my financiers aware of the slip up and we ll power through. I am very displeased at the approach of your staff in the Kensal Rise store though. I was made to feel like a bit of a mug last weekend which I thought was a bit unprofessional at the time. Still  I could have made a mistake with the machines and walked away without paying by accident. Now that it turns out I had done nothing wrong  I feel that your staff should have double checked the records to see if I had paid rather than just accusing me straight off the bat and marching me back to the tills. Surely the self service machines have those capabilities?   Overall  I am unimpressed and thought you ought to know.

Unfortunately I m not sure of his name but... yesterday we had a Tesco delivery arrive whilst I wasn t at home  my mum was looking after my 2yr old son at our house when the delivery arrived. I hadn t placed an order and when it was being unpacked my mum realised as she saw the name on the order and the address. So she told the driver and they packed it back up to take to the correct address. However during the time it was unpacked my little boy saw a Thomas the Tank Engine Magazine and a toy train attached to it and was beside himself when he realised it wasn t his and was going back. Later that evening when we were having dinner and myself and my husband were back  we had a knock at the door... it was the delivery driver from earlier who had bought my little boy another Thomas magazine!  It s not often someone would do something like that nowadays and I just thought he should be recognised for his kindness and thoughtfulness!! I did pop in store today to say thank you but unfortunately we didnt see the name badge so couldn t say for definite who it was.... but thank you!! You made a little boy very very happy 😃😃😃 I also thought with all the negative complaints these days it s  lovely to see not everyone and every company is the same! Well done 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻					2016-11-09T18:14:23+0000	1478715263	2016-11-09 19:14:23	284	14	308	4	326	13	10	3	20	0	281	23	0	1	0	0	0

I was really disappointed to find that my local store  Burnley  doesn t stock the new Oatley custard or creme fraiche whilst other Tescos do.  Then I went to find the violife products only to find two of those no longer in stock!  Many people who are allergic to dairy protein are also allergic to soya. Violife and oatley are two ranges of products safe for us to eat. Please think about stocking them!!!					2016-11-09T17:56:51+0000	1478714211	2016-11-09 18:56:51	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You get home do all the veg make the Yorkshire pudding from scratch.  Its almost time to serve. Your hubby s just walked in after a 11 hour shift starving you open the slow cooker and remove the crackling.   And see this.  I don t whether to cry I throw up.

Since monday (was supposed to be called back this afternoon to no avail) 1.5hours on the phone trying to put through toys to my BFPO address  I am now told that these items are restricted and this is why they are unable to process my order! Then I come off the phone and have to put the whole order through again to deliver to my Mums to then have to pay for it to be delivered again.  So therefore paying postage twice!   So tesco what are not on the restricted items list to deliver to BFPO?? Surely lego / computer games are not restricted items?					2016-11-09T15:53:02+0000	1478706782	2016-11-09 16:53:02	1	5	4	1	10	5	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	2	0

Floating inside the bottle. This is a sealed bottle with the shaker lid built in so not possible for it to have entered the bottle after I bought it. I am VERY concerned as to what I and my children have been consuming from this.  I am reluctant to simply return to my local branch as I strongly believe this should be investigated and potentially others from same stock recalled!  Purchased within last 6 weeks approx.  How do I go about getting this investigated and answered?

Forgive me  I m just a tourist over here and I might not be fully aware of British customs but I m bit surprised how you guys are promoting healthy eating habits.  We re enjoying a couple of days in Canterbury and  you know  tight budget  we decided to visit your store to get a sandwich and a drink. We found the refridgerator and took some fruit juice (£1.19) and a sandwich (£2.20). Together £3.39 and the £3 Meal Deal brings that down to  well  £3. Sounds nice! We went to pay and there - surprise: £6.93 (2 Meal Deals). Uhm... but wasn t it supposed to be £6? The gentleman at the cash desk explained:  That price applies to a complete meal package and yours is not complete. It is a drink + sandwich + snack. You have to choose something more  like a chocolate bar or a bag of crisps.  You must be kidding me? Is this how Tesco promotes healthy eating habits?  Frankly speaking I also don t know how that makes sense   the employee added.  So we took some chocolate bars which we didn t need and which we don t plan to eat soon  but the price went down to £6.  There s so much going on about healthy eating habits  your fellow Englishman Jamie Oliver is a warrior at this area  increasing concerns about obesitas  discussions about sugar tax... and what are you doing? We were happy to spend £6 on 2 juices and 2 sandwiches but had to take chocolate bars as well or pay more.  Please be ashamed of yourselves  go back to school  do your homework again and correct this error (because I want to believe it s something you all just overlooked rather than producers of chocolate bars and crisps bribing you guys to force their products onto consumers).  I hope you (and other readers) will understand I m not crying about £0.93 price difference here...					2016-11-09T11:07:22+0000	1478689642	2016-11-09 12:07:22	0	4	0	1	5	4	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Could i please send a wow to Tesco Gosport 4341. Two of your staff there tonight  Karena and Danny 💗💗💗💗💗 have gone over and above what is expected of customer services. Their kindness had me in tears. I had a home delivery and there was an exchange on some ice cream  my son needs to eat the free from range and without really checking my husband accepted the exchange. however  the exchange ice creams have hazelnuts in which our son is severely allergic to. He is anaphylactic to them and stops breathing which  is as you can only imagine quite difficult so we don t have any nut products in the house. I decided to try and take them back to our local store in Gosport and knowing that the delivery didn t come from them I went up to the counter and explain the situation. Karena and Danny said the situation could be sorted and they would never want to see a little boy sad in the morning  this store doesn t even stock the free from ice creams i was returning!!!  they stop the ones that my son can eat. 😁😁😁😁These two people s kindness is beyond special for a Mummy that find buying food so so difficult for a little boy that just wants to be as normal as possible and eating ice cream 🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦 is one of the things little boys do. So I thank you Tesco for making a mummy and a little boy very very happy. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍					2016-11-09T09:43:14+0000	1478684594	2016-11-09 10:43:14	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It averages around 98p throughout the year so is this hike because you know Christmas bakers are instore for their Christmas cake shopping around now?  I complained to the Manager Golden Hill Bristol  but just got the standard  Nothing to do with us.  Head Office tell us what price to charge  .  Before you say that you dont have much stock of this  I beg to differ.  At your Eastgate Bristol store  I counted 6 full boxes out for sale at the £1.10.

Whilst shopping I heard  Matt  tell someone off for not ringing the bell at the till (Matt was filling the shelves)  so when I got to the till I made sure I did!! Matt didn t come even tho he saw me  I had to call him! He said you need to ring the bell love! I told him I did  it didn t appear to work or is there a sign saying ring the bell! When packing my shopping into my bag I noticed some sherbet which I brought had split  obviously I didn t notice when I picked it up! It had gone over everything in my handbag as I put it in  I wasn t happy so I moaned a bit  didn t get an apology at all. I asked Matt if he would get me another one  he rudely said go and get it yourself  to which I replied  I beg your pardon   i asked again  I was trying to empty my bag of sherbet  I said that s the least you can do considering you put it on the shelf split  he said we didn t put it on the shelf split!! I appreciate it might not of been noticed  but a little help and understanding would of been appreciated. Then I asked to see the manager  no manager in store I was told! Matts colleague then appeared and sniggered behind the till  I caught them both laughing when I came back. I have never been treated with such disrespect  Matt has attitude  I heard the way he spoke to other customers  and your other member of staff turned up at the till just to laugh. It s funny that I have sherbet all over the contents of my handbag is it? I am appalled by your customer service  do you not train your staff??					2016-11-09T07:57:54+0000	1478678274	2016-11-09 08:57:54	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in tesco express at northbourne opposite toby carvery it would of been about 9.30 this morning (6th november) I was in there with my two girls and the push chair and a basket full of shopping. The girls listening wasn t great and I was trying to gather them while shop. Young lad behind the till mousy brown hair must of been 17/18 asked me to give him my basket while he put it all through for me bagged it up for me chatted to me about my day smiled at me and made me feel normal. This may not seem lie much but my anxiety was playing up and I find it hard to leave the house alone with the girls and I just wanted to let this young lad know that him just doing something really small really made my day and made me feel human and I want to thank him and let him know his kindness did not go unnoticed. So if people could share this I m hoping the whole 6 degrees of separation that he will see this xx					2016-11-09T07:47:28+0000	1478677648	2016-11-09 08:47:28	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve never really had a bad word to say but just lately I ve noticed the quality of food has gone down and the dates on food is terrible. I usually do my shopping in store in Redditch but last week I couldn t get in store so I used the online service. My shopping was delivered and my husband was in when it came and he was told about a couple of substitutions but not about the items with a short shelf life. The next day I had to throw quite a bit away. Had we of been told we could have sent the items back.					2016-11-09T07:22:52+0000	1478676172	2016-11-09 08:22:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A whole £4.50 extra? Really annoyed as I checked the price online which I often do for cat food as I like to shop around. Didn t realise that when it said for delivery it really meant  not this price in store  - travelled to your Leeds store to purchase (passing other supermarkets on the way) only to walk in and find it at a higher price. Needless to say I didn t buy it as I was beyond annoyed and felt duped to be honest. Is this kind of pricing approach really necessary? If it is you should make it clearer that the price in store is going to be different. Number 836 of why I no longer shop at Tesco!! No one in this day and age wants to pay 45% more for the same item from the same shop!!! Grrrr!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14956384_963590058500_3349253235697630436_n.jpg?oh=7a14143163ae1308b52c1c77e0aae78c&oe=58D96424	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14956384_963590058500_3349253235697630436_n.jpg?oh=bdc36652474cd7061f2ec07eb187bc74&oe=58E65F62	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=963590058500&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-08T23:38:29+0000	1478648309	2016-11-09 00:38:29	2	5	2	0	7	5	3	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I put in my order yesterday  all went through fine! Checked my account this morning (day of delivery) to see if the money had been taken which it had. Then comes my delivery slot time  no shopping delivery! So I phone up your customer service team & got through to a very rude very unhelpful man who told me there was a problem with my card & my order was on hold..... despite the fact Tesco had already taken my money & was showing as so on my internet banking statement. He then proceeded to hang up. So I called back to be put through to my local store (Buckingham) to be told the same thing. So here I with no money (because Tesco has taken it) & no shopping (because Tesco didn t want to know). Would like to know if anyone within Tesco is willing to help me or are you all unhelpful???					2016-11-08T21:50:48+0000	1478641848	2016-11-08 22:50:48	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However due to hunger this is in the oven being cooked. The anticipation i have for consuming this bread is second to none  however  can you be clearer on your labels to ensure in future i dont expect anything more than the label actually states. I have cheese in the fridge which i could add  but i wont as the time spent adding said cheese to your misslabled product can be better spent watching paint dry or watching the spider in the corner of my kitchen slowly consume a fly.  The guy or girl adding cheese had one job  please address and rectify as this amount of cheese is seriously lacking.

Why is this important?  Plastic cotton bud stems are the number one item of plastic  sewage-related debris on our beaches and rivers [1] - yet retailers could help prevent this by switching the stick from plastic to paper.  In the marine environment  plastics can be eaten by marine life  often with fatal consequences. Plastic is found in the stomachs of Loggerhead Turtles  Seabirds and many species of UK-caught fish. And pieces that don t get eaten break down into microplastics  forming part of a dangerous plastic smog in our seas.  Retailers are listening - earlier this year  Waitrose and Johnson & Johnson announced they d make the change to paper  and the Coop and Marks and Spencers sell paper-stem buds. Now we need to make sure the others do the same.  Tesco  Sainsburys  Boots  ASDA  Morrisons  Lidl  Aldi  Superdrug and Wilko are currently reviewing their policies on cotton buds ... which is why we need to show them how many of us support the switch to paper!  Even paper stem cotton buds shouldn’t be flushed down the loo.

After having a awful experience the week before by a staff member at the same store who was quiet rude to the fact I was using a bag from pets at home Andrew shows that not all staff are like it.

This morning having visited my local 24 hour store all tills were closed and I was left to self scan my families weekly shop. Of which there was so much that the bagging area couldn t cope. It took double the length of time it would have on a till as an assistant had to keep coming over to help. Great start to my busy day thank you Tesco if you advertise a 24 hr service then you should deliver it.					2016-11-08T18:01:54+0000	1478628114	2016-11-08 19:01:54	0	4	0	0	4	4	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m having a chat with some friends and it s getting fairly heated. Can you settle something for me. If someone ears something while shopping then pays for it at the checkout are you ok with it or does it upset you? I m talking water and chocolate bars not grapes and apples.

Never had any problems before. Usually the delivery driver rings my door bell and when I answer I have their smiley face with my first crate of shopping.  I don t answer my phone to unknown numbers (as I m sure most people appreciate as it s usually someone trying to get my PPI back or compensation for thay accident that never happened.)  Not only that but when I rang to enquire about where my delivery was it seemed it was all my fault for not answering my phone.

There were a about 40 of your staff wondering around the ST . NEOTS store today but unfortunately no one has fixed the price checker machine in the store YET  . Guess they are all to busy talking about how to gets us into the Christmas spirit . I just Hate having to go and ask one of the till staff the price of things as the shelf price was unclear . Today it was a notebook   on the shelf it said £1    i thought it was wrong so i had to ask   the price was £4 . Just a bit of difference maybe but for a pensioner it may be the difference between being able to pay for my goods at the til or not and then holding everyone up . Sorry to complain but in future if things are unclear i will buy them elsewhere where the prices are clearly marked . I was always told that the price on the shelf is what you pay   not in your case .					2016-11-08T15:23:35+0000	1478618615	2016-11-08 16:23:35	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After numerous calls  including speaking to Community Champions at two stores and Head office  I was told I was unable to buy/order large quantities of each time even though it was for charity; the bill was for over £320!  After being pushed from pillar to post with contradictory information  and spending all afternoon on the phone  I personally visited and bought some items from the Tesco store at Surry Quays.  This was not ideal as it was a heavy purchase.   You have a large section on charity giving on your website  but were unwilling to help me.  I wasn t asking for a donation but to buy for charity.  Tesco states  ... we are really proud to work with hundreds of charities and local community organisations ... providing support where needed .

Not happy with this from such a reputable supermarket  and I have now got to spend extra time returning them to store for a refund	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14938404_10154253714123795_2338412495610698932_n.jpg?oh=23236089020bbf716c2dafaa21fc7ee9&oe=591BA04E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14938404_10154253714123795_2338412495610698932_n.jpg?oh=06dc0157ccafadb78c58dba96941e7a1&oe=58D62843	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154253714123795&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-08T12:24:01+0000	1478607841	2016-11-08 13:24:01	1	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

I travelled up in the lift with a mum and her toddler son who was not happy at going shopping.  However  his face lit up when Mum promised him he could have a piece of fruit to eat while she was pushing the trolley.  Once again  as has become the norm  there was no fruit on the stand.  Cue one inconsolable child and frustrated mum.  I asked at Customer Services and was told it only gets filled  as and when .  If you really cannot spare a member of staff to keep this stocked up - then surely it would be kinder to remove it and announce you are no longer doing this offer?  Last week there was no fruit in the box on Monday  Tuesday  Thursday or Friday when I was in the store - although  of course  they may have been topped up later.  Just make a decision please!					2016-11-08T12:13:02+0000	1478607182	2016-11-08 13:13:02	2	8	2	0	10	8	4	4	8	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

You know this happens every single year so why not get more in so they don t sell out so quickly!  It s hardly fair on children who cannot have a normal chocolate advent calendar to be told that you will get more in and never do like my little girl! I think it s brilliant that you brought out the milk free selection boxes and I have bought my little girl one of these. But it s not fair on my little girl getting left out when you say your going to have advent calendars and get more in and don t.					2016-11-08T12:09:39+0000	1478606979	2016-11-08 13:09:39	2	5	3	0	8	5	4	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	1	0	0

Had a shopping list with 9 items on it. Total items stocked was 1  bottles of Volvic flavoured water. All other items out of stock. Asked a young lad about one item  who was very helpful. Asked 2 girls about another item  they told me to go to  around aisle 21  to look for it before continuing their chat  apologies for interrupting your conversation girls! Went to Pharmacy to collect my repeat prescription that was sent electronically to them from my GP on 25th October. Was asked to come back for it and they would have it ready. There were 5 staff behind the counter  but they claimed they were short of staff and thats why it wasnt ready. Oh and by the way  I know its important to stock the shelves  but to ignore people waiting then stop the stock up to speak to a staff member that comes to the counter? Think you really need to work on your customer services.					2016-11-08T10:39:31+0000	1478601571	2016-11-08 11:39:31	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was totally unaware of any time limits and assumed  as many would  that this carpark is free like the rest of Silverburns parking. I understand that you do this to deter people using the shopping centre and not going into your store but when we do use it for our Tesco shop aswell  it s a kick in the teeth. On many occasions we park here to go to the shopping centre/cinema and then into Tesco to do our weekly shop. Do you suggest we park further down  have a wander around the shops  go back to the car  then drive up to the top of the carpark where I suppose we must cross the threshold into the  Tesco carpark  to go and do our shop. In this letter it was stated that we had infact gone over the time limit before but were let off. Might I suggest that you ask the company you employ to manage your carpark  to send out a letter the first time informing your customers of their indiscretion and be careful to not let it happen a second time to avoid a fine. You can be assured that we will no longer be using Tesco for our weekly shop. My husband and I have informed our family  friends and colleagues whom we know use Silverburn and Tesco and not one of them knew about this time limit and have told us that they will no longer shop with Tesco. We are really disappointed and feel this a cheap way for you to make money off your customers.					2016-11-08T10:25:18+0000	1478600718	2016-11-08 11:25:18	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We decided to use the handheld scanners and went around scanning all our shopping as we do normally. Everything was fine. We went to the check out with our shopping at roughly 9:15pm. At the check out I was served first for a few bits I d got while my mum queued behind me. A cashier then called my mum over to the next till as there was a large queue behind her. My mum went over to the cashier and I bought my shopping placed it upon the pram and then went over to my mum. As I got there the cashier serving my mum had taken the scanner and then performed  the random check that came up. The cashier then went back to the till and told us the total to pay is£15 something. After being told this my mum replied that the total was not right it should be more. The woman then said very promptly that we hadn t scanned the milk for starters. I told her that I had and there must be some mistake. She then told us we hadn t scanned quite a few of the items (which I knew we had) and was ordered to put all our shopping on the check out. She went through all the items that came up on her display and put them to the side. There were quite a few items that hadn t come up on her display. The cashier then asked Again if we had scanned the items on the handheld scanner in I dubious demeanour  to which I responded that i had checked the scanner myself just before coming to the check out with my mum. She proceeded to call a security guard (1) over. She told him that we hadn t scanned a lot of items through and he questioned me on whether I had in fact actually scanned these so called unscanned items (as I usually use the scanners for my mum with her being a lady of a certain age)  to which I replied that I did. I had checked  the whole list on the display of the scanner after finishing our shopping before proceeding to the check out. I then told them that i could remember the total and it should be £36.70 something. More Tesco workers crowded round us watching what was happening along other shoppers like some sort of big event was happening. This made me and my mum feel extremely  intimated  uncomfortable and embarrassed  worse was us having my 10 month old son asleep with us in his pram. One of the Tesco staff members who came to spectate (after the security guards was summoned) then pointed to my son s pram and said she got all these on her pram. To which I told her I had bought them separately just before my mum and I had the receipt for. She then went quiet and stood next to the cashier and continued to spectate. The security guard (1) then called for another security guard (2) to come talk to us which then made us worried futher. In the meantime the cashier at the check out was turning other customers away saying she had a problem with us  so they were all staring as we had security guards and tesco staff around us. The security guard (2) came and spoke with the cashier. She told him we hadn t scanned the items through in a way that made it sound as though i had done this deliberately to avoid payment for some  of our items  despite the fact of my mum telling the cashier that the total was wrong in the first place and they must be an error when told the shopping came to £15 something. The cashier said I hadn t scanned half the items because they are not showing on her display. The security guard  (2) then asked me if I scanned the items to which again I said that I had and that shopping should total £36.70 something as shown on the scanner before we gave it the cashier. The cashier then inturpted us to asked the security guard (2) if she should proceed to void the sale and let them deal with us to which the security guard (2) then ask her to scan all the items before they  dealed with us  to see what the amount of the shopping totaled to see if what we had said the handheld scanner total had said and unsurprisingly to us when she did this (which she should of done in the first place)  the total of the items came to £36.72. She then asked the security guard (2) what she should do. The security guard (2) said then to the cashier  that it s fine  turned to us for a split second and said the words I m sorry (nothing else) before promptly walking away. The rest of the staff who was watching us like a major event was going on just then all went away. The cashier then apologised to JUST my mum and said she d never known the scanning system to do this before and then finally allowed to purchase our items. We was stopped at your tills for 15-20 minutes whilst this was resolved which led to my mum missing her bus home leaving us with no option to sit on the bench at the end of the check outs where my mum was almost in tears until other travel arrangements was arranged. Not really what I expect when I go to do my shopping with yourselves  and i think it s appalling customer service. For me to have to be made to feel that way with my baby was bad  but my mum is 62 years of age  that is disgraceful........ please feel free to review your cctv where you will see me clearly scanning all items for both me and my mum.					2016-11-08T04:10:46+0000	1478578246	2016-11-08 05:10:46	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst shopping in your lovely Brislington store last week I picked up this rather handsome looking tomato along with five of its pals!  Loose pickings from the small remainder of what were meant to be vine tomatoes!! Carefully I removed the little green stalks and any remaining vines (these dastardly bits can cause havoc to the skin of their pals if a stray vegetable happens to roll upon them whilst I experience a small bit of trolley rage!!) and loaded up my trolley with the rest of my bits and pieces!  I nursed these tomatoes the whole way round the store and made it to the checkout with all six still intact- no stalks and vines you see :) as my goods are bleeping their way through the checkout I happen to look up as the delightful red tommys are being bleeped through and I see the screen says £4.80 - beef tomatoes!!! I said-  they seem like very expensive tomatoes to me and these are not beef tomatoes  to which Mr checkout guy says-  this is the only option I can see on the screen . I trotted off back to where I picked up my six tommys and removed the label from the shelf and took back a proper beef tomato for good measure! Mr checkout guy said-  oh yes- the vine tomatoes- I didn t recognise them because they weren t attached to a vine!   Surely everyone knows a beef tomato is like the Incredible Hulk of the tomato world- obviously not!! Anyway  me and my six tomatoes made it home in one piece and five of them were cooked up into a delicious dish!! This one will form part of a sandwich tomorrow :)  perhaps some lessons to be learnt in tomato knowledge for some and for others- keep your eye on the screen and check the receipt!!   I still love you Tesco and good on you for your  perfectly imperfect  range :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15032190_1759334940983637_9186043914975608148_n.jpg?oh=ee025b094ffdbae91e0e3fc5fecb9581&oe=58E7B34C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15032190_1759334940983637_9186043914975608148_n.jpg?oh=dd784f8044c56dc282b37e5f499830aa&oe=5918D359	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1759334940983637&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-07T21:19:33+0000	1478553573	2016-11-07 22:19:33	5	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	1	0	0	0

I was really pleased when your Wigan Extra store finally started offering free fruit for kids a few weeks back. We had a lovely full box with apples oranges and bananas in. Since that first week  however  this is what the box has looked like every time I ve visited. And  yes  only oranges have been on offer. Clearly a bit unpopular! This photo was taken this morning at around 10.15am. One of the oranges was rotten 😞. Offering initiatives like this is only any good if it s done properly	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14925794_10209936228538248_7679836853832001745_n.jpg?oh=5b6e61a0a529659c4d225aeaccabf838&oe=58D7387E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14925794_10209936228538248_7679836853832001745_n.jpg?oh=de4b2bfb187b1a7412eb079118e89ebb&oe=58DC2573	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209936228538248&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-07T18:03:43+0000	1478541823	2016-11-07 19:03:43	9	4	14	0	18	3	3	0	1	0	9	0	4	0	1	0	0

Purchased them for the new school year and they are already not fit for purpose!  My son began complaining that the heel of his foot was hurting him. Upon closer inspection I realised that the claim you make inside the shoe of  all day comfort  isn t strictly true. I could feel the structure of the shoe beneath the inner sole.  The rip tape fastening are no longer fit for purpose  having come away from the material it s attached to and is now permanently stuck to its adjacent Velcro counterpart! The soles of the shoe are starting to deteriorate too. This morning I ve had to purchase another pair of school shoes for my son  this time reluctantly returning to Clarks and paying £48. I so wanted your school shoes to rival the likes of Clarks and Hush Puppies  unfortunately you have a long way to go.......	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14956363_10154529091765259_2783585709034082815_n.jpg?oh=f0e12c5f6235b6391b471badaa2d5468&oe=59186814	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14956363_10154529091765259_2783585709034082815_n.jpg?oh=002e27fcc82cadea592698b09a251052&oe=58E13419	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154529091765259&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-07T16:10:44+0000	1478535044	2016-11-07 17:10:44	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son who is 3 was having a bit of a meltdown he was tired  fed up and excited for the party. He was in the trolley having a cry while I was trying to  scan my items through the self serve as fast as possible so we could get out before irritating all the other shoppers. One of your sales assistants called James came over and tried to talk to my son  then he disappeared round the tills and came back with a store catalogue filled with toys and stickers to stick on the toys you like. He instantly stopped crying settled down and was engrossed in the pictures of superheroes that James had found. This in itself was great customer service  but James didn t stop there. He asked what fruit Noah liked and ran off to fetch him a banana and told us about their fresh fruit for kids policy. I haven t experienced customer service like this ever before. He is a credit to Tesco and I hope you will thank him again for me  he definitely deserves some kind of recognition.

I only had baby milk to buy so I parked in your store car park; in which you have a new parking system. I made my purchase to be told that this doesn t qualify me for a parking ticket. The threshold for parking is £5  I did not realise you stipulated what I can and cannot purchase in order to pay for parking  The baby milk cost me £11 and therefore I don t understand why this wasn t a large enough purchase. I then had to wait at customer services whilst they insisted it wasn t a purchase that covered the cost of parking. I was eventually given a ticket for parking. However this service is not acceptable for families with newborn babies; when visiting the supermarket is stressful enough!   Feeding my baby is essential and therefore so is the purchase of milk; please can you explain why this vital item is not included ?   I look forward to hearing your answer.					2016-11-07T14:01:12+0000	1478527272	2016-11-07 15:01:12	7	32	12	0	44	31	9	22	23	0	7	0	2	0	0	3	0

Today you let me down. I called up to find out about my order to find out your driver  could not deliver to me ? Seems to be the only one in months who couldn t!

This led to serious problems.  Tesco promised it had a good battery life but it is useless if I cannot rely on it.

I dropped my prescription in at 8am saturday morning. Was told to carry on with my shopping  which i did then told she couldnt find it.  Returned to the store saturday lunchtime  waited in the queue  finally got served then to be told she still couldnt find it and then you had a powercut so had to leave the store again without my prescription.  Returned this morning at 7.56 to be told sorry we dont open til 8 and again couldnt have my prescription. The store is also so higgledi piggeldi in its layout and now difficult to find anything and do the staff actually fill up the ready made sandwiches as the choice is alot of the time absolutely dire.   Not impressed at all and am thinkin of starting my shopping traps to morrisons. I have used your store for god knows how many years.					2016-11-07T08:09:10+0000	1478506150	2016-11-07 09:09:10	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I paid by card. The lady did not tell me the price so I just placed card into machine and entered pin. Upon reviewing the receipt later I found I had been charged 5.25 too much. There appears to be a transaction  for 7 bags of Monster Munch at the top of the receipt. There is then a Total for this of £5.25. Following this is my actual transaction the total of which has been combined with the Monster Munch. I did not purchase any Monster Munch (CCTV will confirm this) and I am quite angry to be charged over £5 for something that is not mine. Please advise how I go getting my money back?? Thanks in advance. Helen					2016-11-07T04:59:40+0000	1478494780	2016-11-07 05:59:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I always have this problem only in Tesco  this never happens at Asda after 8pm. This pushes customers away and your store loses out on £64. Please sort this out because not everyone can come in before 8pm.					2016-11-07T01:02:42+0000	1478480562	2016-11-07 02:02:42	0	6	0	0	6	6	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s the beginning off November!  Which other religious event do you start publishing 7 wks before the event.  How about this?  Instead of encouraging over excess and debt this year you play it down?  For the people who are on their own   don t like Christmas or have lost loved ones?  For the people who want to shop without having constant irritating   jangly background music.  A haven instead of a hell?  But you won t cause it s all about money.  Not really the true Christmas spirit.... Is it?					2016-11-06T23:38:50+0000	1478475530	2016-11-07 00:38:50	1	12	1	0	13	12	3	9	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had just got to a til and was about to load my shopping onto the conveyor belt when my 2 year old said he needed the toilet. I was about to take him and the trolley away when the lady working on the til said  don t worry  leave the trolley  take him and I ll put it all through for you and keep it here . When we got back it was all packed up and she just recalled the transaction for us to pay. It was such a kind gesture and so helpful when with a potty-training toddler! I think her name was Jeanette and she was a star ⭐️ I hope this can be passed on to the store  thank you.					2016-11-06T23:14:26+0000	1478474066	2016-11-07 00:14:26	33	7	35	1	43	7	1	6	2	0	33	2	0	0	0	0	0

I wait the whole time  I call Customer service and pay dearly  wait on hold  only to find out that there were delays and they wouldn t deliver my order  even though I insisted I could wait any time. What s more  my order is cancelled  I have no food for my kid for the following week  I have to finda way of shopping after work   and I will have to wait for the refund  2 or 3 days  just like the previous times. I am writing to enquire about Tesco s policy in this cases. If there is delay  is the policy not to notify the customer  not to deliver and to cancel the order?

At the first glance I get excited seeing cakes and sweet snacks which I ve never been able to eat. But then I get really disappointed when it soley says gluten free and wheat free on the packaging and find that its not actually dairy free.  I m sure alot of other people feel like this. To be honest I shop more in Sainsburys and Asda for freefrom products because I feel like they actually have products which are both gluten and dairy free. That way no one is dissappointed.  I think Tesco need to do this too! You need make your freefrom products completely free from gluten and dairy. You ll appeal to more people that way. This goes for your Tesco finest gluten free range too  it would be nice if they were dairy free. Let me know what you think of my feedback.

Out of a pack of 32 (I think) 8 have torn whilst pulling them up on my daughter. Poor quality and we have never had this problem with other brand pull ups. I ve added a picture below showing where the pull up is tearing  the part that is supposed to tear when u take the pull up off isn t tearing it s the seam at the front of the nappie. They just seem to be very poor quality and I won t be wasting money on these again and will post to other parent forums warning them too.  In the picture below my thumb is on the part that you tear when taking the nappie off. These are tearing when we try and put them on my daughter.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14991807_10154347072094681_512796914722755865_n.jpg?oh=cf6f380c77106f2292f8840e865d8c7d&oe=58D89A9E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14991807_10154347072094681_512796914722755865_n.jpg?oh=2e5b2a4bfcc1a47e5e400667cfaef3eb&oe=591B618B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154347072094681&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-06T21:37:00+0000	1478468220	2016-11-06 22:37:00	7	3	7	1	11	3	2	1	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

You should really get rid of that sad pair of comedy actors by the way.....they are cringeworthy!  No groups of staff stood talking and blocking the aisles! When they are supposed to be restocking shelves!  No green trolley shoppers....not one....your having a laugh! You can t move for the stupid things at your Oak Tree store!  As your open for 24hrs.... can t they do these useless menial tasks late at night instead of annoying shoppers at the busiest time of the day.

I was in tesco express at northbourne opposite toby carvery it would of been about 9.30 this morning (6th october) I was in there with my two girls and the push chair and a basket full of shopping. The girls listening wasn t great and I was trying to gather them while shop. Young lad behind the till mousy brown hair must of been 17/18 asked me to give him my basket while he put it all through for me bagged it up for me chatted to me about my day smiled at me and made me feel normal. This may not seem lie much but my anxiety was playing up and I find it hard to leave the house alone with the girls and I just wanted to let this young lad know that him just doing something really small really made my day and made me feel human and I want to thank him and let him know his kindness did not go unnoticed. So if people could share this I m hoping the whole 6 degrees of separation that he will see this xx					2016-11-06T20:57:18+0000	1478465838	2016-11-06 21:57:18	5	6	5	1	12	6	1	5	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only it won t scan apparently it is not in the system so they cannot sell it to me. What a load of rubbish it clearly had a price on the shelf yet staff could not deal with it.

I don t like this as much as the  Peya the Parrot  or  Bodo the Bear  ones and I wondered if you could please tell me if they will be back in stock anytime soon? I find that sometimes in stores the vegetarian sweet options can be quite limited and I was quite impressed to see that Tesco stocked these. It would be such a shame if they were no longer available to buy from your store as they are so nice.

Went to West Durrington on saturday morning at 8.30am. Down the potato and onion aisle alone there were 11 pickers. Could not get through! I work for another supermarket. ..

Couldn t believe the packaging involved for such a small box.  I think you need to address this level of packaging and the amount of paper and cardboard involved to package such a small item.    I ordered the same size of advent calendar from Amazon and it was delivered in a flat package with minimal waste packaging while the product was still secure and protected.

After a fab makeover just a few years ago  the department tills made purchasing and exchanging clothes a much better experience. I believe the decision to remove the tills and force customers to purchase clothes at the checkouts and queue at customer services for exchanges and refunds to be a step backwards and a very bad move. Sending my sympathies to the long term F&F staff who have been made redundant as a result.					2016-11-06T19:05:56+0000	1478459156	2016-11-06 20:05:56	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These are sold off the shelf  not over the pharmacy counter (OTC) or by prescription only (POM).  I needed 4 packs and there were only two  damaged packs on the shelf in the aisle.  But there were multiple  undamaged packs behind the counter in the pharmacy. I needed these for my dog  who is on high doses on corticosteroids (prednisolone) due to an autoimmune disease and the vet told me I could purchase these off the shelf in any large supermarket at a fraction of the price she would have to charge. BUT  the pharmacist refused to sell me exactly the same  undamaged packs because it was  against pharmacy regulations . So  Tesco  why did your pharmacy technician refuse to let me buy a product that you were already stocking on the shelves in your aisle? This makes no sense at all and is certainly NOT against pharmacy regulations.  GROWL......					2016-11-06T18:57:34+0000	1478458654	2016-11-06 19:57:34	0	12	0	0	12	11	3	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Imagine my surprise when I was informed by my parents that I was  too old  for a birthday cake! After celebrating with my friends this weekend I returned home and decided to nip to Tesco to buy myself a cake just for me! Because I was in such a bad mood I ran in to the shop grabbed a cake off the shelf and some chocolate and came home for my tea. After eating my tea I decided to cut myself a nice piece of my Paw Patrol cake but on taking a bite I realised it was stale and hard.  Immediately I checked the date on the box and it was the 13th November so I had at least another week to eat my cake! On closer inspection I found a hole the size of a finger that has obviously let air into the box and made my cake stale 😢 Happy Birthday to me From Tesco 😫😫😫					2016-11-06T18:07:56+0000	1478455676	2016-11-06 19:07:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The Waitrose is over 25 miles away  but the service and products are fabulous.  The Tesco Express is a ten minute walk away  and I only buy bits and bobs as needed.  I so wish I had an alternative to Tesco in the village.  Anything other than Tesco!					2016-11-06T17:00:05+0000	1478451605	2016-11-06 18:00:05	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

My husband visited again today and was told that no-one has told them. I contacted your head office over 3 months ago and was assured it would be sorted.  I feel that I should let your customers know that if you were to have a heart attack in a Tesco store  you may not be able to be saved as Tesco s goes months without checking their equipment and ignore people when it s pointed out to them. I will also be contacting the ambulance service to inform them.					2016-11-06T16:53:38+0000	1478451218	2016-11-06 17:53:38	3	4	3	0	7	4	1	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon removing the packaging I discovered that all the skin has been cut/torn away around the neck cavity so it cannot be stuffed. I ve encountered this problem several times before and I don t understand why the packaging/label has to cover up this part of the bird so there is no way of telling if it has been properly prepared until it is unwrapped. I don t have time to make a 10 mile round trip to get it replaced and there would be no way of knowing if the replacement was the same anyway. It might not seem like a big deal but the stuffing is the part the children enjoy the most and Sunday dinner with grumpy kids is no fun at all.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14925268_10210193543410999_5058153023102298594_n.jpg?oh=4b723dec2cc2209a939601fc0291c8c8&oe=58E41E6F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14925268_10210193543410999_5058153023102298594_n.jpg?oh=c9308b6d9b576f87e3beb4be6b68ff7f&oe=5920C762	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210193543410999&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-06T16:21:01+0000	1478449261	2016-11-06 17:21:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know  she thought I’ll warm my tum with a fine gf spiced pear pie. So off she flew in the cold  cold wind across Tescoland to the extra store in Corstorphine. Yes  boxes in plenty were stacked on the shelf. The fairy was happy with the thought of a full tum.   But no! shouted the fairy  the first box was a week out of date. Never mind thought the fairy  boxes were still on the shelf. She tried another one  and another. On and on the fairy laboured but all of the boxes were well out of date. The fairy was feeling weaker and weaker  she needed food to fill her small tum. Oh thought the fairy  I know what I’ll do. A nice toasted gf bagel will suit just as well. She turned to the shelf  but alas and alack that shelf was as empty as her poor rumbling tum. Getting weaker and weaker she had a last thought  a gf chocolate muffin could do the trick. With tears in her eyes she reached for the shelf  but not one gf muffin was in sight..No gf muffins  no gf bagels and only pear pies that were out of date.   The tears started running  what would she do now. And then through the hunger a dim light arose. Back across Tescoland she would go. So to the Broughton Tesco she flew  her wings flapping slower and slower.   Yes there were the gf pear pies all lined up on the shelf. She felt stronger and stronger at the thought of the warm spicy pears in her tum. But no  surely it couldn’t happen twice in one day. The first packet was out of date by two days  and the next and the next and the next more than week out of date. Surely there must be a packet to be had that was still in date.   Oh goodness what could she do know  her energy was low and the thought of trying a third Tesco Leith seemed too much to bear but then as her thoughts started to turn to the closest rival store she reached up on her very tiptoes and right at the back behind all of the boxes  she found just one box with at least one day left on its date. She took the box and flew from the store  home  home she thought and warmed up the pie almost as rare as gold dust.    As she ate it she thought  please  please Tescoland  I may be gf but I get as hungry as everyone else  please keep your stocks up to date or one day all the gf fairies will shop elsewhere for their favourite free from food.					2016-11-06T15:29:01+0000	1478446141	2016-11-06 16:29:01	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This pathetic  half empty 3 shelf section is the extent of their efforts (with the 4th shelf abandoned for some normal bread). There s clearly been no effort to coordinate what s on offer  or make the shelves hold staple essentials. This has all the feel of  head office say we have to have a section for fussy eaters so this should tick that box . Really poor Tesco s  especially when your other stores do Free From so well!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14963143_10157739313615717_2730016825211122152_n.jpg?oh=8c407c1edbb478534431adc52cc8d589&oe=58DFF1B1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14963143_10157739313615717_2730016825211122152_n.jpg?oh=51e25784db4916923e22965c3878bb9e&oe=58E564C5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157739313615717&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-06T14:14:07+0000	1478441647	2016-11-06 15:14:07	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve found grass  nicely washed in with my watercress  then two other types of leaves in another bag  but this time it s what looks n feels like the inside of a snail shell...and it was in my tin of peas...do Tesco not have quality control  or hygiene in place?  the occasional mishap maybe  but come on  how did a snail shell get in a tin of peas  and more worryingly where is the rest of the shell and the snail? It s always been convenient to shop with Tesco  especially with home delivery  but I m beginning to think that maybe it would be safer and better for my health to shop elsewhere! come on Tesco...sort yourselves out!!					2016-11-06T13:07:13+0000	1478437633	2016-11-06 14:07:13	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the children s section of your Shrewsbury store is a Troll sleep mask. My little girl picked it up excited as she loves the brand only for me to find this label on the back.  Not suitable for children adult product . Can you please explain. If it s deemed as a risk to children then perhaps you should not sell it. Or relocate it to the adult section  which of course would be rather odd. Thank you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14915332_10209940017970749_4381931441118019184_n.jpg?oh=e03d94bb3794857c06a9295061a16f10&oe=58E8ED13	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/14915332_10209940017970749_4381931441118019184_n.jpg?oh=f652487b8e291161d441eead68af5422&oe=58EB4900	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209940017970749&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-06T13:02:08+0000	1478437328	2016-11-06 14:02:08	4	14	5	1	20	13	8	5	4	0	3	0	0	1	0	0	0

They send me vouchers for money off which don t work. Got onto Tesco direct as I wanted to place an order.... they said they could refund the £4 discount I would have got this week. What about last weeks £6?  says I. Oh you will have to talk to Clubcard they can reissue voucher. Hmm  not happy that they can t deal with it but hey ho they put me through. Man at clubcard says I have to talk to Tesco direct as they are money off and not clubcard vouchers.... I ll put you through he says then promptly cuts me off..... so now have missed out on £10 money off and you have missed out on getting my money....					2016-11-06T12:47:52+0000	1478436472	2016-11-06 13:47:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This morning I bought The Sunday Times and several other items.  When I got home I reralised the newspaper seemed very thin.  No wonder!  Half of it was missing.  There was no Money  Travel  Home or other sections.  I rang the store  and the very abrupt  snotty assistant manager said very tersely there were signs in the store to say there were sections of the paper missing.  Well  not on top of the pile of Times there wasn t!  She said they had been left in the rain by Menzies  were soaking wet  and they were waiting for more to come in.  Well  my knowledge of Menzies tells me that no way will they deliver replacements on a Sunday!  She said to pop back later and I could pick them up  but could give no indication as to when (as I said - pigs might fly if they arrive).  She couldn t get me off the phone quick enough  was downright rude  and I have made a formal complaint about her unacceptable attitude.  BUT surely in a situation like this incomplete newspapers should not be put on sale at the full price?  She told Customer Services when I complained to them it was the supplements that were missing  but she is lying.  The supplements were there  wrapped in polythene  it was half of the main paper that was missing.  This is blatantly dishonest to let customers buy half a product at the full price when you know the paper is massively incomplete.  What is Tesco s policy on this sort of thing?  Fleece the customer?  I am still seething at the member of staff s attitude  and even more disgusted that she called herself Assistant Manager.					2016-11-06T10:23:23+0000	1478427803	2016-11-06 11:23:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I collected my order from your Tesco store Gunton  Lowestoft.  Four items from my order were missing.  I have phoned your helpline to be advised I will be refunded which to be honest I don t want.  This is not the first time this has happened and I have actually lost count of the times I have had things missing.  I now have to find time to back and get the missing items which is costing me time and petrol money as I live 3 miles away.  Why can t Tesco just put the missing items in one of their delivery trucks and get the driver to drop it off?  It s their incompetence and they should put it right.  I have two young children which don t particularly want to be dragged around a busy supermarket on a weekend which is why I done click and collect in the first place.  I am feeling very disheartened that this keeps happening and am wondering why I use Tesco when they can t get an order right.  I know people make mistakes however as I mentioned before this is not the first time.  I just feel that by offering a refund you are not solving the problem but you are simply giving your customer inconvenience.  I spend a lot of money each week and that counts for nothing it seems.					2016-11-06T09:29:57+0000	1478424597	2016-11-06 10:29:57	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

No worries though there s a tesco 2 mins drive from the hotel 😀 so off we go last night to grab a bottle of Tesco Infant Paracetamol. You ve got it in stock great not so great it doesn t come with a syringe only a spoon! Have you ever tried to get medicine in a baby from a spoon  it s impossible and very messy! I mentioned to the pharmacy assistant there was no syringe she said yes you need to buy one! Come on Tesco you are better than that I m sure! Please consider putting a syringe in the box already instead of a spoon or offering them to parents to make our lives a little easier when our little ones are poorly because as you say  every little helps  !					2016-11-06T08:40:06+0000	1478421606	2016-11-06 09:40:06	2	7	2	0	9	7	4	3	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The newer packs are clearly 6mm shorter in length  and thus at least one biscuit fewer.  Neither EAN  given pack weight  nor price has been adjusted to take this adjustment into account.      A quick calculation (Based on the count of 12 packs in an SRP box) shows that this gives Tesco just under one extra packet out of every two such boxes  or roughly one extra SRP box per pallet.  This also scales up negatively for the customer  who will inevitably wind up having to purchase an extra SRP box (At extra cost) to obtain the same quantity of product. As someone who consumes these at the rate of about two packets every three days  this extra volume in purchase will be encountered pretty darn sharpish. :-/      You didn t really expect customers not to notice this  did you? I hate to use a cliche  but this REALLY takes the biscuit! :-o :-p					2016-11-06T00:43:34+0000	1478393014	2016-11-06 01:43:34	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were looking at all the Christmas stuff when she pick up the chocolates shown below. As you know a 9 year old can read pretty well. I was asked the question with a puzzling looking face. Mom why do they say love Santa. I personally don t think these are appropriate to be on the shelves because they cause a lot of questions from young kids. I was actually quite surprised and a bit angry to see something like this right next to selection boxes. I riggled myself out of it somehow but was hard. Were all trying to keep our children children for as long as we can and believing in Santa is a big thing. They grow up to fast. This makes things harder for parents. Maybe tesco can look into this and it could be done in a more suttle way?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14947927_1246941965348972_2420773348062187337_n.jpg?oh=bc8c652d64edcc91134c68845bab2190&oe=591BD4FB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14947927_1246941965348972_2420773348062187337_n.jpg?oh=7a59a30c706f7bd2c088f9b0ea3f5cb4&oe=592284EE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1246941965348972&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-05T19:43:05+0000	1478374985	2016-11-05 20:43:05	2	15	2	0	17	15	9	6	42	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco Direct does not accept Visa Electron online as Tesco Direct sells age restricted products. As Visa Electron cards can be issued to people under 18 years old; Tesco Direct can not accept Visa Electron as a form of payment.  But all other supermarkets do online  I used Tesco for years but changed banks and have that card so can no longer use it online. I buy alcohol from Asda online sometimes in my shop so why not Tesco??					2016-11-05T18:48:33+0000	1478371713	2016-11-05 19:48:33	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter had fallen asleep in my arms so I was struggling to carry her and the items I needed to purchase (I normally wouldn t have bothered but I needed to spend the £5 to cover parking) multiple member of staff ignored me until I asked one lady to help me as I was about to drop the sausages I had picked up. Then after queuing for 10minutes the lady behind the till did not offer to help me with my packing  now I understand I only had 3 items but she just watched me struggle!! Even more frustrated when I could clearly see the sticker on the till behind that say  say hello  get to know your customer  offer help . Such a shame as we always receive great service from our little Tesco yet a big extra store couldn t be bother to help at all!					2016-11-05T17:57:05+0000	1478368625	2016-11-05 18:57:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a boy and a girl.  Why are you charging  €10 more for the yellow set than the pink set??? I asked at the electrical desk about it and was told that s the way it is on the system so there was nothing they could do about it.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14947493_10210368086548432_4321334441927806343_n.jpg?oh=1a4a9e582a2de4b16e2cd7b0d4f3aacc&oe=58E1FEB7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14947493_10210368086548432_4321334441927806343_n.jpg?oh=9ecc9e3bdcb8adf9ba6b71f4cda3d632&oe=58E174BA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210368086548432&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-05T17:12:38+0000	1478365958	2016-11-05 18:12:38	3	8	3	3	14	8	3	5	6	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered a PSVR this afternoon via preorder  passed up the chance to physically buy one as I d already paid for the one through Tesco Direct  only to be emailed to say my order had been cancelled  returned to shop to buy the one I had seen only for it to have already been sold. Contacted your customer services who were about as much use as a chocolate teapot. Waffled on about stock not updating in real time however how does this solve the problem that the only gift my son has asked for I now cannot provide??? Well done Tesco.					2016-11-05T17:11:17+0000	1478365877	2016-11-05 18:11:17	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am having terrible trouble trying to exchange a kettle that I bought with clubcard points. I have spoken to numerous people in store and on the telephone  been told wrong information and been put through to wrong departments. Now the issue has been passed to the clubcard support team. I really think you need to look at how you offer refunds/exchanges on products bought online with clubcard vouchers as the current method is a shambles.					2016-11-05T16:39:28+0000	1478363968	2016-11-05 17:39:28	1	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

With more coming in!  Not just that  if you want to stop for a cafe break to let this all blow over. You d be lucky! As the only thing they can do in there is microwave your pancakes to rubber or your eggs. Only good thing would be to make a coffee out of a machine by simply pressing a button. Safe choices.

We called in to Tesco for petrol thinking we could use contactless payment via our phone but this was not the case  nor could we get cashback from the store using our phone.  Despite 3 or 4 members of staff  suggesting different ways of trying to help us out of our predicament  it seemed like there was not solution so we left the store (grateful for their help  but worried as to how to get home).  We were nearly at our car when the lady working on the security desk (sorry we didn t get your name) came running across the car park with another solution which we tried & it worked :-)    That the staff were so helpful initially was lovely  but the fact that the security lady carried on thinking of a solution and took the time and trouble to leave the store and fetch us to try it (when it would have been very easy just to let us go and try to figure it out on our own) was  to me  above and beyond.  I really wish we d thought to ask for your name so that I could mention it here - I do hope this message & our thanks finds its way to you (and your manager).  Keep up the great work!

I approached the woman explaining about the product she continued walking away saying she doesn t deal with this and go to customer service I found this extremely rude. The customer service desk was extremely busy with at least 15 other customers as it is also the cigarette and lottery counter needless to say the problem was not sorted. The food choices are very limiting as it is and this is not the first time this has happened  very disappointing.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14915268_1170489633038649_5804219938527205436_n.jpg?oh=2bcce8cbb686456eec2fbe711a774c5f&oe=58D633E6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14915268_1170489633038649_5804219938527205436_n.jpg?oh=c415bbb59a5ff663ed60458d16f0621a&oe=58DB3EF3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1170489633038649&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-05T16:25:43+0000	1478363143	2016-11-05 17:25:43	2	18	2	1	21	18	6	12	7	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ordered a shop to be delivered between 2pm - 3pm we had planned this with a busy day  we got home at 1.30pm and waited for the shop to arrive. at 3.05pm we decided to ring customer service team to be told due to a driver phoning in sick we have had to call on another driver and it will now be between 3pm - 4pm we said this doesn t suit us today and we need to go out so we arranged for the time to be moved to tomorrow between 11am - 12pm. Just as we walked out the door the customer service team rang back and said the driver is on your road and you next drop. After agreeing this would be acceptable and we would wait. Another 25mins passed and still no shopping we decided at this point we would not wait any longer and rung back and said please move to tomorrow. We was told that we would be charged for today s shop and tomorrow and then have to wait 3 working days for a refund. (Why should we be out of pocket for your error) I work within customer service and all that was needed was a call/text saying we are sorry but we can t make the agreed time and agree another time. On the way out we drove around the road we lived to find no Tesco van. Very poor service.					2016-11-05T16:09:29+0000	1478362169	2016-11-05 17:09:29	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But yesterday I felt like I was an inconvenience to your staff. I had a query about my receipt so I went to the customer service desk. The customer service desk is right next to the tobacco counter. 2 people were serving on it after 15 mins of waiting and my 4 year old son was having a meltdown not once was I acknowledged. In the end my husband went over and grabbed a member of staff (checkout supervisor I think) who came over and got one of the staff who were serving to see me (one of the 2 that ignored me whilst on tobacco counter) . The young lad that saw me was in such a fluster  although he gave me a refund it seemed he wasn t really taking any notice of my complaint and just wanted to get it over and done with. After years of working in retail myself  I find this shocking customer service - especially as its a designated customer service desk. If my son wasn t in such a state I would ve taken this up with the store general manager. Could you please pass this on to him/her please. Many thanks.					2016-11-05T15:12:28+0000	1478358748	2016-11-05 16:12:28	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had only just walked into the store and my 8year old daughter was sick I shouted for help from a lady on the customer service desk who was absolutely amazing she completely stopped what she was doing and all her focus and attention was on my daughter who at this point was still being sick!! She made sure my daughter had privacy behind the customer service desk while she went and get my daughter a fresh set of clothing off the shop floor so I could change her!!  The customer service we received off this lady was absolutely amazing  she is a credit to you re store!!  I didn t get her name as I was in such a panic with my daughter... but thank you ever so much x					2016-11-05T15:10:39+0000	1478358639	2016-11-05 16:10:39	3	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	3	1	0	0	0	0	0

Today our daughter Sophie was there with some of her cadets collecting money for the Royal British Legion Poppy appeal. She has been at this store for the past 3 years with no problems but today they were told they couldn t stand indoors  they couldn t stand together and they were causing an obstruction. They have to stand together as Sophie is the responsible adult as the cadets are under the age of 16. The store manger didn t even have the decency to speak to them himself!!!! I respect the fact the some people do not agree with poppies but it is actually raising money for charity. The air ambulance were allowed to stand behind the tills but female poppy collectors were not. Sorry but today Tesco either make a donation or hang your head in shame 😈😈😈😈😈.

I wanted to buy a tassimo coffee machine  stood for 10 mins waiting on assistance. Decided to go for a coffee and try again.  Finally sought out assistance by going to checkouts. Told assistant what I was after   asked to wait while she checked stockroom.  Only to be told another 10 mins later that item was out of stock and there should have been a point of sale to indicate this. Proceed to do my shopping and went to pay for items  queues were horrendous with only 2 checkouts open  went through the dreaded self scam. Then proceed to the lottery counter   again only one operater who seemed to be doing 3 jobs  another 10 minute wait. Is this acceptable?					2016-11-05T13:44:55+0000	1478353495	2016-11-05 14:44:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a 32inch HDTV from your direct page and it said it would be delivered Friday 4th. On said Friday I received a text detailing that it had been dispatched and that I could expect it between 7am and 7pm the same day. At about 9am I receive another text saying that it wasn t even in the store yet. Which kinda confused me. Yet when I go back on my orders on the direct page of your site  it remains to say it has been dispatched. Please reply back as I m slightly concerned my order has been mixed up or something.

My son applied and got a message telling him he had been unsuccessful within a matter of a few seconds. Very disheartening for him. Clearly it s up to you who you employ but it wouldn t hurt to offer people a bit of encouragement and treat them with respect.					2016-11-05T12:54:56+0000	1478350496	2016-11-05 13:54:56	0	9	0	0	9	9	1	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She helped me calm down my 6 year old who was hit quite hard in the back by a trolley and then told off by the lady pushing it  for being in her way! Emily cheered him up and took him to choose a magazine to make him feel better. Thank you Emily x					2016-11-05T12:50:09+0000	1478350209	2016-11-05 13:50:09	3	14	7	0	21	14	6	8	2	0	3	2	1	0	1	0	0

Yesterday evening  I purchased a hand full of toffee apples from one of your stores. A store to which has a large notoriety about it  especially in this post  so much notoriety that we and the children call it the devils store.  After arriving home  we tucked in to the toffee apples and to my utter horror and disgust a big fat caterpillar crawled out of the toffee apple that I  yes I  was enjoying  grabbed hold of me and dragged me inside the toffee apple.  Now I wouldn t have minded if the caterpillar had asked me first  would you like to adventure inside my toffee apple home dear sir?  But no  the detestable little oik just yanked me in with not a care to be had.  Now as you may know apples are quite dense and hard inside unlike a peach (that James was a lucky tike) and I suffered some bruising  now that wasn t the worst of it sir  oh no!  After he viscously pulled me in he took me to where I figure must have been the controls to fly his toffee apple craft and I was amazed to find that he had been shopping at asda (go figure right?) So I confronted him about this and he answered with  well  I do like an asda apple crumble  the cheek!!!! Anyway he flew me round for a bit  then dropped me back off at home  anyway my point is  why was this allowed to happen and why weren t the toffee apples checked before being put out of the stock room?  I am not only outraged but rather puzzled. Can you explain yourselves to me please?  Cheers.					2016-11-05T12:27:51+0000	1478348871	2016-11-05 13:27:51	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

The products individually only amount to £2.05 in store 🤔 When I tried to raise this issue with your customer services in store I was told this happens a lot  and I would need to complete an online survey to complain. At no point in the survey is there anywhere for me to complain!! Hence this post.

I went tonight  no less than 50minutes ago  to get some alcohol with my friend and younger brother. Once I got to the self-service  I was OF COURSE  prepared with ID  as was my friend  since WE were the ones buying and drinking the alcohol. The girl on the self-service instantly asked for my brothers ID. I was confused and explained it was not for him  nor would I ever buy alcohol for my UNDERAGE  baby brother  that we were the ones paying and we were the ones who BOTH had ID. I could understand her asking if my brother had been touching the bottles  carrying them or saying clearly which one he wanted. He did not  he just came along to get some food which we would get after the alcohol. I told her  it was not a company rule - but something a colleague would decide  both my friend and I work for another supermarket and know that if we were to treat a customer in such fashion  action against us would have been taken swiftly and we would have been punished. She called a manager over and I explained to him the situation - HE UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY  he did not have any reason to believe that I was buying it for my underage brother so he checked our ID s and approved it. The girl who had previously refused me  went to her other two colleagues - all three of which stood  giving us filthy looks and outright staring to the point where I had to tell the female manager there that they were making me very uncomfortable and could she please ask them to stop. This kind of behaviour is disgusting  not only to cause trouble in asking for ID  but to then purposefully attempt to make a customer feel distressed and uncomfortable. Absolutely disgraceful. I WILL be telling friends and family of the encounter  as well as anyone else who speaks of Tesco in a good light and I will not be coming back to your store (neither will my family) for such actions.  Unneeded!  (Friday the 4th  between 10 and 10.35  Tesco off Ipswich Road.)					2016-11-04T22:58:43+0000	1478300323	2016-11-04 23:58:43	0	14	0	0	14	14	7	7	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was all ready for when she got home and we sat down to eat together ... but sadly Tesco have substituted  slowly cooked beef  for what seems to be two chunks of recycled raw tractor tyre.... took a steak knife to cut one chunk to see what it was like inside (not nice!) so didn t risk actually trying to eat one of the chunks.... so it s in the bin and no supper for me tonight :-( ..... recommend you avoid the finest brisket till Tesco sort out their quality.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14947807_10211451235739914_5244437344824045040_n.jpg?oh=0202b718c3406fc987204c6e425a650f&oe=58DC9212	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14947807_10211451235739914_5244437344824045040_n.jpg?oh=8e2cba8b1d028b933ca1c322197dfc94&oe=5920371F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211451235739914&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-04T22:44:50+0000	1478299490	2016-11-04 23:44:50	2	6	2	0	8	6	5	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had no intention of looking at the fish counter but it caught my 10 year old son s eye and George came over and showed my son the detail of each fish  the teeth  scales etc and even gave him gloves to hold each fish. The end result was my son having the enthusiasm to choose his own fish to bring home to eat.  George even wanted my son to let him know if he likes it. I know it was quiet but the time he put aside for my son was really appreciated and to see him excited about fish was great. Getting kids to eat anything healthy nowadays is so hard so thank you George!  Please pass on my comments and maybe reward him for great service as this should be encouraged. 🐡 👏					2016-11-04T21:45:21+0000	1478295921	2016-11-04 22:45:21	108	24	112	16	152	24	21	3	35	0	107	4	0	0	0	0	0

I fly to America on a business trip on Sunday morning and ordered some items online  to collect at your Church Langley store- specifically chosen so I could collect after work. Online  as illustrated in the photo  it says your click and collect is open until 10pm. However upon arrival at 815pm I was told by your staff that it actually closes at 8. Apparently  this happens all the time  they have  consistently asked for the website to be changed but it never is  and  people always complain  Perhaps you can enlighten me as to why it is acceptable for this to happen  and what you plan to do about the fact that I have had a wasted journey  and am now going to have to return on your busiest day to collect a parcel due to an error on your part. I look forward to your comments.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14980632_10154613213665011_3689344547592598491_n.jpg?oh=7f97000accc1c12d6fe9f026918ea19e&oe=5921ADF9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14980632_10154613213665011_3689344547592598491_n.jpg?oh=ac955bdfb5d43c6f1cd58168ae549330&oe=58D89AF4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154613213665011&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-04T21:38:45+0000	1478295525	2016-11-04 22:38:45	1	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0

I have also previously been informed that I cannot buy makeup after 8.00 (they put down and lock the shutters)  cannot try on clothes after 8.00 and cannot collect items I have bought from Tesco Direct (a site set up for the sake of convenience) after 8.00.  Since the store is open until 10  I don t understand why so many of the services offered stop existing 2 hours before the store closes  especially since (apart from the Tesco Direct opening hours which are clearly stated on the website) I can t find any mention of these services not being available for the entire opening times of the store.					2016-11-04T21:32:55+0000	1478295175	2016-11-04 22:32:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Looked forward to try the new one with caramel inside etc. We bought two  one for me and one for my girlfriend. I took a bite  it wasn t Caramel inside the ones we picked up it was peanut butter  I don t like peanut butter  luckily I wasn t allergic to peanuts  someone who is allergic however could end up in hospital. I must add that the promo donut was placed next to the reeces ones on display. Please note the different drizzle designs on the donut  this was the one I picked up and therefore expected it to be caramel. I don t normally complain but this could be fatal!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14925526_1252136084848116_8095393745056674856_n.jpg?oh=efe7da75e2dc3cb7519bc9ee249f652a&oe=58D77D33	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/14925526_1252136084848116_8095393745056674856_n.jpg?oh=4ab8cb0a62dfedb9b4da4ac50fbfc99f&oe=58ECFF43	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1252136084848116&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-04T16:10:55+0000	1478275855	2016-11-04 17:10:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have 5 children 4 of which are young and also 3 are Autistic so shopping is never a pleasure. However a member of staff also disabled uses a stick called Karen Jones has always said hello offered to pass stuff down to use helped us find things when the move the store round etc and always smiling. We often pass time of day with her and she came up to us and presented me with a beautiful bunch of flowers and said these are for you. You and your hubby have so much to deal with health wise and coping with the childrens needs that I felt this would brighten up your day. Yep you guessed it water works burst the banks and I was so overwhelmed at her thought that tears of joy slipped down my cheeks. This lady is such an inspiration to us all that being disabled doesnt mean you can t work or be happy. So we feel Karen Jones needs recognison for her work.					2016-11-04T15:03:10+0000	1478271790	2016-11-04 16:03:10	5	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Order 1 basket of shopping to be delivered on a flexible slot. To find when delivered that something wasn t available that I have a £4 service charge. When I called to discuss I was advised that that was the delivery charge. When I booked my flexible slot it was £2. If I hadn t spent over their threshold I would have been charged a further £4 for that too. That s  £8 for 1 basket of shopping!! £8!!!! The attitude of the person on the phone has just added fuel to the fire and really annoyed me. I can shop on a different online delivery service and get a full months worth of shopping and be charged £1!! When I pointed this out I was patronised and made to feel like I was worthless. Not a valued customer!!! I m livid!					2016-11-04T14:54:54+0000	1478271294	2016-11-04 15:54:54	0	2	0	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I stopped shopping with you a few months ago. But with the stand you took against unilever and with the promise of your  brand guarantee   I decided to give you another go. Imagine my disgust when I was charged 1.89 and 2.00 for 2 items that I could have bought from asda for 1.50 each. When I queried this in store   it was explained to me that you actually compare ALL branded items and even it out. So overall my basket of shopping was 2.20 cheaper than other supermarkets  but you don t tell me which products are cheaper and I m still charged the higher amount for 2 of the products I know for a fact are cheaper elsewhere. Our basket of shopping came to a grand total of £155.77. It s not pocket change  that s a lot of money. So a measly 0.89 pence has cost you 2 customers who used to spend in excess of £600 per month on groceries and another £160 per month in petrol. I have to travel further but the savings on my shopping bill make it worth while.					2016-11-04T14:39:56+0000	1478270396	2016-11-04 15:39:56	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She went and looked at it and told me it s there because it s discontinued and I replied stating that it can t be placed there as it is illegal as it s drawing attention to it and she shrugged and walked away. Would you please contact the manager and request it to be removed from this location please.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14908204_10154043360933806_7718428041188981227_n.jpg?oh=0eff52a22230aff19e97ca0b64dba3ea&oe=58E1A039	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14908204_10154043360933806_7718428041188981227_n.jpg?oh=4294fb12f5a03d1d9d9b551cb80b7c3f&oe=58EEF134	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154043360933806&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-04T14:38:10+0000	1478270290	2016-11-04 15:38:10	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

She then proceeded to give him a chocolate santa. When he was younger shopping in that large store was really hard as he didnt have the understanding he has learnt now  it still can be quite difficult with him out in public but moments like this make our hearts happy (and his tummy!!!)

The zip broke and wouldn t undo leaving me climbing out of my coat in an important meeting. Highly embarrassing. I rang customer service for the lady to say  take it back to the shop and fill in a form. No apology  didn t want to take any details  didn t want to look into whether this has been reported by anyone else as a fault  or even if she could order me another one into store. Nothing  completely not interested. So I will take the coat back and get my money back and go elsewhere.					2016-11-04T12:26:57+0000	1478262417	2016-11-04 13:26:57	0	2	0	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In our eastbourne store a few weeks back you had a toy called baby wheels car transporter. It was £5 and I didn t have room to carry it home so thought I would get it next time as there were as few on the shelf. Anyway as typical there weren t any left next time I went so I called up when I got home and my local stores didn t have any. I was wondering if you would be able to source one in a store I am happy to pay postage? It would be perfect for my lil boy. We got the fire station but I really wanted to get him that as it has soft squishy cars and he is 14 months and likes to throw things lol hope you can help!					2016-11-04T12:07:14+0000	1478261234	2016-11-04 13:07:14	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was only released yesterday  does no one think more would be sold in Shrewsbury due to the local connection.

That was a couple of weeks ago. I searched but could not find it. So on 3 different visits I enlisted the aid of Tesco employees  including Customer Services  all of whom did not know what I was talking about and looked at me like I was deluded till I showed them the advertisement. And none of them could find it anywhere. Not even on your computer stock system. Are you advertising phantom products? I want sweet potato hummus!!! 😕	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14963410_627103064127373_7196335159284945299_n.jpg?oh=b555fc0b1c86625ff175ec46f642d708&oe=58D6C157	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14963410_627103064127373_7196335159284945299_n.jpg?oh=34f1cfec3c0177b2a8a9700919270379&oe=591E85A8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=627103064127373&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-04T11:31:24+0000	1478259084	2016-11-04 12:31:24	0	6	0	0	6	5	1	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Although I notice that there are 200 and something coats/jackets for boys but only 30 something for girls? But my question is this. Are you brave enough to stand up to the trend of only thinking that Boys like star wars and super heroes. Or are you going to believe that girls can like them too. One wonder woman cropped top for Winter does not convince me! Even Asda have got with it a little and produced some very nice  pjs.  I am so tired of my 5yo daughter having to wear boys super hero items that look like boys clothes. After all  you can get plenty for Women! Its very sexist to still believe that girls should like only girly things. Black Widow is a girl. Supergirl is a girl. But even the males superheros are just as important and don t need to be glittered or changed to pink logo s. Just a nice girls fitted shirt  or pjs would be a start.Superheroes clothes that look like they are for girls! My girl needs to dress like she wants! She is a big superhero fan and I know she is not alone!! She doesn t want any more fancy dress dresses  she has supergirl outfit hanging up with her elsa dress. She wants Tee s...Hoodies  Pjs!! You need to start a revolution and show the clothing industry its 2016 and little girls can be nerds too!					2016-11-04T10:35:08+0000	1478255708	2016-11-04 11:35:08	1	4	1	0	5	2	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are staying in a holiday house for two of our best friends birthdays and we didn t want them to find the birthday things we d ordered in our online delivery. So Grant arranged with store to put all the party bits in a separate bag for life which meant I could whisk it away and hide it before my friends caught on. That was amazing enough but on top of that they sent us an extra package with some Finest goodies for their birthday breakfast!   They didn t realise anything and we got to surprise them this morning when they came down :) Thank you so much!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14937393_10154007205025814_8955407092668760958_n.jpg?oh=a732540175a6d7a2e4f29406b206802a&oe=58DF8A08	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14937393_10154007205025814_8955407092668760958_n.jpg?oh=218fe382f10edcf8baac9e7a14cf3304&oe=58DB007C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154007205025814&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-04T09:48:06+0000	1478252886	2016-11-04 10:48:06	30	3	30	0	33	2	2	0	1	0	30	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well  we ve been chatting  and we ve decided that it s really annoying. It s lovely  but it s annoying. It was bad enough that I walked into my local store in October to find a Christmas tree in the foyer.  Don t get me wrong  I m no scrooge - I love Christmas  but Santa tills are blummin  annoying.   If you really want to do it  then that is absolutely fine  but can we just keep it to the last few days before Christmas. Or maybe something a little more subtle this year. If not for me  but for the benefit of the poor self-service member of staff who will have to listen to it all day  every day.

Getting fed up of having to walk on the road (or in someone s garden) because delivery drivers unnecessarily park and obstruct the whole footpath.  When I disturbed the driver this morning from reading his newspaper  he apologised but said  it s a nice quiet road  so  if it is a nice quiet road then why park on the footpath?  If he was taking his break or is early for his drop off  there is a huge parking bay less than 30ft from where he parked.   Hasn t mattered that I spoke to him  10 mins later he is still parked there which has royally pee d me off and lead me to post on here!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14962526_10154768532479665_9108386550978669985_n.jpg?oh=1d530148339abaaaf22a9a64e0d280d6&oe=58DB231C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14962526_10154768532479665_9108386550978669985_n.jpg?oh=9a393f14ae5dbde0c9ac2b4832edd734&oe=591F3B11	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154768532479665&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-04T09:21:28+0000	1478251288	2016-11-04 10:21:28	4	4	6	4	14	3	1	2	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	2	0

Our Tesco delivery arrived yesterday evening and 1 of the 3 chickens had 5th Nov as an expiry date  whilst the others had 10th. This was too short a shelf life and I handed it back saying it was a shame as I was planning to cook all 3 of them at once on Sunday.   Charlie was the delivery chap and unprompted he offered to come back at the end of his delivery rounds and drop an additional chicken. We said that would be great if it was possible.   Low and behold there was a knock on the door at around 21:30 which was Charlie back with an additional chicken (and also a pack of pancetta as I hadn t wanted the substitute available).   Absolutely amazing  well done Charlie and well done Tesco!					2016-11-04T07:35:58+0000	1478244958	2016-11-04 08:35:58	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now we ve never had any problems before but one of your staff members was rude and extremely unhelpful to us. My 3 year old son loves Disney s Lion Guard  so whenever we visit and he s been good  we treat him to the little figures that you sell. He was particularly good on Tuesday so we were treating him to 2. He was excited to find that it was the new range of figures and couldn t wait to open them when we got home. We went through self checkout as usual and the figures wouldn t scan. So we contacted a member of staff  who then proceeded to tell us that they weren t on the system. He then wandered off and came back a moment later and said we can t sell you them and then took them from us and walked away! Not trying to resolve the issue as your  Missions  say on your page. My little boy then thought it was his fault and got upset  we then had a tantrum on the way home. All of this because your staff member couldn t be bothered to help. I m more disappointed for him but the lack of interest annoyed me because usually the service is great.

So  can you tell me why your korma includes  tomato puré ?   Thankfully we noticed before she ate anything  otherwise we d be in the hospital A&E right now.  - co op on the other hand had a korma without tomato that I purchased  and I binned your version.

My parents have collected quality street tins since they were married 40 odd years ago up until they stopped having a different design every year.

Tonight shopping in one of your stores the fire alarm went off. After about 4/5 minutes of utter confusion the staff started to usher all us customers out the fire exit..... Then left us  stood by the fire exit. They all appeared to cross the carpark and go to what I m guessing was an assembly point?! But left all us customers stood by the fire exit doors. Is this right? It didn t feel right at all. Luckily it was a false alarm and we were allowed back in relatively quickly but it definitely felt like we would have all been in danger stood there right next to the building if it was actually a real fire. Not that the staff seemed bothered.					2016-11-03T21:02:33+0000	1478206953	2016-11-03 22:02:33	1	7	2	0	9	7	1	6	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

It loaded for what seemed like an eternity and finally told me they were now out of stock :(  I wouldn t normally be annoyed but within 30mins there were more on eBay starting at ridiculous prices. I know this isn t ur fault and I m disappointed that people are using the opportunity to buy up a child s toy to make a profit and worse people are encouraging them by buying them at the inflated price :(   Can you tell me if and when you will be having more stock?

Sadly the overpowering saltiness of the  seasoned steak  made it taste of nothing but salt! Very disappointed and not great in an age where we should be cutting salt intake! Surely we can make meals tasty without the excess salt? Luckily our whole meal wasn t totally ruined as we had the pear and pecan tart which was delish!					2016-11-03T20:19:22+0000	1478204362	2016-11-03 21:19:22	0	5	0	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to edinburgh hermiston store tonight.  Lots of the products dates were very short so put me off buying. However my main gripe is the bad mannered and lazy till assistant.  I placed all my shop onto the belt.  No offer to help pack or did I want bags. Because he was too busy chatting to a colleague.  When I was ready I realised I had bought too many pizzas with same topping and asked if it could be changed. Well the look he gave me. He proceeded to press the button to let someone know and then went back to chatting!   I askedhim if he was ready and then had to ask for bags. I was absolutely furious at this time about the lack of service   My shopping was practically thrown down the belt!  To add insult when I left the till he said to me sarcastically to have a good evening!   Poor customer service!

Every day for the last few months shortly after 6pm the Manager at the store blocks off the rear entrance/exit with a large bin that is normally sited outside the building. He does this so that he can start stacking the store trolleys inside the porch just immediately outside the door.  This is particularly annoying  because as a shopper I now have to take a bit of a circuitous route to get in the store through a till that is actually open (either that or open the closed till security gates and set off the alarm as the till at the end of the store where he blocks the entrance are almost always closed).  I’d be very surprised if it doesn’t also break a few Health & Safety regulations  which is why I’ve also reported this matter to Broxbourne Council.  I thought part of the reason for having a store manager is to ensure a good service is provided to the customer.					2016-11-03T19:21:11+0000	1478200871	2016-11-03 20:21:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went back to newtown store and it had gone! I was devastated to say the least and have been looking for it ever since and think it would be a perfect addition to our new house for Christmas.

I have spent the same amount in this period as usual  but have received about half the worth in money off vouchers. Also  I would prefer money off coupons for products that Tesco knows that I frequently buy  rather than coupons for Clubcard points  which don t appear to be worth as much as they were. It also feels like points are calculated less frequently than they used to be! Also vouchers arriving closer to the Christmas shop would be appreciated! I m a loyal customer up till now  but you need to offer me more to retain my custom.					2016-11-03T16:50:28+0000	1478191828	2016-11-03 17:50:28	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Disgraceful. I have tried locating them on their website so that I could review them  but cannot find them. I paid full price in October for these and cannot believe they are falling to bits after two washes. The Marvel one has just started dropping bits from the middle and the picture on the Secret Life of Pets one is completely coming off. I cannot find the receipt for them because I had thought they would be fine  never had a problem from Tesco clothing in the past  but will NOT be buying from there if this is the state of what they are selling. I was only able to post one picture  but they look awful. My son is so upset because he cannot wear them now and I am not buying them again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14956019_10209602911504094_6197565766992217357_n.jpg?oh=f1852d84eeadbad4180add7b0ceba3a8&oe=58E08C86	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14956019_10209602911504094_6197565766992217357_n.jpg?oh=34b1099229972fe229bf606767454283&oe=59248CF2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209602911504094&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-03T16:40:32+0000	1478191232	2016-11-03 17:40:32	1	11	1	0	12	9	2	7	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My eldest boy came out of school  with a piece of Velcro in his hand  it was the top strap of his Tesco school shoes bought for him only 8 weeks ago. Now  I know my boy wears his shoes hard  they don t last on him  that s why I buy cheap ones!  We head over to the BR store straight from school  thinking  I can get a new pair for him to wear tomorrow  so that he doesn t break uniform rules.  Head into the store and there is ONE pair of shoe which is suitable for a school shoe. In sizes 8/9/2. No other sizes available says the customer assistant I spoke to.  There were two pairs of black trainers with decoration  which I and many other don t Class as school shoes. They would be against the uniform rules of the school and are not good for growing feet to be in all day.  So now  due to no choice or fault of his own  he has to go to school tomorrow in his casual trainers and break the rules.   I am continually disgusted by the lack of choice of boys clothes and shoes available in Tesco Stores  but this really takes the mickey!

He wished me a good day and said he will be around for my Christmas shop and to look out for him as he will be in the carpark with a Christmas hat on. A very lovely man that made my trip a whole lot easier!					2016-11-03T15:03:02+0000	1478185382	2016-11-03 16:03:02	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered 4 different batons and also said yes to substitutions and I just don t believe that none of these were available and there was no crusty bread or rolls of any kind as substitutes.  We just wanted something to go with soup  so almost anything would do and I bet if I went to the Bursledon store right now  there d be loads of products to choose from.  Today s delivery was a complete waste of time  as I now have to go out to another supermarket to get what we need.					2016-11-03T14:14:57+0000	1478182497	2016-11-03 15:14:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had purchased an item of clothing from a branch about 5 miles or more from where i live as i happened ti be in that area and the item ended io being faulty. Ny local branch would not deal with it told me i have to return it from where i bought it from. I rang customer services who first told me i can bring it to local store and then said can i hold to  re check policy and then said no with an excuse of different stores sell different cloths? Believe me not the case here. I had to waste my time and cost of petrol to travel to store where purchased to the amazement of the love it assistant that they never heard such a policy. So Tesco where in writing is this policy ? Not on receipt that s for sure. So what if I was in Donegal and had purchased it with myself living in Dublin?  Never will I buy anything in any of your stores unless it is close by					2016-11-03T14:10:23+0000	1478182223	2016-11-03 15:10:23	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I proceeded to the ready meals aisle where there is a 5ft tall poster advertising this promotion and chose my main  side  dessert and drink from the Finest products on the shelves.  However  when I went through the checkout the promotion was not applied so I went to customer services to query it.  The member of staff at Customer Services duly went off to take a look at the shelves and returned to tell me she d spoken to a manager and Tesco are no longer running the meal deal promotion.  So I queried why the poster is still up if the promotion is unavailable and was somewhat bemused (and irritated) to be told that it was okay to still have the poster up because the POS stand had been removed therefore making it clear that the promotion was over!  Erm  no  sorry  there s a life size poster next to the shelf displaying the Finest Ready Meal products  not to mention the small stickers next to the wine and beer on these shelves.  So customers are supposed to see the poster and ignore it then! Makes perfect sense!					2016-11-03T13:29:39+0000	1478179779	2016-11-03 14:29:39	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why is it they also deem it acceptable to not provide a table and chairs for the poppy sellers? Why is it they also think it is acceptable to allow an 86 year old man to stand for an entire day? Why is it they also think it is acceptable to allow an elderly lady to carry a heavy plastic chair from pillar to post throughout the store? The charity this store ignored is supporting the people who made it possible for you to become the conglomerate you are. Where is your respect? You should be ashamed. #PoppyPride					2016-11-03T09:55:50+0000	1478166950	2016-11-03 10:55:50	2	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

It appears However someone somewhere along the line has pocketed my money and I won t be getting this back. After speaking with a customer service advisor  there is no top ups showing for this year on my club card account and as I haven t kept my receipts from January there is nothing more that can be done. I can remember the conversation between myself and your cashier and her remarking how organised I was so soon after Christmas had just finished.

I chose a pot of tesco own brand instant oats porridge. I have bought these before from my local tesco store at a cost of 49p. Imagine my surprise when i was charged 83p !! How can tesco justify such a difference in their prices? I understand the tesco express are classed as convienience however 34p on a tiny pot of porridge... absolute disgrace  maybe ASDA is a better bet!					2016-11-03T08:22:06+0000	1478161326	2016-11-03 09:22:06	2	5	2	0	7	5	3	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Christmas is now approaching and I want to get my son the Amazon fire kids edition with blue case. I see you currently have a great offer on and I also have clubcard vouchers I would like to use towards the purchase. All sounds simple so far doesn t it?  Well I see you are out of stock on Tesco Direct so I promptly add a stock alert to the item (not that I am now convinced I will get one). I also thought to check my local stores for stock online. Pitsea shows low stock so I race over to find they only have pink fair enough. Whilst I was awaiting for a member of your customer service staff to tell me this I enquired with another colleague there that I could redeem my points off my clubcard. She said no instore they need to be printed. I don t receive vouchers as I only moved house a year ago which I thought after a few calls to clubcard I had amended apparently not. No worries though as they have a machine at pitsea you can print off your vouchers so I just input my old address. When they said they didn t have it I thought ok won t print vouchers now then as it was late and I had a ridiculous early start for work the next day. Checking stock again I saw your Southend store had stock and thinking ahead decided to call the store in advance to be advised yes 2 blue in stock. So once I returned home from my long day in London sorted tea  bath & homework for kids I raced down before electrical desk closed at 8. On arrival I asked customer services where there voucher printing machine was to be told they don t have 1. Anyway I thought worse case scenario I would ask customer services to hold the tablet whilst I raced to pitsea & back. Get a store map to see the inconvenience this would cause me. However I thought go see for myself the tablet. Guess what happens next  you don t have any stock at Southend even when I annoyed the guy on electrical to check again. Now fuming I head to customer services as apparently the guy on electrical couldn t check the stock on his computer as it didn t recognise like probably one of the top 10 kids tablets. Even with a ticket in his hand which with my previous experience working in a supermarket I can only assume it must have a ref no on it to identify stock(just guessing it would be a useful thing to have on it?) so I go to customer services to ask why I was told your store had stock. Well without a blink of her eye she said yes you probably spoke to Cardiff. Well why in hell would I be phoning a store in Essex  to speak to someone in Cardiff? She said yes they look on a computer to see stock levels. So I said so you must have the stock then  she said no the computer isn t always right. I d like to also add at this point no one had apologised to me for all the inconvenience this had caused me. That was the reason so basically tough is what I was told. I then enquired if she could look the item up to see when stock was likely to arrive. Guess what she couldn t do that. I returned home livid  tired and again stressing on where I could possibly get this tablet you have on offer.  Well Tesco I would like to know?

On both occasions the shopping hasn t turned up without any calls/emails from the store to tell us that our shopping won t be delivered and to top it all your customer line closes at 11pm so I can t even get through to you to find out if my shopping will arrive this evening. The first time this happened I was informed the store had  lost  my order. I can t wait to hear what has happened this time! Of course I will have to call you tomorrow and wait online wasting more of my time to get my money back. I cannot believe that this is how you operate.

Not only was he nearly in my boot the whole time behind me (while I was doing the speed limit may I add) with cars infront of me for the majority of the journey.  Not only that he/she then went on to get into the wrong lane at a roundabout to try and get ahead of me where he nearly wiped my car out! Me and my fiancé then  watched him pull further dangerous manoeuvres whilst in our sight. I have noted down the number plate and will forward this onto you if needed.					2016-11-02T21:49:37+0000	1478123377	2016-11-02 22:49:37	1	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

My youngest son has multiple food allergies   I can t eat what he can t eat as I m breastfeeding him.  I m sure you appreciate this presents many challenges.  Thankfully we ve found a lot of products that don t contain the allergens   and that taste nice.  Again   a challenge as I m sure you ll understand.  So I was very disappointed to discover that  at a time when some tesco stores are increasing their oatly range   ours has discontinued oatly cream.  As if this wasn t bad enough I now discover violife creamy has been discontinued.  If these products are not restocked by my local tesco (a massive 24 hour store)  then it is likely I will need to shop elsewhere for out full family shop.					2016-11-02T21:10:00+0000	1478121000	2016-11-02 22:10:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went into your Stevenage extra store at lunch time. Firstly I asked a member of staff where I could find a product  he just pointed and said somewhere down in aslie 8 or 9 great help. Then I went to the till was being served when a member of staff who I think was a supervisor came to the till stood in front of her and started to have a conversation about a collection. I politely said excuse me but I think she is trying to serving me. Oh sorry was the reply with a tone in her voice as she turned to walk away saying this she pulled a face rolling her eyes  not thinking I would see this. My reply for this  there is no need to pull a face either her reply to me on this  pulling a face I m not its the one i ve had all my life  Poor check out girl looked embassed as carried on serving and gave me the other womens name  which I shell not put on public media  but customer services of the store do have. But to be honnest they didn t really seem bothered by this either!  I have often found bad service in your stores before and only use them when I have no time to go elsewhere.   But this I found rude beyond belief. Is this the way you want to promote your company? I will say in any company if I receive good service I was in retail for many years and know what a hard job it is  but this servce can not go unmentioned to you! I feel I would rather drive to another store on my lunch than walk to yours in the future.					2016-11-02T20:50:33+0000	1478119833	2016-11-02 21:50:33	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got an unjustified parking notice from your New Square  West Bromwich store whilst on holiday in the area  filled in the online appeal which the company rejected  I did all I was supposed to  got your parking voucher  clubcard have a record of my store purchases (my friend paid the bill in cash)  I entered the voucher code in the machne  it said no payment due as I only stayed 79 minutes  so I left.  I called your store after I got the first letter from the parking company (Smart Parking)  they didnt want to know  tried calling your customer service today  following advice from a message on twitter from Aimee  they guy I spoke to had no idea what I was talking about tried to transfer me and it got messed up and I ended up with a choice of options that had no relevance to my problem so I had to give up as I had to go to work.  Very unhappy to have all this unjustified hassle when I did everything I was supposed to at the car park adn I am now jsut getting fobbed off.  I have been a long time customer of Tesco  but that might change after all this					2016-11-02T20:44:28+0000	1478119468	2016-11-02 21:44:28	1	18	1	0	19	18	3	15	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

What a true asset to the company and to herself. This evening she has just helped out an extremely stressed out person with a simple act of kindness. After already trying an asda & tesco for their instant photo service to find out that both were closed after what was already a long day at work  I tried your store in bellshill and once processing the order to find it only accepted card and I only had cash on me I was nearly in tears. When I approached the customer service desk they advised there wasn t a work around but Laura quickly stepped in to offer to use her own personal card. And not only that  she wouldn t even take the money and wanted it to go in the charity box instead.  This girl deserves some recognition for her quick thinking and selfless act. Thank you Laura you have made my day!					2016-11-02T20:17:35+0000	1478117855	2016-11-02 21:17:35	23	5	24	3	32	5	4	1	3	0	23	1	0	0	0	0	0

Went out for the afternoon and came home to a pack of mini pepperamis and a note from the lovely #Tesco  delivery driver......  not sure if someone on her delivery round didn t want them but she had the thoughtfulness and kindness to drive all the way back to ours and pop them in our postbox with a note 😍. Thank you to the lady from the southport delivery team whoever you are what a lovely thing to do!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14947617_10154077752445745_1874137272306559957_n.jpg?oh=caee2ec072c7fecb537463d66c3a85ea&oe=58E8A1AE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14947617_10154077752445745_1874137272306559957_n.jpg?oh=349f453348ccc310c9cf449ef3969783&oe=58E040A3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154077752445745&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-02T19:56:04+0000	1478116564	2016-11-02 20:56:04	43	2	43	1	46	1	1	0	6	0	42	0	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my girlfriend were planning to have a curry tonight  butter chicken  sharwoods  £1  nice deal that  and then roll into bed. Things were going well  chicken was frying  water boiling  oven heating and stomachs rumbling. I went to get the naans from the cupboard  as we all know a curry without a naan is a sad curry indeed  and what do I see? The posh naans we bought on our weekend just gone shop are 2 months out of date! Well the kitchen is now in absolute chaos as we route through the cupboards to find something new to do with the chicken!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14947812_324533231253419_3471759974336546967_n.jpg?oh=e2fb50cecdd63796c572b4763a76a82b&oe=58D880F2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14947812_324533231253419_3471759974336546967_n.jpg?oh=84eb874bf51a68399b1f179ee41175cb&oe=591E440D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=324533231253419&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-02T19:29:00+0000	1478114940	2016-11-02 20:29:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He tripped over banging his head on a sharp shelf with in the end resulted in him going to hospital as luck would have it the pharmacist saw everuthing. After a few phone calls all made by myself to yourselves. I d like to add you never once rang me with I m told you should have. I was advised to seek compensation. Your solicitor sent paperwork wich I filled im. I waited and waited for a response eventually I got a letter asking for extra time to investigate. I then got quite a patronising letter back saying we wouldn t be getting anything. They even put the cleaning log in to say the floor wasn t slippy. I found that very patronising. It took weeks for my sons head to heal and it can still be tender sometimes. I didn t post anything on social media because I wanted to give Tesco the benefit of the doubt but I m sorry I think your customers needs to know how callus you are. The main point I raised about the shelves hasn t been delt with they are still in the store and still have sharp edges. Just because my son is the only one to be hurt shouldn t mean they are ok. One accident should be more than enough.					2016-11-02T16:45:44+0000	1478105144	2016-11-02 17:45:44	0	5	1	2	8	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The trolleys were not secured and due to the door design of the road they rolled out. Two panels of the car are damaged with a huge dent by the handles of the trolleys that hit it. Tesco are not willing to cover the damage of this. The car was not parked so please do not say the car was left at her own risk as it was moving. Because of your negligence of not keeping the road ways clear and safe you are now evading all consequences. Why should a customer of yours have to forfeit their own money for either a garage to fix or to resolve through an insurance company where your store has been negligent.					2016-11-02T16:29:46+0000	1478104186	2016-11-02 17:29:46	1	9	1	0	10	9	1	8	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why don t just put on the Tesco website saying  we will deliver whenever we feel like it  or  pay more for delivery after expected date ? Or even  pick a date for no reason for just a sake of it . I have to say your customer service is pretty useless: giving me excuses of it not turning up  tell me to pick it from a store when I don t have a car to pick it up with and your employee promised that it would be delivered by the next day between 8:30-12pm - where is it? If it doesn t turn up later today/ tomorrow morning  I would like a full refund back please. Terrible organisation.

My 11 week old son had decided he had enough and started screaming the place down. A fellow customer offered and unloaded my trolley on to the checkout for me so I could tend to my son. The lovely young checkout girl with blue hair (sorry I didn t see her name badge) then offered and packed all my shopping for me. She said they re here to help and I have more important things to worry about. She even offered to help me take my shopping to my car. Which I politely refused. I was really taken a back by how friendly your staff were and it really helped make my weekly shop a happy experience rather than a bad stressed one!  Thank you very much 😊 especially to the lovely blue haired girl.					2016-11-02T12:37:16+0000	1478090236	2016-11-02 13:37:16	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I accept happily that certain items need to be substituted and are normally done so very well..But in the last 2 orders I have made I have purchased 6-10 bottles of Pepsi max. And on both occasions is has not been available but it s not even been substituted. I order online a. Because I want what I order...b  to save time and c. To save carrying to the till  car  house etc.  This is not acceptable! I m not even offered Pepsi  diet or zero as an alternative...just not available! So now I have to make an extra trip out to collect this.  And what Tesco store have you seen that has no Pepsi at all!! 😡					2016-11-02T05:55:04+0000	1478066104	2016-11-02 06:55:04	1	12	1	0	13	12	3	9	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having this store just 10 mins walk away is very convenient and I dont really want to start shopping elswhere. However  I am so dissapointed that a few of my regular lines have now stopped in my local store. I can understand that some lines may not do well but I get the impression that the ones I usually purchse sell very well. I just hope this is not some tactic to make me buy more expensive alternatives from you  because I wont   I have lived in Yorkshire too long. And no HP brown sauce? The proper stuff  not that BBQ squeezy bottle blasphemy. What s all that about?

Listen  the past five days I ve been trying to get my hands on some of your lovely caramelised onion hummus - it s literally a taste sensation.  I mean  do you make that stuff out of chickpeas or gold dust?!   However  after searching in three - count  em  THREE - different stores  as well as sending my girlfriend out and about to try and find some. No luck.   I used to literally buy four pots a week  and now I am on an inflicted fasting of my favourite hummus.  If I was a fairytale character  I d be Goldilocks and your hummus would be  just right . If I were a wrestler  I d be The Rock and asking the fans   do you smell what The Rock is cooking?  And they d respond with   something to go with your hummus!     If I was Charlie Bucket given the opportunity to run Willy Wonka s chocolate factory  I d say   No ta  I m holding out hope for Tesco s caramelised onion hummus factory .  You get the picture  I really like it.   Please tell me you haven t stopped production of this fine product! I don t care if somebody accidently dropped shards of glass in the mixing pot or some fella lost his thumb in the production line - I d rather have the hummus and take the risk.   Please let me know  so I can have my mind put at ease  and know that I will once again be enjoying my favourite hummus in the near future.   Many thanks   Stefan Armitage (Clubcard Holder)  PS. Please don t tell me to go and purchase ssome caramelised onion hummus elsewhere  because you ll start to sound like my girlfriend and Sainsburys just don t cut it!					2016-11-01T20:05:16+0000	1478030716	2016-11-01 21:05:16	1	3	3	0	6	3	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	2	0	0	0

He was so polite and a real gentleman.  I honestly don t think anything would have been too much trouble  he put a smile on my face  just because he was happy doing his job the best he could.  Well done Tesco  and thank you  the driver of 9W / 8996 in Thatcham  Berkshire at approx 7.45pm.  😀😀					2016-11-01T20:03:36+0000	1478030616	2016-11-01 21:03:36	6	4	7	1	12	4	2	2	4	0	6	1	0	0	0	0	0

Just visited the Billingham store and wanted to try on some clothing only to find the bell to open the changing room is still broken (been broke for weeks). I find four members of staff chatting at customer service and finally manage to get their attention to open the changing room. All was well I thought. I set about trying on the items when my own skirt slipped off the chair in the fitting room. To my annoyance when I picked it up I noticed it was covered in dust and glitter. The floor was filthy and now so was my skirt!  See the photos  the glitter is hard to see in the photo I admit  but trust me I left the changing room looking like I had been attacked by a broken dust buster and the glitter fairy. I quickly picked up the shopping I needed and went to check out only to be served by the most ignorant assistant ever  she never spoke  smiled  made eye contact  offered to help with the packing  or said please or thank you!  I would provide feedback in the normal way but I can t because the sales assistant ripped the bottom off the receipt. Not impressed Tesco.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14900527_10202342341956876_603164544852938259_n.jpg?oh=cee0e6352522225294585f74f7e91e7d&oe=58E9EAE2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14900527_10202342341956876_603164544852938259_n.jpg?oh=94466b9e47421dc144f25b767039b2f1&oe=58E15BF7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202342341956876&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-01T19:56:16+0000	1478030176	2016-11-01 20:56:16	5	11	5	0	16	10	1	9	6	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I can t do that  since you chose not to make a response. Never mind  I ll post this on my own timeline   alongside the original. At least  that way the people that mean anything to me will know how I feel about your organisation. I realise that you are busy dealing with all the pictures of Halloween masks and are only too happy to respond to people giving you a pat on the back. but I would hope that you could  at least acknowledge one of your customers  that has suffered an injury at the expense of one of your products. Yes  my post was done in a light hearted manner and was not threatening legal action in any way (perhaps I should have)  but that is no reason for it to be ignored. I estimate that between my wife and I  we spend between four and five thousand pounds per year in your stores. If you wish us to ship off to another supermarket  just say the word  there are no shortages these days. I wasn t after compensation  all I wanted was an acknowledgement and some empathy from your organisation to one of your loyal customers. If that is beyond you  I know what I need to do in the future.					2016-11-01T19:40:56+0000	1478029256	2016-11-01 20:40:56	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The lovely lady stocking the fridge shelves yesterday went and got the last couple of boxes that they had left in store (they go out of date on 5/11 so won t last long! I would really like you to reconsider stocking them as I love your free from range for other things for him that are safe for him to eat but as they are a major thing in  my son s diet I will have to do my weekly shop elsewhere :( I really don t want to as you are local to us and my son is used to coming in to store (he loves the fruit to keep him happy around the store) it is a tubey yogurt style like the frube yogurts his siblings have. I hope that you can re stock them in store? Thanks Stephanie					2016-11-01T19:37:45+0000	1478029065	2016-11-01 20:37:45	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is a treat for me that I look forward to. Sad I know! £2.50 on a soup is a lot of money when you compare the price of the average can of Heinz tinned soup. So I expect the best  especially as it is from your  Finest  range. When I picked up my soup during my weekly shop I thought you might have made a dodgy batch given that I noticed the consistency of the soup was very  very watery? I came home today popped it in the microwave  still worried about how runny it was  given that I can normally stand a spoon in it? And then I noticed those two dreaded words  New Recipe ! Which translates to  a perfectly good product that has been watered down to cut costs for Tesco and to boost profits too . How can you still charge £2.50 when you have watered down  what was a very delicious soup! 😞 I note that it doesn t say  New and Improved Recipe  which is good as it would be a lie!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14908225_10154462056575027_3296088725497847157_n.jpg?oh=b47fc636b264990f128f1ee55b031549&oe=591B45F8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14908225_10154462056575027_3296088725497847157_n.jpg?oh=a415aad8b19b3d048e285db2129d9726&oe=591D2FF5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154462056575027&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-01T19:12:15+0000	1478027535	2016-11-01 20:12:15	25	13	31	0	44	12	6	6	11	0	25	1	0	4	0	1	0

I was just wondering for a favour - the last 3 times ive gone to fill up my car at you re store in Trowbridge you ve whacked the price of fuel up by a penny. Like literally the morning of when i wanted to fill up. In the future is there any chance you could let us know in advance before you increase your prices please? Much appreciated.					2016-11-01T19:11:43+0000	1478027503	2016-11-01 20:11:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have always been a big fan but today your customer service has let you down so much that I want the world to know how appalled I am. My daughter (4 years old) had set her heart on a pair of your school shoes so I bought them for her to start the new term with. She was so happy! And so was I at £13.00 that was a big saving on school shoes :) they ticked all the boxes and most importantly were labelled scuff resistant. So after her first day of wearing them to school yesterday her heart was broken that they were  ruined  with a big scuff on them. I was not impressed but reassured her that we would get her another pair. I never for a moment doubted that there would be a problem. After speaking to Lauren at your customer service desk at Swansea she advised us she would need to speak to a manager as we did not have a receipt. Understandable but obvious the shoes had only been worn once and still looked brand new despite the scuff! Lauren s manager Paul then approached us to say they could not be replaced or damaged as it was not a fault with the shoe it was a scuff and these things happen. We agreed that yes you can expect shoes to scuff on a 4 year old however these were advertised as scuff resistant and had been worn once!!!! Paul was very condescending and would not listen to a word that me or my husband were saying refusing to exchange the shoes. I argued that Tesco pride themselves on school uniform lasting and false advertising and he reluctantly and rudely said go and exchange them then but they will still scuff! We picked a replacement pair and Paul had disappeared from sight. Lauren replaced the product for us and as she was doing so another of her colleagues Lisa leant over to us and said  I m not being funny but they will do exactly the same  again very rudely. If we had our receipt we would have had a full refund and never bought school shoes from you again. As it stands we exchanged our shoes but are not holding out hopes as to how long they will last. Absolutely shocking that you are advertising them as scuff resistant school shoes however they are obviously not fit for purpose. I will be very interested to see how many people comment with how their Tesco shoes for school have lasted their children. Your motto is every penny counts and it certainly does £13 for school shoes that lasted one day! Leaving us out of pocket and with the extra hassle of an upset 4 year old and a trip back to Tesco. With a history in customer service I am aware of exactly how a customer should be treated and can t believe just how appallingly we were treated by a manager at Tesco! Very disappointed Tesco I shall be shopping elsewhere from today onwards.					2016-11-01T18:15:33+0000	1478024133	2016-11-01 19:15:33	14	29	15	3	47	29	14	15	39	0	14	0	1	0	0	0	0

The compassion they showed both my Dad and my Mum was exceptional.  They all went above and beyond to ensure they were well looked after.  There were also some customers who stopped and offered support  one who my parents didn t know but was called Donna. If you happen to have taken her contact details  we would love to thank her.  The other two were apparently the honeymoon couple and baby Florence (I am assured they will understand that).  Thanks once again.					2016-11-01T16:14:35+0000	1478016875	2016-11-01 17:14:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I waited up until after midnight . I am hugely dissapointed in you guys and expected better from you. I usually have at least 2 home deliveries a week. Don t think I will use you guys again. 👎👎					2016-11-01T15:54:24+0000	1478015664	2016-11-01 16:54:24	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered my weekly shop as usual as its a bit of a hassle carrying it up the stairs but I hadn t planned on this sleeping duo happening at a very inconvenient time.  Anyways when the van pulled up  I explained the situation and he carried the baby up to the flat for me while I carried the toddler.  He even tried to chat with screaming toddler when I stupidly disturbed her but no luck there.  Thank you again mr delivery guy for being understanding and doing more than your duty. Truly appreciated. Sorry I didn t get your name.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14633071_10154559786327177_4827650544341573899_n.jpg?oh=7c09db5abb58551f86145a34ae4d9f70&oe=58E7CBC2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14633071_10154559786327177_4827650544341573899_n.jpg?oh=774faa2ad4c875e69e07d74c71e4bd7f&oe=59191C24	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154559786327177&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-11-01T15:44:26+0000	1478015066	2016-11-01 16:44:26	49	9	56	1	66	9	3	6	10	0	49	7	0	0	0	0	0

I had ordered 12 bottles of Gewurtztraminer to arrive last night with 25% off but missed my delivery (my fault). The offer ended last night and when I ordered the bottles they stated the reduction would only be on deliveries by 31 Oct. I phoned this morning to rearrange my delivery which was emailed at the correct new price. So I called them with a view to cancelling my order even though it was our own fault the dele hadn t been received but before I even got to that statement they offered to honour the previous price. The only thing was I had to enter the evoucher reduction off my bill. No great hardship as they hadn t taken the money yet. Tesco you were amazing and without having to ask.					2016-11-01T14:53:13+0000	1478011993	2016-11-01 15:53:13	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I set it up for him to play and quite disappointed really there is no stickers to put on the pen which says there are. Also it isnt what i thought it actually was. There are no questions on the activity sheets they are on the instructions paper.the pen just makes a noise and doesnt speak or ask questions so if my son wants to sit and do this by himself if for some reason i am busy he cant as he isnt able to read by himself... If i was to return to store can i get a refund or return for a exchange of something of the same value he hasnt actually played with it.					2016-11-01T14:20:02+0000	1478010002	2016-11-01 15:20:02	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I rang the club card hotline to be told you don t give points on gift cards now.  Well why not????? I am still spending in your store. I could understand if I was buying Tesco cards. I for one will not be spending my hard earned cash in your store on gift cards anymore. I will go elsewhere and give them my custom. An explanation of why you don t give points would be good.					2016-11-01T13:54:39+0000	1478008479	2016-11-01 14:54:39	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Sunday I tried to make an online order to by a tv. Catalogue Number: 714-6584  I needed to order it with a note to the courier to call me 15 mins before they will arrive so i can leave my office and go home to greet them. So I called up on Sunday to see if this was possible.  On the phone  the girl told me that:  1. If I order express next day delivery  in the morning I would receive an email from a courier giving me an hour’s window in which I could go home and sit and wait for the tv. She checked on the catalogue number that this would be ok for this product and if it would get delivered by the courier that gives this option. 2. She could set up an account for me then and there and take my payment over the phone.  So I did the above.  I did not receive any email to confirm my account  or the invoice  or the order. This got me worried so the following morning (Monday) I called you.  The man on the phone said it was strange  confirmed my email  and just told me to sit and wait for the email invoice to come. he told me he could not resend the confirmation or invoice (which I think is weird). This was not a helpful conversation.  Later that day I called again as nothing arrived.  In this conversation I was told.  1. I should never have been told that my tv will arrive on Monday  as that is not an option - but why? (although it was an option online) 2. My email address is wrong - you forgot to include the ’s’ on amandameadows363@gmail.com. which is absolutely silly as this was confirmed in the previous phone call  AND the first phone call- your customer service advisors are not being accurate enough. 3. No one has the ability to change it (why????) and I cannot wait online for their colleague to do it - they needed to log a ticket elsewhere (which has not been done as I still have had no email) 4. The girl I spoke to was leaving and would ask her colleague to call me within 7-9pm that evening  every 30 mins until I pick up   and everything will be rectified.  I received no call.  to my knowledge i bought and paid for a tv  (a huge purchase for me)   I have no idea where it is  it should have arrived  I have no email correspondence from you  and all i am doing is wasting my money and time calling you  no one can help me or even return my calls. Do you expect me to keep calling you?  Where is my tv  when is it coming and does Tesco even care about me or my order or want me as a future customer?  To my knowledge it’s it could be sitting on my doorstep waiting to be stolen.

I must confess I am not a Tesco shopper  but the kindness shown to me last night has changed that. I visited the Cleckheaton Tesco petrol pumps last night at around 8pmish after going to my usual filling station and seeing it was closed. I was trying to fill my car and realised it was a pay at pump filling point  I must confess I ve never used one before and the gent that was working with the lady came to help and show me how.  For one reason or another after 4 attempts the pump did not want to read my card. They advised me I can t pay cash as that side of it had been turned off. Then the lovely lady  offered to pay on her card amd fill my car while I ran across the car park to draw the cash out to give to her.  She was so helpful and I can t express my thanks enough. I only wish I caught her name. Please can you pass on my thanks and ensure that she is recognised at the store for her fantastic customer care.  Mrs Emma Harrison (Now a Tesco shopper)					2016-11-01T10:05:21+0000	1477994721	2016-11-01 11:05:21	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son was due to start half days in the 1st week of September  so we bought a pair of shoes cost £18.00 from Tesco in Prestatyn on North Wales  im absolute disguested with the bad quality of the trainers  he only wears them for approximately 3 hours a day for half a term 4-6 weeks. They are split on the top in two places  the heel has completely warn away on them  the material on the inside of the shoes has all come away. Im really dissapointed I expected them to last longer with him only wearing them for short amounts of time each day. I just really hope it doesnt rain becausr his feet will get soaked  I cant afford anymore shoes until I get paid.					2016-11-01T09:33:16+0000	1477992796	2016-11-01 10:33:16	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just can t get my head around this at all. What were you thinking?  ONE - WHY OH WHY did you not go with  GINGERDEADMEN ? It s such an obvious pun that it physically pains me to see you neglecting it.  Gingerbread Skeleton Tombstones  is so long and clunky. You ve really dropped the ball here  Tesco.  TWO - WHO HAS A SKELETON ON THEIR TOMBSTONE. Nobody does. You don t put your own skeleton on your tombstone. You put it in the ground UNDER your tombstone. You then put like your  epitaph or whatever ON the tombstone. This is really basic stuff guys  and you blew it. (Ok  MAYBE you might have an engraving of a skull on your  stone  but NEVER EVER ACTUAL HUMAN BONES. C mon).  Look  I know I m being pedantic  but OH MY GOD WHO IN YOUR MARKETING IS IN CHARGE OF THIS STUFF?  THREE - THAT SHAPE IS NOT A TOMBSTONE  IT IS A COFFIN. The long hexagon shape is not a shape that people use for their tombstones. It s a coffin and you know it. What kind of stunt are you trying to pull with these blatant lies?  Also  that is far too much packaging for just two gingerbread biscuits. You could fit loads in there.

I can not find your free from fresh selection in your Ricoh arena store.i can only find your dairy free selection of deserts cheese and youghurts etc but no free from pizzas pies breaded meat etc. Can you please tell me if you actually have a fresh free from section. If not why not? It is very odd marks and spencer does a couple of doors away.also your freezer section is pretty limited and generally just processed food.  Also why don t you have your own brand of lactose free milk or youghurts yet you have your own brand in the alternatives like soya and almonds and there are loads of choice anyway. in fed up of going to the shop for milk and your out of stock of the lactose free milk.i can not have the almternatives-you tend to only put out one box of lactose free milk.im sure people do that same as me and buy 4 or 5 at the same time but these leaves the shelf empty for other customers. please help me on these issues.

I went to the large Tesco at lakeside to my disappointment there were hardly no toys except books  silly games  odd dolls & figures  nothing like what s advertised on tv. So I then went on line thinking I could place a large order as it was such a good offer on all toys apparently! Apparently not! I put 12 items in my trolly coming to over £300  when I went to checkout it said saving of £39! So I removed 9 items & left 3  it showed no discount. I then put 3 items in the basket marked 3 for 2! The discount applied  so clearly it s false advertising as the promotion is not on ALL toys & only on selected toys. I processed my order & recieved my confirmation email saying my order is being processed. I then recieved another email saying problem with my order  refund of £20.05 is being processed! No reason why. So the most expensive item can not be processed  that s convenient. I do not want this order as there is no promotion that in benefitting from. So not only is Tesco advertising falsely  but you don t benefit from any item you do buy as there s problems with the order! Tesco I m very disappointed & feel ripped off by yourselves. I want my order cancelled  I will take my custom elsewhere & spend my money where I am not being ripped off  especially leading up to the festive season.					2016-11-01T03:13:01+0000	1477969981	2016-11-01 04:13:01	0	8	0	0	8	8	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Asked if someone could cut one in half for me and they looked at me as if I were mad - told me no. Went to customer services to ask why you couldn t do what other supermarkets do and they looked at me blankly and said  Is that what produce said? . Honestly if you want to use a slogan like  every little helps  then do a very little and cut a cucumber in half. I knew there was a reason I can t be bothered to shop with you any more - Monday evening and half the fresh produce was empty - I won t make the mistake of bothering to use Tesco again - I ll just carry on to a supermarket that smiles and says  Half a cucumber - of course madam 					2016-11-01T00:02:57+0000	1477958577	2016-11-01 01:02:57	0	12	0	0	12	12	3	9	15	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
