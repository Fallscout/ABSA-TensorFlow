Had a text earlier with  sincere apologies  that my delivery would be late. Two hours late and still another 45 minutes until my new scheduled time. Forcing people to stay up late is crazy. We have a young baby and no doubt will be woken up by her early so waiting up for my shopping is ridiculous. Let s wait and see if my shopping actually arrives or even if I get anymore details from tesco. One text isn t sufficient to keeping the customer informed. Especially when no reason is given!!! No wonder I stopped using tesco before. Wish I d never come back					2016-03-31T20:58:22+0000	1459457902	2016-03-31 22:58:22	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your website stated up to 30minutes for both emails  one confirmation and one with the voucher to be delivered. We decided to wait until the morning of going to check on the weather  ordered at 8.15  conformation email came through at 8:18  waited (whilst checking) until 9:20 before calling. Got the car and children packed up ready  and would like to point out that myself and husband had taken the day off work. Then told on the phone that the website is incorrect and it can take up to 2 hours! The lady on the phone checked to see if this could be accelerated only to be told by the support team that there is a delay and that the vouchers can take up to 4 hours now due to system traffic. So I had everything  including the children packed in the car  and 2 options  ruin everybody s day by saying that were not going and waste a day off work or pay out over £100 for us all to go!  Thank you very much Tesco for false advertising  upsetting me on a rare day off  delaying our day and losing me money  as had I not have been using the clubcard points we would not go or mention this to our children as we cannot really afford to pay out over £100 on 1 day but now have no other choice!					2016-03-31T20:51:01+0000	1459457461	2016-03-31 22:51:01	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a Christian country why are we losing our Christian values? The Easter egg symbolises the stone from the tomb rolling away when Jesus rose from the dead. All faiths should be able to live together in harmony and respect each other s beliefs. I don t complain about other religious groups festivals and I don t think it s right that ours can t be tolerated.					2016-03-31T20:25:41+0000	1459455941	2016-03-31 22:25:41	1	10	1	0	11	9	7	2	15	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Both my husband and step-daughter are gluten free and the choice is always boring/limited and expensive! I went online and found that you had 10x more products available at a much more reasonable cost as it was your own brand. It cost £1 for delivery and the man that delivered was really  really helpful  friendly and knowledgable. Then you gave us a card and a choccy bar to say thanks for shopping with you.  I genuinely feel as a parent to a child that usually misses out she ll be thrilled to see some of the goodies we now have!

Some by 1/2 their weekly hours and by gosh it shows. The store is messy  toilets unclean and Tesco staff kicking the wrapping from shelf replenishing   would prefer they picked it up and disposed of it properly. If you need to save money try some other way  not on cleaning. I await your reply.					2016-03-31T19:43:18+0000	1459453398	2016-03-31 21:43:18	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to express my sheer shock of you bean melts pasties.  I thought I would have a snack of the pasties today to cure my urge of the yummy pastry snack  but to my suprise! I actually only had one bean in the entire casing of pastry to what looked like a miniscule amount of bean juice spread across the inside.  I have took photo evidence and thought I would attach to show you of my sheer dissapointment.  So here is my suggestion to improve you product!! Stop being so greedy and actually fill the things in which it is stated on the description on the Box and you wouldn t get comments like this on your page!!!

We had a delivery booked for between 12 & 1 today. We waited until 1.30 & then called to find out what was going on - no contact from you. We were told it would be up to 45 minutes late. This meant we went without lunch as that was coming in the delivery. We waited another hour & still no delivery.  At approx 2.40pm we had had a call saying that our delivery had been delayed & would not arrive until between 5.30 & 6.30pm. This was totally unacceptable as we eat dinner at 6.30 & it had fresh food to be cooked for tonight s meal  a fresh chicken salad requested (a family tradition) by our daughter for her birthday meal this evening. We have been told there is no way to prioritise our delivery & offered a maximum of £15 as compensation. This would not even cover the price of the meal we have to now go out & buy elsewhere  let alone compensate messing up our youngest daughter s birthday lunch & also risking her birthday dinner.  We have been loyal Tesco customers for several years but due to this we intend to go elsewhere in future & will be cancelling our delivery saver option & hope you will not make that difficult too. Signed an upset & stressed out mother.					2016-03-31T14:01:39+0000	1459432899	2016-03-31 16:01:39	0	29	2	2	33	29	19	10	19	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

They are absolutely rubbish! We have used pva glue (as the instructions don t specify what type) but at no point have the fuzzy sticks stuck to the felt. I have tried using the hair drier to help dry the glue before it is absorbed into the felt and fuzzy sticks but this is futile.   If you re going to make a craft kit  please make it so that the children can get something out of it. Children aren t interested in something that disintegrates as it dries!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/944993_10153488139808240_340587587862120818_n.jpg?oh=08aaecd89e47a1e51ddfc498d1875c0a&oe=58DC0300	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/944993_10153488139808240_340587587862120818_n.jpg?oh=7ea0398af48fed03b4af82fad8a70f40&oe=591182F7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153488139808240&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-31T13:47:44+0000	1459432064	2016-03-31 15:47:44	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I sincerely hope it s trolls because this is absolutely ridiculous.  Eggs are a representation of a religious festival. No religion should be left to feel ashamed or embarrassed to celebrate their faith whether it be Christian  Muslim  Jewish or Jedi. (I m not naming all the religions as there are too many not because I don t think they are all important to people who have that faith)   If you can t acknowledge the faith they are linked to then you shouldn t stock chocolate eggs at all as it is an insult.

I returned a broken DVD player i bought last week - still fully packaged - as it is not working. I didn t have the receipt so understood i could not have a refund. However  i was told i could not have a credit note but could exchange the £20 instore there and then for items of that price  but not for groceries. I was  allowed  to include a few items of groceries but no more than that - everything else had to be from the electrical dept. I asked what to do as i didn t want to spend £20 on electricals and was told to return another time when i did want to spend £20 but still could not have a credit note. I ended up buying a few items of groceries and 2 DVD s to use up the money - which i did not even want to buy. I was pressured into buying them there and then as i could not have a credit note - even though that s what customer services do for those without a receipt usually - and I was effectively  told  how to spend my money instore. I shop at Tesco and needed groceries  but was told i could not exchange for those!! Disgusting policy you have there!!!					2016-03-31T11:24:41+0000	1459423481	2016-03-31 13:24:41	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve even emailed head office about this.  My daughter is severely disabled and cannot sit unaided or without head support.  When I go shopping with her I have to put her in trolley with baby Base on it to fully support her. However that was OK up until she was 1 she s now nearly 4 and her legs dangle of the ends and get caught up on the handles. ... I get funny looks as if I m stupid and don t realise she s far too big or shouldn t be in it.  Why can t you get a few trolleys with support. This picture I ve added is of a girl at Tesco in Newcastle  that also has the same condition as my daughter.

They changed the fit which I thought was great at first until I noticed every time my boy had a wee there would be those absorbing crystals everywhere... I put it down to the first few so kept using but this has happened to each pack now... Fixed the design but ruined the absorbancy. I will switch to a different brand from now on.					2016-03-31T10:06:38+0000	1459418798	2016-03-31 12:06:38	2	17	2	0	19	13	9	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

What happened to your sensible priced delivery slots. I used to shop with Tesco all the time but the last 3 times i have looked to book an online delivery slot it has been 4 or 5 pounds unless i want it delivered late at night which due to a health condition i cannot. The last 2 shops i have done have been with another supermarket that delivered for £2 each time which maye not sound much of a difference but it adds up. Please don t take this as a complaint I am just bringing it to your attention. My husband is able to drive so can use Tesco frequently but health stops me from driving which means i rely upon a good value delivery service. I hope you all have a good day  and i hope you do not mind me bringing this to your attention.					2016-03-31T08:58:00+0000	1459414680	2016-03-31 10:58:00	2	9	2	0	11	9	4	5	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I understand the concept of marketing but you are trading on the goodwill and  IP  that hard working British Farmers  own  in launching these cynical names. It is a clear attempt to lure your customers into believing something that isn t true whilst hoping a high percentage will be taken in by it.

Thank you Tesco ❤️					2016-03-30T22:35:27+0000	1459377327	2016-03-31 00:35:27	1	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

Well when the audio on the TV I bought from you less than three weeks ago stopped working I certainly told my 9 people  but I will happily tell more than 9 people (well however many will see this actually) how very impressed I am with the customer service of your employees in dealing with the return on the tele. I rang the store to make sure it was correct to return to them they directed me to the electrical helpline  5 minutes later I had a returns code  an apology for the inconvenience and wished a Happy Easter.   When I arrived in store with me & my mum carrying the boxed TV one of the in store people came and took it off us and asked where we were going & then took us to the returns desk at the tech team. About 5 minutes later the refund was issued  no quibble and we were thanked for our custom and wished a good day.   When the sound stopped I dreaded a long & drawn out returns procedure  presumed I d be fobbed off to the manufacturer & messed round having to send it off to be assessed on whether it was fixable or just to replace/refund but my experience was very much the opposite.   Thanks  Tesco. You made the whole experience much more manageable  well done. Good customer service is rare these days 👍					2016-03-30T21:59:49+0000	1459375189	2016-03-30 23:59:49	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This made her day as her big sister works on checkouts in this store and she has always wanted to be just like her big sister  so thankyou Thomas  you really cheered our girl up. I would add the photo but there is no option to do so.					2016-03-30T21:31:19+0000	1459373479	2016-03-30 23:31:19	4	2	4	0	6	2	1	1	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited Tring Road Tesco yesterday and had to change my daughter s nappy. I went to the baby changing room and noticed that the sign indicated it was also a place to feed babies. Really?! Would you eat your lunch in the bathroom? No. So why think that it s OK for babies to be fed next to a bin full of dirty nappies. Please change your signs so that mothers don t feel they have to feed their children here. Feeding is not akin to changing a nappy  it is akin to having a nice cuppa and some cake at the coffee shop at the back of the shop.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12472457_10154145222603203_1093420823387251833_n.jpg?oh=30175766352b56fffa9ae3f2837f5f06&oe=592164C1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12472457_10154145222603203_1093420823387251833_n.jpg?oh=8491831ac36ed6bbd7c7d820569fadef&oe=591055CC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154145222603203&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-30T20:54:22+0000	1459371262	2016-03-30 22:54:22	29	9	30	0	39	9	3	6	4	0	29	1	0	0	0	0	0

Cooked and served to all my family. Two young kids both under 3  me and my husband. Left the package empty on the kitchen worktop and after dinner I realised was expired.  Raised a complaint and been answered that this is uncommon for them to have certain situations but can happen although they are trying to give to the staff the right training. Unbelievable. The only thing I can say is unbelievable. I ll go certainly further. The only things I m happy is that nothing happened to my children and us.					2016-03-30T20:46:10+0000	1459370770	2016-03-30 22:46:10	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I brought tesco prawn crackers for my two kids to go with their stir fry. When my daughter and son started to eat them tonight my daughter said they didn t taste right. So I tried one which they tasted  very stale. So I looked at the date they was 09 December 2015. I called the store no answer. So called head office which they offered me a £5 voucher. The more I think about it is not good enough nearly 5 months out of date is not acceptable. I have also been trying to ring the store since 6 o clock tonight no answer it s diverted to a mobile which rings and rings.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12472576_10154060281709105_2627146600704434464_n.jpg?oh=a569b05926bacc77b4c97e230621b9a0&oe=590EAB0C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12472576_10154060281709105_2627146600704434464_n.jpg?oh=4241c68d21a11c76f0f994d054cfde2a&oe=590A7E01	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154060281709105&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-30T19:19:52+0000	1459365592	2016-03-30 21:19:52	1	12	1	0	13	12	7	5	11	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

You re supposed to be encouraging customers to shop with you  unfortunatley you have now made me want to do the complete opposite.					2016-03-30T18:51:21+0000	1459363881	2016-03-30 20:51:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a packet last week and noticed the side straps were different. But since I have been using them they seem to irritate my little girl  she has had a sore bum and has a red irritated band around her back where the waist band is. It s really sore and bothering her to the extent I ve been out and bought another supermarket brand tonight as she can t sleep in them. Please let me know what you have done to them as Tesco nappies have always performed best in the past!					2016-03-30T18:46:32+0000	1459363592	2016-03-30 20:46:32	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The cost of crude oil has reduced by almost 3%. Gasoline has reduced by 1%. There was no increase in the latest government budget but you see fit to increase your prices by over 3%. Where is the reasoning of justification behind this???

I m fascinated to know  how a product which was  half price  last week and cost £5  is now  half price  again this week and costs over £11?   All your legs of lamb were labelled up at half price last week  selling for £5. In your Kingston Milton Keynes store today  you ve got more legs than Pan s People all labelled up as  half price  again yet now selling at various weight-specific prices  all above £10.   Really interested to hear your view on the compliance and the ethics of this wondrous back-to-back promotion.

Bought it when he was about 6 months old. He is now 18 months but it has started to literally come apart at the seams. Where the shoulder strap are have ripped and more worryingly the seat seams are coming undone spilling the insides out.   I down expect one of your products to last 12 months. Especially something that is meant to last at least a few years. Not impressed.					2016-03-30T16:36:02+0000	1459355762	2016-03-30 18:36:02	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am a  trans male and I was in galashiels tesco when I needed to use the toilet. It is hard to use the toilets as a trans man as I am afraid of being discriminated for using the men s.  I went to the customer service desk and explained my situation. The woman at the desk told me not to worry and I can use the men s.  While I was washing my hands I noticed a man come in and walk back out. When I came out I noticed the man was a security guard who pointed out it was the men s toilet. I explained why I used them and he said I should use the ladies. I told him I was told I was allowed and he told me to wait while he spoke to her. I got impatient and went to the desk where the lady said she thought I was taking my son into the ladies toilets.  She said she misunderstood me and was not listening properly when I said I am trans male and I want to know of the toilets are trans friendly. I did not mention a son  I don t even have a son. They advised I use the disabled toilets  I said I wasn t disabled and they pointed out it s also for people who do not have a visible disability.   I am not disabled and I am appalled that the lady at costumer services lied to the security guard about what she told me. I left the store humiliated as I was confronted in the middle of the doorway to the men s toilets in front of people wanting to use it and was asked by one what the problem was also the woman lying to protect herself. If you are not trans friendly then say so as it s hard enough I have to sneak in mens toilets to avoid confrontation and now I have been put in that situation out of coawrdness from one of your staff.  I am man therefore I should have access to the men s toilets without a problem.					2016-03-30T15:07:05+0000	1459350425	2016-03-30 17:07:05	0	3	0	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After many emails  phone calls FB posts where everyone is very apologetic as per their training at the end of every message they say  but there s nothing we can do  you should have read the small print. After a week or so of getting nowhere with Tesco i was referred to Clever boxes who were supposed to have had it collected today but as yet 3-15 pm no message from the courier who i was told would contact me at 10am. So  after staying up late last night transferring my files  packaging the laptop and staying in today the lady from Cleverboxes tells me  well they are probably busy and didn t guarantee picking it up today. THIS IS THE MOST APPALLING BUYING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD my views and inconvenience mean absolutely nothing to either Tesco or Cleverboxes  but i suppose i should have read the small print after all thats what it s therefore to enable companies to avoid any responsibility  again APPALLING.					2016-03-30T14:24:13+0000	1459347853	2016-03-30 16:24:13	0	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Not sure if this has been discussed as I have not visited your page before  but want to let you know that I think the new  Farms  branding is a dreadful idea! As the farms obviously do not exist  it seems like a very feeble attempt to make us think we are buying better  farm  produce. On the contrary  for me it just insults my intelligence. I have no problem with the produce  just the new labelling. I know you have had problems over the last few years  but to me this looks like you have just created another! I m surprised it got past the discussion stages and would be interested in learning the thinking behind it.

The range that doesn t contain dairy my Tesco in Hornchurch will no longer stock even though i asked very nicely for them to bring it back there are more meat eaters in my area so basically stuff me!!! The staff were told any item they no longer stock if the shoppers ask for it they will bring it back so why was i told NO nothing i asked for including cat food  Tesco veggie gravy etc.. they will not restock. I purchased the frozen veggie Linconshire style sausages the other day thought they were worth a try they tasted of nothing but sage i like sage but that is an overkill and what have you done to your veggie mince it is like rubber? The meat style burgers have no taste at all (do you employ tasters?) I am slowly losing my patience i have been a loyal shopper for over 37 years looks like loyalty is not repaid they are not interested at all with bringing back the items but i can travel to Southend on Sea and get everything i want as Southend isnt near i have no desire to go. Looks like i will have to change to Sainsburys i might actually get some of the items there instead unless someone from Tesco can explain to me why they wont help					2016-03-30T11:01:22+0000	1459335682	2016-03-30 13:01:22	0	38	0	0	38	38	8	30	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

If Tesco are that concerned about offending ppl.... Don t sell Easter eggs...... Christmas items..... Or any other products that celebrate any faith s religious views......  Oh... Hang on a minute.... They won t do that..... It will affect their profits.......  They like to make statements that will give them free publicity...... For a year until next Easter if they re lucky..... Typical profit making organisation.....					2016-03-30T10:29:24+0000	1459333764	2016-03-30 12:29:24	2	25	2	2	29	24	12	12	77	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a fridge freezer and a tumble dryer in the Tesco Extra store in pool over a week ago. They was both hotpoint. The girl there told me i would get an hour delivery slot ( I NEVER DID) also told me as my adress wouldnt show up to ring on the day of delivery and change the address as mine wouldnt show up( ALSO WASNT ALLOWED!!!!) So it was going to get delivered to my friends hour 10 minute walk away from my house waiting in ffof the timeslot that HOTPOINT had sent me for it not to turn up so i ring them and they tell me its 5 mintues away and a driver was going to ring me.. What a suprise NO PHONECALL!! so i rang them again to be told it was an hour away. Made a complaint and was told by hotpoint all tesco had to do was email them accross my correct adress so they could put it in manually!!!! Cancelled the order went to Tesco last night to get hardly any reaction to it and was told ut will be better if i waited until today to speak to a manager. Went there and after 20 minutes of waiting they finally found someone!!! JUST TO LET YOU KNOW TESCO THIS IS NOW 2 DAYS YOU HAVE RUINED AS I AM HAVING TO HUNT AROUND FOR A FRIDGE FREEZER! HAVING MY 4 YEAR PLD NEPHEW AND A 5 MONTH OLD BABY WITH NO FRIDGE!! IVE BEEN LUCKY TO GET ANY SORRY ALONG THE WAY IN THIS AND IVE HAD TO DO ALL THE CHASING! I KNOW IM JUST A NUMBER TO YOU BUT I WILL NEVER EVER SHOP IN YOUR SHOP AGAIN I THINK TESCO NEEDS TO SORT ITSELF OUT ABSOLOUTLY FURIOUS! DISGUSTING COMPANY!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠					2016-03-30T09:20:31+0000	1459329631	2016-03-30 11:20:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had problems getting into my account and phoned up and the girl stayed on the phone with me and helped me step by step to sort it 😊.  Then after making my order I discover I had 2 clubcard account numbers and needed a new card as I had lost mine - again the last on the other end of the phone was extremely helpful and polite and sorted everything out for me.

Firstly  not everyone likes to be physically touched by a total stranger  irrespective of the intent. Secondly  try looking up the concept of transmission -  you know  the idea of spreading infections through amongst other things skin contact!  My wife today witnessed a greeter at your walkden store touch the face of a child who quite obviously had a cold and then walk straight up to an old lady and do the same. Not saying get rid  just maybe teach them that not everyone likes it and it s maybe not the most hygienic of practices.					2016-03-29T23:09:52+0000	1459292992	2016-03-30 01:09:52	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

So i lifted it up to read up   to my surprise... Only got it yesterday i don t even check Tesco products i trust they are gonna be in date   that s why u have all the staff and computers to check stock.  Disappointed !  Purchased in Tesco Arklow   Low Low snack bites.  Always gonna check for dates from now on.

I was surprised when I d finished unloading the baskets and putting stuff away to see such a small item  so small I d missed it amongst all the other shopping. In fact  I d assumed it was one of the items that had been unavailable.   For comparison  it s pictured next to a can of Tesco s own ginger beer (330ml). Now I would not call this  medium  by any means  at most it is small. I imagine there isn t much I can do about this as I don t have a Tesco conveniently nearby (hence the home delivery) so cannot easily return the  item. It may only be 90p on my shop  but this will barely serve one person  let alone a household. Needless to say  I am unimpressed and wish to have my 90p back.   In the meantime I ll be visiting one of your competitors to purchase a significantly larger butternut squash to feed the household.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12932948_10205285246403458_1988862547099354178_n.jpg?oh=77a6026d10fe1a89ff925946a693aeb6&oe=58DB50DC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12932948_10205285246403458_1988862547099354178_n.jpg?oh=4e03d88b51286fa88dc1198e64df17d7&oe=591BAFD1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205285246403458&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-29T21:05:39+0000	1459285539	2016-03-29 23:05:39	9	2	9	0	11	2	2	0	1	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I unpacked the fruit there were several rotten items that were totally inedible.  I logged on and the advice was to return them to a local store. The whole point of the deilvery is I am way to bus to go to a store.  I live rurally.  In the age of great customer service this is not really acceptable.  The only time Ocado ever sent the wrong thing they simply refunded the cost. I will be returning to Ocado from now on unless I can be assured this is not the policy going forward					2016-03-29T19:42:57+0000	1459280577	2016-03-29 21:42:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We didn t need much and decided to use the hand held scanner. We went around and got what we needed and the scanner said it was £56.37. I went to the pay area  scanned the barcode and it downloaded our shopping to the till. Once it was downloaded the till said that it came to £78.37.  We went through the list and there was no way it was that amount. My husband asked one of the staff to check it for him and they looked at the till and marked off our shopping in the trolly and said that it was correct.  We disagreed but they said that they couldn t do anything and we should pay and go to the customer service desk. We grudgingly did this then went outside and added up everything in the receipt and it came to £56.37 but the total on the receipt was £78.37!   So back in to the store we went and spoke to a staff member who didn t know what had happened but noticed that the receipt wasn t complete with the logo at the top missing. So she got a calculator and added up the items that were on the receipt and surprise! It came to £56.37! So off she went to another staff member who went to the till and brought up the items I had scanned through.  Apparently someone before me didn t complete the purchase and the items stayed in the till even though we started from scratch.  Thankfully I got the amount refunded straight away (as well as my clubland points that were added to the previous shoppers account  you re welcome!) but how many times has this happened to other people that might not have noticed? If it had been a couple of pounds I would  not have noticed.  If you get a receipt like this one then please double check it.  We are contacting head office about this as it shouldn t happen and the fact that we had to pay and check it ourselves is simply bad practice by Tesco.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/s130x130/12442711_1080376998696488_742857762_n.jpg?oh=ee595f612c610751bd2e889456424c8e&oe=588126C7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/s720x720/12442711_1080376998696488_742857762_n.jpg?oh=06cf8f78a0e03138735a77b089d77bd6&oe=588145C9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1080386085362246&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-29T19:02:38+0000	1459278158	2016-03-29 21:02:38	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They didn t need to help but they still came out  called an ambulance and stayed with her until it arrived. She doesn t remember anything that happened (she has the beginning stages of dementia) but you were a shining star when we couldn t be there. Thank you so so much.

Visited today for a small top up of groceries  when I got there were signs everywhere promoting their 25% off if you purchased 6 or more bottles of wine. It seemed churlish not to take advantage. However when I checked out and paid the receipt showed no discount. I found a Tesco supervisor to ask why no discount was given  she explained that it was only on selected items. I pointed out that this wasn t indicated on their large promotion signs and took her to one. She then pointed to a minute asterisk. I asked the relevance and she said that meant only selected items. I asked  how was is supposed to know that and she pointed to another very small notice that explained the offer. I left the store and won t be going back to Tescos ever again.  Tescos you are a disgrace  blatant misrepresentation. No wonder people are deserting your stores in their millions. 😡😡😡😡					2016-03-29T16:11:10+0000	1459267870	2016-03-29 18:11:10	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was disappointed today to find a very hard piece of plastic  possibly it has come loose from the mechanism of the equipment that is used and almost had a tooth emergency! I am uninjured but releived this was not in my childrens dinner! I have used courgette spaghetti  butternut squash and carrot from the range in my recipe and possibly from the carrot. I purchased these today from the Airdrie store - I wouldn t like anyone else to possibly suffer an injury and wished to highlight this for your information and staff at the Airdrie store.

Just twenty minutes ago I brought one of your standard £4.50 car washes thinking it would do the job nicely as I usually get the value car wash but thought as that usually is sufficient I d upgrade to your next up well it hasn t  done the job at all I live in a sea side town so seagull droppings are common but it has bucketed it down with rain here in the last few days due to storm Katie so hardly like it was baked on  anyhow after using the car wash I d expected my car to be gleaming however there is bird droppings still visible on my car  the windscreen is marked and to top it off the paint work above my boot has been scratched up which I can tell you right now was not there before hand  I take pride in my car keeping it clean as who wants to be seen driving a filthy car!?! Not me that s for sure! I m more then happy to send you photo evidence of what I m telling you about and to say the least I m extremely disappointed as I go out of my way to your car wash when there are many more local to me! Next time I ll stick to old fashioned hand car wash only reason I didn t on this occasion is because I m due to have a baby in the next two weeks!! I want answers as this is not exceptable a shoddy job done  that has left my car worse off!!!					2016-03-29T13:59:15+0000	1459259955	2016-03-29 15:59:15	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Someone pulling out. Lady waiting to go in the space.....as I started to drive past I saw no child in seat so got her to wind window down and explained we had child in back. Her response  Well I ve got a car seat in the boot. Just because I haven t got a child with me today doesn t matter does it?  and she pulled in to the space. Someone else moved and I got a space and told her what I thought about it. Her justification  well that other car moved so there was another space! I m not the only one who does it!  Yes but what about the other parents who come after and there s no space! There are also lots of people without badges that park in disabled. And when I asked about it turns out none of it is monitored. People have to let customer services know. Other supermarkets have staff walking round car park and enforce with a fine.

They use an employment agency called Noonan.  The first experience I had with a member of this agency I already complained to Tesco about.  So today I was waiting for my mother to get money and a trolley and the  security guard  saw me and proceeded to follow my mother and I all around the store.  Every single time I turned around  he was there.  We went to the checkout  he was there.  My mother left and I was talking to the checkout girl and he followed my mother.  We use Tesco ALL the time  but I am refusing to shop there during any holidays especially when jobsworths are used to provide cover.  We were made to feel like a shoplifters the way he was behaving.  It was absolutely shocking.					2016-03-29T13:07:25+0000	1459256845	2016-03-29 15:07:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

People need to be aware of the small print when ordering from Tesco.   I placed an order this morning and my money was taken straight away.  I then received an email to say that my order had been confirmed. 10 minutes later  I received another email saying that there was a problem with my order and that it was being caneclled. No expalanation in the email at all. I rang Tesco to be told that my item was out of stock. I explained that I had paid and received a confirmation email. I was told that Tesco do not have a live ordering system and that there was no guarantee that I would get what I had paid for.  I said surely you can t be allowed to take money for goods that you know you can t supply and was told it is not illegal and it does state this in the terms and conditions small print. I now have to wait up to 5 working days for a refund. Be aware that if you need a product urgently  Tesco can keep your money for 5 days  even though it was never in stock in the first place.  I can t afford to buy another product until I get my refund in 5 days.					2016-03-29T12:40:30+0000	1459255230	2016-03-29 14:40:30	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is despite me receiving an email from them (I have a copy) in Nov 14 thanking me for sending it in & telling me I don t need to keep original - oh yes that is what they said! I am now without a Hudl whilst they deal with it with no timescale. As you sold the insurance & the Hudl to me some QUICK customer service your end would be great please.

Selected 2 packs of Cox s (6 in pack) costing £1 50 for each pack. Not only did I see the same amount of Gala apples in a pack for 75p saving 75p as well. Instead of abandoning them on another shelf I placed them with the others of the same kind. If I wasn t near the fruit department and decided not to buy them I would have given them to the cashier so a member of staff can place them back in their original position later.					2016-03-29T11:03:28+0000	1459249408	2016-03-29 13:03:28	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It stopped me from ordering my shopping last week  £5 may not seem like a lot but to a single parent who counts pennies it seems like a unjust charge when Iceland a comparatively smaller company offer free delivery when only spending £25 instore					2016-03-29T11:00:01+0000	1459249201	2016-03-29 13:00:01	2	26	2	0	28	26	25	1	18	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would just like that thank you for having the easiest and most user-friendly online shopping site.  I have been online since 9 am this morning trying to make an order of a special occassion dinner as a gift for a family member 100 miles away and i was getting quite fed up with having my order refused because it didn t meet the minimum £40 spend.  Thank you once again for being so user-friendly.  My order has just been confirmed and we are sure our son in law will be delighted with his birthday dinner.

Please can you explain what s happened to your nappies? I ve used your nappies for a number of years  however recently they appear to have changed and not for the better. My daughter has been in 5+ for a while but noe the nappies seek too big  as though there s too much elasticity in the tabs and at the back. Also I m finding the nappies aren t holding as much as they did and so it s full of crystals in the morning even if it s not that full. I don t want to switch brands but I m not happy with the changes that have been made.

Kingsmill 50/50 loaf use by 30th March. It s 10pm on March 28th for goodness sake.! If I buy one from a store it normally has a date about 5 days later. I couldn t give it back to he driver as I need it for in the morning but I ll have to buy another one on Wednesday now. There s no room in my freezer so looks like the birds round here will be well fed on Thursday . That s the last time I ll be including fresh goods in my online shop from Tesco. I never have this problem with Sainsburys!					2016-03-28T21:20:37+0000	1459200037	2016-03-28 23:20:37	1	27	1	0	28	27	10	17	24	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can I ask why do you keep changing products thinking you have improved them? Everytime we find something like a cake that we love  you either stop selling it or change it. The round Angel cake you sold was amazing and you stopped selling it  your pink iced ring doughnuts were loved by my son but now you have changed them and he doesnt like them anymore. Why do you decide to change things? Do you ask your shoppers what they think?					2016-03-28T20:54:49+0000	1459198489	2016-03-28 22:54:49	5	5	5	0	10	5	3	2	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Isn t this just what you want to see when you cut open your chicken for your Easter dinner! A bright green slimy chicken...   Seriously unimpressed. The best before date very clearly states the 28th  so it should have been safe to eat on the 27th and even actually today. I dread to think what would have happened if someone had eaten this without realising...   You don t offer refunds without the product being returned apparently  and even if we did keep and return this revolting  gone off  absolutely stinking chicken  all we would have been offered is a refund. Not really good enough is it! Our dinner was completely ruined  and with everything closed for Easter Sunday  there was nothing that we could do...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12670633_10154278756553646_9116342583809828974_n.jpg?oh=517e105e6467c895f8232e4cb37a8eb7&oe=58DD2B93	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12670633_10154278756553646_9116342583809828974_n.jpg?oh=d1b677b6679f419fb754b689a588676f&oe=59173C9E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154278756553646&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-28T20:48:43+0000	1459198123	2016-03-28 22:48:43	0	10	0	0	10	10	8	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No my chosen Bourbon is a Tesco own brand  so I would like to express my disappointment and my utter shock at when approximately two months ago my local Tesco Extra in Dudley had unfortunately ran out of Bourbons (they had the upmarket ones but as I said I don t like those).   Now my first thought was  ok it will be alright I shall return tomorrow to purchase said Bourbons . I have returned most days over the past two months however when I make my way to the biscuit isle hoping and praying I will be able to purchase my desired Bourbons I am greeted by an horrific sight  right next to the custard creams (where said Bourbons usually live) there is simply an empty space  much like the empty space in my heart.   I realise to some it s just a Bourbon but to me it s my morning treat  the one thing I get to look forward to in the morning. it s been two months now and the withdrawal symptoms are bringing to show.  I hope you  Mr Tesco can bring an end to the national shortage of Bourbons.   Thank you					2016-03-28T19:31:05+0000	1459193465	2016-03-28 21:31:05	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I couldn t find anymore in store  just one pack on the side  but at 99p I thought they were a bargain. I allowed my son one as a snack and one later after dinner. Imagine my horror when putting the remaining two away at home....the date on them shows Aug 15!!!! Today is 28th March 2016!!!!!! How on earth are you selling food aimed at babies and toddlers that is 7 (almost 8!) months out of date. My son has had 5 very smelly nappies today and a very red bottom which I had put down to the change of bread we had given him  but now I am not so sure. 😞 I feel awful as a mother to have given him these and disgusted as a customer that you have sold these to me.

The chap on the butcher counter was great fun  my 4 year old was with me & Mr Butcher made a great fuss of him (making my life easier) plus I bought a lovely topside joint  no fat and very tasty pot roasted.

And I m wondering where the chocolate filling is? I wouldn t normally complain and me and my son had one each until we realised there was no chocolate filling. I cut them all in half and none have any filling. My local tesco in Boston Lincolnshire does not seem to sell these anymore and was shocked to see them in Skegness hence I bought some. Just very disappointed. :(	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12417527_10156696648280534_5666273706903023603_n.jpg?oh=0838b8988857c1ba53b7a7046ced2650&oe=59095E45	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12417527_10156696648280534_5666273706903023603_n.jpg?oh=7c978acea5dbe3033c22e7f822c62547&oe=591F6C48	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156696648280534&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-28T19:04:41+0000	1459191881	2016-03-28 21:04:41	6	4	6	0	10	4	2	2	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Do loyal customers get excluded?. I never get points/discounts etc at end of shop. I did when I first shopped online:-) Not happy  will try other on line supermarkets(they prob do the same with new customes  keep them happy for a while then stop offering). There are so many other supermarkets now though I think I could save a fortune).

Why on earth would Tesco still use this in a product that should be enjoyed by everyone? Surely beetroot is a good enough source of red colouring  and then we could all eat them?

Coleman s packet mixes normally 50p but when on either 3 for £1   4 for £2 etc they are suddenly 75p each.  Pedigree dog food 3kg bags were on over not long ago 2 for £10 or £6.99 each yet since offer ended £5 each.   There s been so much coverage from reading standards about supermarkets changing prices to make it look like you re getting better deals when you re not.   I can log in to my account & prove these prices   it seriously misleading & I m sure they ll be more if I looked  these were 2 that stuck in my mind					2016-03-28T17:27:50+0000	1459186070	2016-03-28 19:27:50	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Still thought hey seem to shrink more and more. Were I think 800gm  reduced down over time to just 625gm. Last time I complained the shelf listing said 700gm and that was months ago. Today up for 700gm still.  You told me the suppliers had reduced the size  out of your hands. We all know how supermarkets treat suppliers so don t give me that.  It s no wonder you have problems when you fiddle with prices or pack sizes.  Why not just be honest about it. Barnsley store by the way  don t bother passing my comments to the manager it s the buyers who will stipulate the sizes.  Cheese offers same  price and size up and down  sometimes you have genuine offers though.  You are a bit rubbish really.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/941092_10153710181680186_2185272037713789319_n.jpg?oh=fd23ed306c238b7d3be91522d04a11d0&oe=590C6830	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/941092_10153710181680186_2185272037713789319_n.jpg?oh=2338dbaaddfcec4df091c5206ef6e4cd&oe=59215CCF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153710181680186&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-28T16:10:16+0000	1459181416	2016-03-28 18:10:16	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Like there s enough parent and child parking. We had to park quite far away from the store so that we could open the door wide enough to get my baby out in his car seat  and then when we went to get back in the car someone had parked next to our car making it very difficult to get the car seat back into the car.

I was shopping today at Tesco  Buckingham when I came across this competition! I was buying petit-filous anyway so was excited at the idea of winning a family day out. I followed the instructions and told the cashier about it but she didn t see anything come up on her screen when she scanned them. I then asked at customer services with the same result - the lady suggested I check online.   After some research  this competition finished in 2014!! I found a winners  list via google and then zoomed into this photo to see it ran from 27.08.14-07.10.14!  I understand that I may not have won if I entered during these dates but I am really disappointed that this is still advertised over 18 months since it closed! I got very excited and have spent time inquiring about it!   Could you please see that these adverts are removed to avoid further disappointment! (And if you do feel like giving away one last family day out  I wouldn t say no!! :-) )  Kind regards   Hayley Prudhomme.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12376630_1694255270841657_3208440850275288967_n.jpg?oh=43d794aa78693ef03dafe4ca9f851254&oe=591DA316	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12376630_1694255270841657_3208440850275288967_n.jpg?oh=a19791443823f8130b949501b9f04e34&oe=5921C803	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1694255270841657&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-28T14:30:19+0000	1459175419	2016-03-28 16:30:19	4	6	4	0	10	6	4	2	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t buy fruit very often due to my love of the more unhealthy things in life and the day I do  I receive this poor little fella amongst my lunch. I doubt he expected to spend his last days perched on a plastic fork in my pot of fruit. I m now too nervous to eat the fruit through fear of discovering the rest of  a bugs life  cast.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12512364_10153835905760589_7620750034135310226_n.jpg?oh=22590ade278defd57b5180117fe2a75c&oe=58DCC233	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12512364_10153835905760589_7620750034135310226_n.jpg?oh=530d2ecce0f553ec4ca7d7f79405a876&oe=591A8FD5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153835905760589&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-28T14:25:28+0000	1459175128	2016-03-28 16:25:28	19	5	19	0	24	5	5	0	3	0	17	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought one a couple of years ago. The very strong type and was told at the time it was a bag for life. Went to replace it today and staff say it is not a bag for life.  Car park is awful and quite often has broken bottles because tescos are too bone idle to clear things up.  The staff  although plesent are useless.  The use by dates are about 1 to 2 days on most fresh produce. Obviously this store get over stock from the proper stores. Give me asda any day.					2016-03-28T14:16:28+0000	1459174588	2016-03-28 16:16:28	0	10	0	0	10	10	2	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter walked round the rest of the store with her chosen toy. She was very excited to get it home! As we tried to scan it at the till it wasn t recognised and turned out that they could not sell us the toy as it wasn t registered on the system. My daughter cried her little heart out. Along came Gillian (i don t know her last name) she was amazing!! she came and spoke to my little girl and explained how sorry she was that she couldn t have the toy. I was more than happy with the way Gillian handled the situation... Then she went out of her way to sort the problem and took my little girl to choose a new toy (she picked 2 in the end) and gave us money off for the trouble. So a very massive THANKYOU from one very happy little girl (and me)  xxx					2016-03-28T13:21:41+0000	1459171301	2016-03-28 15:21:41	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My husband took his word as he didn’t have his glasses on but when I checked  it was actually 769g of chicken.  Now  I don’t know about you  but I don’t call that identical and neither will my guests when they sit down to lunch with less meat between them.  If nothing else  it seems logical to provide the customer with at least as much meat as the ordered quantity; 181g is a full portion.

Bad advertising Tesco. Therefore she advised ordering online with next day delivery. i then did what she said and ordered online for next day delivery. I ordered Saturday afternoon  received my email with tracking number. With it being Easter i assumed id receive it in time for my holiday on Tuesday or early Wednesday but contacted Hermes this morning and asked if they knew if Tue OR wed and they said neither - Hermes do NOT do next day delivery - if this is the case WHY has Tesco charged me £5 extra delivery for next day delivery that service doesn t exist. I am now going away with NO bag  as no idea when it will arrive since its not what i paid for!! Really not happy about this!! Really disappointing way to start holiday with the let down on the item i need more than others!!					2016-03-28T08:36:58+0000	1459154218	2016-03-28 10:36:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought 2 half legs of lamb for my Easter dinner  to get them out of the fridge yesterday morning to find them BOTH a disgusting colour and off!!! £12.00 worth of meat  no good. Plus the inconvenience of my roast dinner ruined! My fridge is brand new and I can quite often keep foods past the best before date.. I only purchased them on Friday  so they must have been on the turn before I purchased them!! So thanks Tesco for ruining my Easter Sunday Roast Dinner!!! 😡😡					2016-03-28T06:56:15+0000	1459148175	2016-03-28 08:56:15	0	10	0	0	10	10	2	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was presently surprised to find that they were not only gluten free  but also did not contain any lactose. I looked a bit further  and was delighted to find that the meatballs and burgers where the same!  I enjoyed some delicious burgers tonight  safe in the knowledge there was no gluten or lactose in sight! It s not often I can pick something up up straight off the shelf and be able to eat it  major props to Tesco for that!

So this morning I was greeted by a Lindt gold bunny family egg and opened up the  medium  sized bunny. The chocolate was marbled white but I felt best not to complain and crack on.  So this evening I come to the main part  the actual egg which I can break into pieces and savour. Initially as I felt the outside of the foil I thought I had a broken egg which is a bit disappointing but no problem.  Well my disappointment was going to reach a new level. My egg is melted! MELTED!  I only have half an Easter egg!!   The egg was purchased Friday from your burgess hill store.

Tasteless  waxy and would not fluff or crisp.  Obviously they have been put in the wrong bag or you are selling a cheap substitute.  My roast potatoes were a disaster! I shall take the remainder back to the store.					2016-03-27T19:17:21+0000	1459106241	2016-03-27 21:17:21	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased my husband and myself a tichy chokablok billionaires dynamite egg for Easter  the promise of milk chocolate with honeycomb pieces  chocolate coasted shortcake biscuit and fudge chunks made my eyes light up and I knew me and my husband would be in for a treat on Easter Sunday this being our only egg.  Imagine our delight as we both opened the box and just sat staring at our egg in our hands  drooling over the chocolatey honeycomby fudgy shortcakey goodness before us.  Then we took our first bite and that s when it all went down hill.  Nowhere on the box does it state that the  milk chocolate  would be coffee flavoured  No where does it state that there should be a taste of coffee at all in our Easter egg.  Now my husband is not a coffee drinker  I drink it but I m not a coffee flavoured chocolate fan  My Easter has been ruined and I imagine my 4 nieces I brought the same egg for will not be overly impressed either.  This has spoilt what was shaping up to be a good day Tesco  I hope your happy!  Please in future could you state on your packaging of eggs if the chocolate is coffee flavoured so others do not have to go through the same heartbreak as we have  Yours sincerely  Lindsay shepherd Chocoholic					2016-03-27T18:52:55+0000	1459104775	2016-03-27 20:52:55	0	36	3	1	40	33	10	23	103	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0

I  recall you also have been accused of deliberately paying your suppliers late and forcing them to supply at unsustainably low prices. This has led me to form the opinion that you are a fundamentally dishoust company. You have lost my custom on a permanent basis.					2016-03-27T18:21:13+0000	1459102873	2016-03-27 20:21:13	3	11	3	0	14	11	3	8	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a disabled customer I parked in the required spot  entered the store specifically at the non-food entrance as I didn’t need to be at the main side due to not needing food. The tills clearly state 15 items or less in the non-food area  arriving at the tills a rude person named Michael rudely and loudly told me and my sister in law that  it’s too big to come through here  indicating the slide we had in the trolley was too big! Nowhere on the sign does it state that large items aren’t accepted and I have a picture of this. Yes we had a big trolley with items for both of us and a child with us too  now should that have been the case then it should be clearly signed at the entrance to make customers aware and I would have parked at the main entrance  as opposed to then having to walk the breadth of the store to pay and return to where I had parked with mobility issues! Upon going to the customer services desk to complain there was no manager  people were already waiting for a manager and had been for some time. I didn’t have time to be doing this as I repeat I am disabled and have limited mobility. Having just returned to shopping at Tesco’s after a previous issue which I didn’t raise a complaint about I feel I need to as the till person was blatantly rude. I think that your store needs to retrain staff in customer services  had I have spoken to a customer like that I would have been warned or had disciplinary proceedings taken against me!

The leg of lamb isn t even near the weight I required and has been made up with a separate small leg joint. The individual weights are not listed and the whole idea of a large leg of lamb is to present it at the table in one piece!! I am angry that I now have an array of lamb and it seems from the second smaller joint that I m also paying for additional bone weight....it s totally unacceptable! To add further insult I can buy lamb leg at Netto this weekend for £3.79 per kilo.... This is the first lamb leg I ve seen that has been strung!!!!....why is that? It would appear that a piece of the meat has been taken out and the bone makes up most of the weight..........I m wondering if I should be contacting Trading Standards!!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12321372_1688376138117285_1277769929803033108_n.jpg?oh=9a2b0aaf3eb6ac1b0b927bba4b454701&oe=5916AF96	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12321372_1688376138117285_1277769929803033108_n.jpg?oh=b0c5d7855f4fe35ecb0a4b5403a958cc&oe=591FBE83	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1688376138117285&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-27T12:26:31+0000	1459081591	2016-03-27 14:26:31	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our smaller store has had a few of the value selections removed and there s very little branded goods  what is there is expensive. Barely any money-saving promotions too.  Seriously  what happened to all these in-store savings we were promised when you ended the fuel promotion?! You re beginning to come into line with Sainsburys with your prices for own brand goods but without the quality.  No Tesco  just no. I have bought staple items from Lidl when Tesco was closed and I was amazed when I went to pay  2 bags of shopping cost me just short of £20 when exactly the same shop in Tesco costs well over £30.

They were amazing and great quality. As always let s change something that s not broken.  They now feel disgustingly papery and cheap and after a normal night s sleep our daughter woke up with crystals all over her bum and it s caused irritation. What was a great product that we d used for years (two kids) is just disappointing and disgusting.					2016-03-27T10:22:39+0000	1459074159	2016-03-27 12:22:39	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

And the  new elastic  bit for the back thats states  snug and comfy fit  actually is irritating my child s back and has marks where its rubbing against the skin .. Why faf around with things!

I ordered my online shop to be delivered Friday but when ordering I couldn t order any Dairy free eggs  chocolate bars  buttons  individual cakes or brownies! Absolutely no Dairy free Easter alternatives for my 2year old! So I also took a trip in store because iv always been able to get a good alternative for my son! Nope in store was just as horrendous! I was shown to two dairy free eggs! One was only 65g of white chocolate and cost a whopping £2.50! The other was dark chocolate and £3 but similar size! ( I could however pick up a Easter egg trail bundle inc 16 eggs and clues for £3! For a non dairy child!?!) Still no dairy free chocolate bar  buttons brownies or cakes in free from isle  normal sweet isle or seasonal! Your staff didn t know where else to look and couldn t explain why the sudden lack of Dairy free! There wasn t even spaces on shelves for these items!  Unfortunately dairy free isn t a lifestyle choice for many people  it s an Allergy! So when my sons friends have received brightly coloured  fun looking Easter eggs and chocolate gifts my son has had plain normal looking sweet bags! I m grateful that he s still at an age I can bypass the worst of the Easter hype! But please Tesco sort it out for next year and all the other Allergy mums!					2016-03-27T07:06:08+0000	1459062368	2016-03-27 09:06:08	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But today I witness pure greed whilst at the Tesco s store located in Pitsea  Essex. Myself and my other half were looking at the reduced sections around the store and we had noticed that people had literally filled their trollies so high with reduced food items. So high that other customers thought that the trollies weren t being used by another customer. This customer had over 9 tubs of 1p grapes. Which fair enough if you like grapes go for it but what about everyone else?. I m sure many other customers would agree that you should only be allowed a certain amount of reduced items in your basket/trolley. What about people that struggle to provide for their families and rely on reduced food to get them by? Even if this customer struggled themselves it is still pure greed to have so many items from the reduced section without thinking of other people. And this didn t happen at just one point of my shop at Tesco s it also happened at the bakery reduced where a woman had filled her trolley full of bread and cakes that people then again thought that it was being used to put reduced items in. I think it will be a great idea to start putting a cap on the amount of reduced food you can have on your shopping trip. Less greed. More consideration.

I was genuinely buying many things from a store today thinking they were from a farm...but now I realise I ve been duped by your marketing department. I think it s fair to say  we  your customers  just want some honesty about where our food comes from.					2016-03-27T00:02:00+0000	1459036920	2016-03-27 01:02:00	1	4	1	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately this thin cut beef steaks were a let down in both departments.  The top two steaks were acceptable however the lower two were predominantly grizzle.   They were inedible  even my dog turned his nose up at them.  I know that they aren t the most expensive steaks and there is the old adage  You only get what you pay for  but I definitely expected better from TESCO.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/11218154_1045260768866402_4893780653679739421_n.jpg?oh=eb83f03aec34b82fb9dc2afdb7de5690&oe=59059E1E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11218154_1045260768866402_4893780653679739421_n.jpg?oh=a339d55559bde439ad0923ffc74a9d5c&oe=59225C0B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1045260768866402&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-26T21:42:06+0000	1459028526	2016-03-26 22:42:06	1	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

Milk prices are at an all time low with many farmers going out of business each week.  Beef prices are falling through the floor.   Surely this means you  as a British Company  can buy at a lower price and support our farmers instead of importing cheap carcasses and labelling them as produced in England when in fact they have only been cut up in England?  Come on Tesco.  Support your customers - dont put them out of business					2016-03-26T20:39:32+0000	1459024772	2016-03-26 21:39:32	6	0	6	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not a single amount of the lamb in this half price offer  or on the end of any aisles was British. The use of end of aisle sale tactics shows that you have no regard for british lamb  or else it would be placed here instead of these New Zealand options.   Please dont disregard me with one of your standard  we need to supplement our british lamb with that from other countries  response!  Why not place Welsh lamb at the end of the aisles and promote good british produce?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1689238_10153577414936985_1464561183211661514_n.jpg?oh=f287d528c1242d3ad142ead2cc0193f8&oe=591EDA26	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/1689238_10153577414936985_1464561183211661514_n.jpg?oh=02feb2ea31a7e1771d10b8e44d5e607f&oe=59238B5A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153577414936985&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-26T20:05:51+0000	1459022751	2016-03-26 21:05:51	47	11	47	4	62	11	7	4	18	0	47	0	0	0	0	0	0

She was so bubbly  full of smiles & very helpful (She found it funny that I brought a whole case of wine) I couldn t see her name badge so we went straight to customer service to ask for her name. They said it was JASMINE. They also said she had  had four other compliments YESTERDAY. Thank You Jasmine. I hope you get to hear of your compliments. Keep up the good work Jasmine & Tesco xxx	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12920358_10153612485372875_8943553256699625076_n.jpg?oh=80724da7cc717ee9b96c40f57600dc9e&oe=5922CC53	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12920358_10153612485372875_8943553256699625076_n.jpg?oh=c1b3bddafa9b065da63696897153111c&oe=58D9AD5E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153612485372875&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-26T19:59:07+0000	1459022347	2016-03-26 20:59:07	3	1	3	1	5	1	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Left my wife s car with the Car Wash people lunch time today  walked across to Next then walked back to go in Tesco. As we walked past the car wash area on the pavement outside (& above) we were shocked to see one of the attendants rooting through a bag my wife had in the boot. (The car was backed in to the car wash bay so we had a very clear view from above). He had a good root around in this bag for at least 30 seconds while we were watching  found nothing valuable so carried on cleaning. (So shocked we didn t think quickly enough to video him). When confronted  none of them understood any English.... Managed to convince him (and his colleagues) that he was a thief and he eventually said sorry. I ve used this car wash before  when it first started they always logged each vehicle in on a tablet device and issued receipts but recently no logging-in or receipts have been happening so that makes you wonder how much of the takings are actually going in the till  and how many items have gone missing from people s cars. Have complained to Tesco but waiting to see how they progress the matter. No one has been in touch yet and this guy is probably still working on site. The Car Wash is operated by a franchise called  Waves  but their publicity leads you to believe it is operated by Tesco.					2016-03-26T18:45:35+0000	1459017935	2016-03-26 19:45:35	1	8	1	1	10	8	3	5	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a turkey crown to be delivered on Wednesday and sadly it was out of stock. Not too panicked as I still had a couple of days to buy one but no need just as we were having dinner that evening there was a message on the answerphone saying they were sending someone over to Elmers End to pick up our crown and deliver it that night if that was OK with us. And to top it all when he arrived he had bought 2 and no charge. Amazing!!!!!					2016-03-26T18:35:50+0000	1459017350	2016-03-26 19:35:50	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not to mention the game industry the UK produces millions of game birds and venison which is a healthy organic and cheap option of meat but not on your shelves    And not to mention the fruit and veg industries as well    What I would like to see happen which I m sure the majority of your customers would also like to see happen  is that Tesco makes a pledge to buy more of British produce  if it can be produced in the UK it should be sourced in the UK at a fair price for the producers creating a fair trade for UK farmers  if it can be UK sourced 80% of the product must come from UK farms  obviously there is stock that can not be UK sourced such as bananas and oranges  but there is plenty of products that could and should be. Support the UK farmers and the UK Will support you    Stand by your nation and set a precedent that all others can follow    So please listen to your customers and stand by the nation that has made you who you are  this would create more jobs in the UK and will benefit the UK and in turn will benefit you with customers becoming loyal to your stores and not moving to other alternatives					2016-03-26T18:30:21+0000	1459017021	2016-03-26 19:30:21	13	3	13	6	22	3	1	2	1	0	13	0	0	0	0	0	0

You only need to walk along the bays in Madeley  Telford to see 2 out of 3 cars are not displaying blue badges. Even taking into account that a few may forget  that means 50% are not in need of that space; this means people genuinely in need are unable to park and that means you are losing customers!					2016-03-26T18:16:23+0000	1459016183	2016-03-26 19:16:23	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The lids can be taken off and the pots can be split from the pack without the other or actual pot breaking open! Also the 2 healthy living soups the tomato and chicken noodle ones taste very close to the heinz ones! very nice flavor and not too watery! Decent price too! As a lot of healthier foods are rather expensive! My only flaw is the yogurts seem to have changed taste wise their flavor tastes not as strong and tastes sort of artificial. But otherwise thumbs up!					2016-03-26T17:31:58+0000	1459013518	2016-03-26 18:31:58	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Don t know if stock issues  but I ve heard others having same issues.   Have you stopped selling Swedish Glace? Are you planning to replace it with a different brand or just not sell an alternative to dairy ice cream?  This is the second time we ve been with no oatly chocolate milk. You still have oatly milks as well as many varieties of plant milk. Only sell chocolate milk in lunchbox carton size (3 pack). Please bring it back or stock more of it  or koko chocolate.   You seem to have stopped selling the lemon and lime provamel yogurts. Again you sell the plain one and coconut. The lemon and lime was amazing. As were the other flavoured yogurts.   And now to the major gripe which is cereals. It is a constant battle and the ever changing recipies are maddening. You have followed Kellogs and Sainsbury s by ruining nearly every one by thr addition of vitamin D. The raspberry malties were OK until recently then in came vit D. It s OK I ll just have plain malties  and within two weeks vitamin D has sneaked into those as well. Unlike Nestle s originals. Please get a vegan vitamin D or allow people to supplement themselves  it is maddening.   You ve done a lot of good things of late but all these things add up  if you remove our staples we may as well just shop entirely elsewhere.					2016-03-26T17:20:59+0000	1459012859	2016-03-26 18:20:59	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After walking past them  one member went and got 2 chocolate eggs for both children and the other phoned for the easter bunny to come and chat with them. It made the rest of the shopping trip so much easier 😁					2016-03-26T16:27:21+0000	1459009641	2016-03-26 17:27:21	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s ridiculous having to call up every week and complain about the quality and / or shelf-life of the products they ve picked for us.  Whilst we appreciate the refunds that are given out  we d much prefer to have decent quality  long shelf-life goods than having to go back out and do the shopping after having already been and done the shopping online to specifically avoid going into the store!  This week has taken the biscuit more than ever... check out theof the photo attached!  There s more life in a pensioners johnson.  As Facebook is being a bit useless and not allowing me to upload multiple photos I m going to have to post a few more messages... but really.  Ordered two parsnips  these ones were so pathetic that once peeled there ll be no more than an inch left!  Whatever people might say... size does matter!

It may be and Ireland only phenomenon but just in case it is more wide spread I m posting here.  For the record I am a happy TESCO / TESCOMobile customer and just want to warn other of a scam that may cost them money.  It claims  TESCO  are considering opening a new center [sic] in Dublin and asks 4 inane questions. After getting 4 responses it asks the name of the UK supermarket with a green logo (ASDA). This takes you to a screen that asks for your mobile number and at the bottom  in tiny type face  it says  €7.50 per month draw entry fee  plus  €2.50 per text .  It is run by Mad Prizes* and on retracing my steps there are disclaimers all the way through saying the  survey  is not affiliated with the retailer or product manufacturer named. This leads me to believe there are other similar scams knocking around.  I have no idea how I got to this particular  scam-petition  site as I take the usual precautions browser-wise. It s been a while since I saw a new scam-petition.  The logos and colours are realistic enough to lull the unwary into a false sense of security.   And hey  let s be careful out there; do it them before they do it us.  (Hill Street Blues 198x)  PMMCG					2016-03-26T16:10:51+0000	1459008651	2016-03-26 17:10:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst shopping we had a very near miss to what could of been a very serious incident for my son. One of your employees was pushing a large heavy cage quickly up the middle of the Isle.  I had stopped to look at products and as the cage passed us the door which wasn t locked swung round smashing in to our trolley centimetres from my son s head and face. If my son hadn t slightly changed his position in the trolley seconds before  this would have been a serious incident.  Both of us were quite shaken and received a  sorry about that  from your employee which to be honest didn t sound very sorry .. i also reported it to the customer service where I received a half hearted sorry and was told the cage doors are supposed to be locked while moving. My complaint/issue was NOT recorded either which shows that Tesco doesn t really care about what happens to its customers whilst in Tesco premises. I would hate to think of the outcome if my son had been seriously hurt! a half hearted sorry is not good enough in either situation.

You advertise your lamb with a Union Jack flag  but there is not one single piece of British lamb in the store! You have lost yet another customer because of your lack of loyalty to British farmers and your constant misleading tactics.  Why are you using the Union Jack to advertise NZ lamb to your customers? Profits before honesty.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12439111_10153659595929285_8919621366498294931_n.jpg?oh=55c287e0d1228cf1db86808f03ad96b0&oe=592107B8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12439111_10153659595929285_8919621366498294931_n.jpg?oh=9bcf5183a624f74a2aeda9b04bccf931&oe=5923025E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153659595929285&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-26T15:16:08+0000	1459005368	2016-03-26 16:16:08	11	5	14	0	19	5	4	1	3	0	11	0	0	0	0	3	0

Tesco Pet insurance sent a letter today saying that our payments would increase from £15.99 per month to £18.74 from April. We were unhappy with this as we haven t claimed anything. So we decided to look it up online. When we put in the same details on our current policy on the tesco site as if we were looking for a new policy it was only £8.90 per month!! We have cancelled our policy and restarted it but have better cover and half the excess for £12.27 per month! This means that yearly it was £224 and is now £146 for a better policy and half the excess! We are still with Tesco but I would like to ask them why they are trying to cheat their customers out of money!?! I wonder how many people would not check and let it run at the price they say. Surely it counts as fraud!!  Please can somebody contact me to explain this situation.					2016-03-26T15:14:10+0000	1459005250	2016-03-26 16:14:10	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Even though its on offer at a reduced price from £1.50 to £1.00. Because it is mostly WATER and SUGAR with not enough carrot and I could not see or taste any corriander. Oh & it has CONCENTRATED ORANGE JUICE in it. A WASTE OF MONEY. Why dont you use all the big or odd shaped CARROTS and actually add CORRIANDER and seasoning and then you would have very good soup. And it is NOT creamy at all. Maybe a cow walked past the carrot field.					2016-03-26T14:36:33+0000	1459002993	2016-03-26 15:36:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered some items through Tesco direct for our new house and specifically booked for them to come last Saturday as we work Monday to Friday. The items were due to be delivered by yodel. We were home all day and at around 4.45pm we looked at the yodel tracker and it stated that they tried to deliver and left a card. We were in the flat and no one rang us or buzzed on the apartment intercom and certainly no calling card was left. I then rang your team to complain and was advised that they would book a redelivery for us after 5pm on Tuesday although this could not be guaranteed as yodel don t work like that apparently. My partner then took Tuesday off work to make sure we could get this delivery. The same thing then happened. The tracker said they had tried to deliver and left a calling card. Needless to say we had no phone call  no one rang the buzzer and no calling card was left. My partner had wasted his day off.   I rang your call centre again to try and cancel the order and the lady I spoke to said why don t we just try one more time. So she rescheduled for today Saturday the 26th of March. We have been home all morning and the exact same thing has now happened. There is no possible way yodel have been here as we have been home each time. If there was such an issue with the address they should have called us on the contact number provided. I m so disappointed and have now cancelled the order.

I went in with my daughters last Saturday at the time advertised for the Easter egg hunt. My daughters were very disappointed to be told we had the wrong day and it was today at 11. I promised to take them back  which I did today. When we got there we were told by shop floor staff that they knew nothing about this and nothing was happening today. Again very disappointed daughters. We then went to check with the customer service desk and spoke to Josh. He contacted another lady (didn t get her name but she was dressed as an egg!).  She then asked us to wait 5 minutes and sent Josh to hide some eggs for my girls! They literally went out of their way to do this for us. We are so grateful and now have some happy girls. Thank you so much.					2016-03-26T12:08:42+0000	1458994122	2016-03-26 13:08:42	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I like my coffees and know what is a latte and isn t I go to costa quite a lot and do not have this problem neither do I have this problem if I have a Starbucks when I am working in London					2016-03-26T11:53:21+0000	1458993201	2016-03-26 12:53:21	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As the waist band has now been changed to the elasticated ones I m finding they fall off regularly. Also they don t seem to be anywhere near as absorbent and we are constantly having leakages. They just don t seem to fit him very well anymore. Such a shame I only use tesco nappies with my kids (and with one on the way would be using them for much longer) but I m going to have to shop elsewhere for them due to this change. (My son will be in nappies for a while due to a disability so the change is not a welcome one)					2016-03-26T06:47:49+0000	1458974869	2016-03-26 07:47:49	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday  after a quick after school shop with two demons in tow  I realised I couldn t find my car keys. Asked at customer services and security  went back to the till  thinking I had perhaps dropped them when I took my purse out my pocket  no luck. Started to retrace our steps  still no sign. Asked a member of staff in one of the aisles if any keys had been handed to him. At this point the store manager started to help us look  along with other staff. The manager escorted us round the store retracing our steps and helped me look through our shopping etc. in search of the missing key. He came out in the rain to look around my car and had staff look through baskets and shelves trying to locate them. He had a member of staff take my kids to the cafe and gave them drawing books to keep them entertained. He waited with me while I called round to check my insurance and get in contact with my family. We live quite far out in the countryside  and the nearest bus stop is the next village along from our little hamlet. As we couldn t find the key I decided to get a taxi home to find the spare. Instead  the absolute star who was looking after my kids (and who s insurance covered it!) offered to take me and my children home  and another member of staff lent us a child seat for my 3 year old. I had to leave the car over night as my Dad had been working away  and I couldn t find the spare till this morning. I can t believe how helpful all the staff were and how they went out of there way to assist me and my children. Absolutely fantastic! Really made a stressful situation so much easier than it could have been.   I went back to thank the manager today  and have promised to give them feedback on your website  but wanted to share it publicly as well. All fabulous people!!!					2016-03-25T22:21:41+0000	1458944501	2016-03-25 23:21:41	203	20	216	15	251	19	12	7	24	0	196	13	0	0	0	0	0

It s was drizzling and a bit of a horrible day and the car park was pretty busy! Eventually I got a parent and child space! I grabbed the baby in my arms and my little girl by the hand and briskly went into the store! We had a pleasant shop and on our way out we tried to make our way quickly to the car! I noticed a tesco employee (in uniform) going to her car! I noticed she was alone without children as she started to put things in  her boot! I was struggling to get the kids into the car and the shopping in the boot without getting soaked! Another employee then came over to her and said jokingly  didn t know you had kids  and she replied  I don t but loads of us park here  I don t care!  Whilst I m not on a crusade about mother and baby car park spaces (and blokes in vans that park there annoy me too) the fact it was an employee who saw me struggling and a colleague making a joke about her not having kids and parking there really annoyed me and think you should have a word with your staff!! She was a middle aged woman with brown hair and glasses and her number plate is in the photo!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12494933_10156735326240080_3446225222863110246_n.jpg?oh=477690b38330391b4c390d24b054d6fe&oe=58D7252A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12494933_10156735326240080_3446225222863110246_n.jpg?oh=3c82bd887b9f6197c8e5e7ee59ec4a4d&oe=5914305E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156735326240080&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-25T22:17:11+0000	1458944231	2016-03-25 23:17:11	31	12	33	1	46	12	10	2	14	0	31	0	0	0	0	2	0

Today when I went to collect my order I was presented with a lovely bunch of flowers  compliments of Tesco  for my wife who has been poorly for some time. It transpired that the two lovely ladies who run the click and collect service at the Chelmsford Princess Road site had nominated me knowing my wife s circumstances. So thank you Tesco but especially thank you to Maxine & Amanda whose kind thoughts and words have been greatly appreciated over the last few months. I am pleased to say that my wife s treatment appears to be working & she is on the road to recovery.					2016-03-25T21:20:21+0000	1458940821	2016-03-25 22:20:21	6	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered 2 Easter items which you advertised as promo goods but failed to deliver. 1  Cadbury mini egg gateau ordered  small bag of mini eggs delivered  2  Tesco Easter cupcakes pack of 12 ordered  4 Cadbury egg n spoon delivered. How on earth they can be called substitutions God only knows. When I rang your customer service dept and explained what had happened he initially laughed  I said its fair from funny. I am convinced either you don t care or you must employ half witts.					2016-03-25T20:35:31+0000	1458938131	2016-03-25 21:35:31	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For the first time in nearly 3 years I could take my daughter shopping by myself today  thanks to you getting the new GO2 trolley. My daughter has quadriplegic cerebral palsy and is unable to sit in a normal trolley as she can t hold herself up or even get her legs in due to stiffness. This is the best thing ever to a parent like me. It s going to mean I can take my daughter shopping alone and not need 2 people to push her chair and the trolley. We are so grateful you have got one of these  thank u it means the world to us xxxx	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10982825_1554749108156544_3128703725378831672_n.jpg?oh=d31ccb9110f0efd4d69f9738b9587d1c&oe=5911FB27	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10982825_1554749108156544_3128703725378831672_n.jpg?oh=ebdbd203db255e4ddd0a56ed4a7cab82&oe=5923F732	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1554749108156544&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-25T20:03:37+0000	1458936217	2016-03-25 21:03:37	1600	54	1663	112	1829	48	40	8	71	0	1571	58	0	2	0	0	0

It s just taken 35 minutes for a parcel to be brought down to the car park at the Dunfermline Fire Station store and the only reason I got it at all was because I ended up phoning a regional service centre who got in touch with the store.  Apparently they weren t aware I was there despite printing me a ticket telling me to wait at my car and me repeatedly pressing the call button?? Not great and certainly not easy with a child in the car for what you think will be a quick trip - sort it out Tesco. 😡					2016-03-25T19:17:58+0000	1458933478	2016-03-25 20:17:58	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I get size 6 for my eldest and 5 for my youngest. I ordered them like normal in my tescos shop a few weeks ago and we noticed that the size 6 s had changed. But they fit much better so we were happy. But I ve noticed a few times when changing my son s bum it leaves little crystals all over his bum and ever since he has had a slightly red bum. The nappies don t look like they are split and aren t too full. Please tell this is a faulty batch of nappies and not how they are going to be all the time.

The girl on the checkout simply rolled her eyes and asked him for payment. He was very confused and distressed. I said to the girl are you going to get him some more milk or shall I? She tutted and stropped off. I got some blue tissue and cleaned the floor  the belt and then tried to clean the gentleman up as well. He kept saying sorry and people in the queue were getting impatient which upset him all the more. The checkout girl returned with his milk  plonked it in his basket. He was very confused so I helped him with his money and helped him get himself together and he left. I was disgusted. This young persons only concern was for her tea break. I told her and the impatient person behind that they ought to be ashamed of themselves. He clearly needed reassurance and assistance. Isn t that what your staff are paid to do? This person had zero customer service skills  the most miserable disposition  didn t smile  say hello  offer help with packing and most importantly  when asking for payment forgot the magic words PLEASE and THANKYOU!!!! What a shocking advert for Tesco. I won t be shopping there again. I tried to locate a senior member of staff but  no one was available 					2016-03-25T18:02:39+0000	1458928959	2016-03-25 19:02:39	3	31	5	2	38	30	24	6	14	0	3	0	0	0	0	2	0

An elderly lady had a fall in the car park  & not only did 3 members of staff stay with her  bandage her head up (she had sliced her head & nose) but they also went out of their way to contact the ladies daughter & because she didn t have her own transport  they got 2 members of their staff to drive to get the ladies daughter so that she could get in the ambulance with her mum & go to hospital with her. They was all so lovely to the lady   myself & family thought that they deserved some appreciation. (I am not a relative of the lady that fell but we knew her & witnessed it all) WELL DONE tescos Beeston!!!

Taken back to the shop collected it from  told to take to another shop! They refused to deal with it  they called the manufacturer who asked for photographic evidence?? Seriously how could that be possible when it was boxed  plus why would your own shops not deal with it. I was under the impression the sale was between the shop and the buyer not the buyer and the manufacturer! Now stuck with a gazebo that can t be used and also cost £99 that has not been refunded! Can someone please advise me of the correct procedure.					2016-03-25T17:12:18+0000	1458925938	2016-03-25 18:12:18	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Nice to see the racks looking tidy compared to before when some newspapers were found slung on top of others. Did my lottey too to claim 2 free tickets for getting 2 numbers in a neighbour s line. Just imagine if I was one of many who had won £15 for matching 5 numbers (as I ve read on page 7 of the Daily Mail. I would have gone berserk too for Camelot s error. Some have said that these changes (which were made in October last year) should be scrapped. What I wish Camelot would do is to keep the new prizes handed out now but go back to the original numbers 1-49 instead.					2016-03-25T14:20:43+0000	1458915643	2016-03-25 15:20:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The only thing Tesco is committed to is your profit margin  and clearly  whoever is responsible for both the Red Tractor assurance scheme and the  additional Tesco welfare standards  need to take a long  hard look at themselves if they consider the horrific environments caged hens endure of a high standard and in the best interests of their welfare! There is only one way for Tesco to prove that they really care about this inhumane treatment of these birds  and that is to stop selling eggs produced by them with immediate effect. If Sainsbury’s and Waitrose can do it  why can’t you?!					2016-03-25T12:59:01+0000	1458910741	2016-03-25 13:59:01	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Since I found out I was a coeliac I was told to try Tesco in Widnes. I was a bit dubious about it but can I say I have been impressed. Your gluten free selection is basic but its the best I ve found. I ve tried Morrisons and  M&S but you definitely have a better selection of food. The fact I can have cake with friends and family who have said your gf cakes are better than non gf cakes says a lot. I now look forward to my visits but really need to get a new club card.					2016-03-25T12:38:45+0000	1458909525	2016-03-25 13:38:45	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

IMPORTANT please can you investigate the  new design  of the Tesco loves baby ASAP they are awful you have made them thinner both my kids who are in nappies are leaking since wearing this new design the last few days and they never ever leaked with the old design. My family who have kids/babies have noticed their babies are leaking and shopping elsewhere for nappies. Please see photo! The packaging is the same but for some reason Tesco loves baby nappies have been made worse (green packet)you can visually see how bad the design are. The elastic where they wee is so narrow it doesn t protect them whatsoever  they are so thin now and there is a random elastic at the top that has shrunk the size. It Makes my youngest baby itch too and his back has gone red because of it  there is no need for elastic on their back? Babies have sensitive skin that part should be smooth. The inner legs are ok as it is creased there and the elastic their keeps the shape in so the wee stays in but you have made it so narrow too!!Please let me know and keep me informed if you will be making the old design again so I can let everyone know in my family and the 8 000+ mama fb group I am part of who have noticed too.

When I went to buy some today you have brought in  Redmere Farms  (Is this a real farm?) which is not ready washed and is not microwavable. How is this a benefit to customers? So now I have to wash it and then cook it in a saucepan( which I will also have to wash afterwards). To cap it all it has gone back to £1 when it had gone down to 70-79p  so more expensive as well.  Shame on you Tesco  no wonder you are losing customers.					2016-03-25T12:08:50+0000	1458907730	2016-03-25 13:08:50	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Cleverboxes are one of many  Tesco partners    i didn t know they existed although Tesco s answer to that was  well you should have read the small print . Now when i go online to buy i don t expect to have to read all the small print on a retailers site for fear of being mislead  key facts should be prominently and clearly displayed (on the Tesco website there was a small Cleverboxes logo) i expected better from Tesco. I asked Tesco if they recieved any profit from my sale although i can t get a straight answer on that but they said  Tesco allow partner companies to sell on our website as a way of showcasing smaller companies products  now i don t for one minute believe that Tesco are allowing rival companies to steal their customers off their website out of the goodness of their hearts with no profit going to Tesco. I bought off the Tesco website  they had my money and i believe profited from that sale  that makes them responsible. maybe the CEO could make this point clear about profits. I have now had sent 9 emails  had 6 or 7 telephone conversations  several FB posts and are still in the same situation  i think the tactic now is to make me feel as if i am being unreasonable.					2016-03-25T10:58:36+0000	1458903516	2016-03-25 11:58:36	0	3	0	1	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This member of staff loudly stated that he  shouldn t have to look at those people when he s eating  and  they should build a town for all the disabled people to live . When my partner tried to explain how completely insulting that was he aggressively said he was entitled to his opinion and it s freedom of speech.  Maybe some education schemes should be in place so this kind of ignorance doesn t get paired with the Tesco brand and your customers don t have to listen to it.  We both found it incredibly upsetting and shocking that someone could be so hateful and ignorant.					2016-03-25T10:09:53+0000	1458900593	2016-03-25 11:09:53	69	51	110	7	168	48	18	30	73	0	68	1	0	0	5	34	0

Having done the Easter shop online from my sick bed this week I was obviously delighted to be called at 7.30am to be told that your Sunderland store have no Turkey Crowns and would I like 4 Turkey breasts instead!  We never had this problem when our deliveries came from Durham but ever since Sunderland opened the reliability of deliveries has nosedived. I should have known better.  Hey ho. At least my husband was woken nice and early so that he could go to Sainsburys and buy the Turkey Crown we need for our Family Easter.  I am at the point of giving up ordering online  especially for Holidays.					2016-03-25T08:35:39+0000	1458894939	2016-03-25 09:35:39	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was particularly concerned about the fact that bars of Cadbury Fairtrade chocolate don t actually have to contain Fairtrade Cocoa. As long as the company buy Fairtrade Cocoa it can be used in anything. I am asking this because I know Tesco do a lot of very good work with schools (Farm to Fork) which includes Fairtrade products and unknowingly you are encouraging us to maybe buy these products not realising the above.					2016-03-25T08:24:34+0000	1458894274	2016-03-25 09:24:34	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

And I m not impressed with them!! They are not the same as normal  it s as if something is missing! I shall send a photo of the same nappies I have here and the ones I brought today! I now have to go back to one of your stores to return them! Which is an inconvenience to me especially with a 7 month old baby! This is something I didn t need to do! In the photos attached you will be able to clearly see the difference! Many thanks Laura.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12107043_846459688796342_2687700586723561196_n.jpg?oh=7829e14aa58a7b63e97ec2b68d15c8e6&oe=5921D640	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12107043_846459688796342_2687700586723561196_n.jpg?oh=149f5fdc755bb5a7b4cbc36884ba12a7&oe=590D99BF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=846459688796342&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-24T21:27:06+0000	1458854826	2016-03-24 22:27:06	4	7	4	4	15	6	4	2	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered 10 bottles of wine yesterday taking advantage of the 25% off 6 or more bottles which was clearly promoted on their website for the wine I ordered. The order was delivered today and guess what  the discount was not applied. I spent 20 mins getting through to customer support only to be told that the promotion had been removed from that particular wine so I was billed the full amount. Customer services  response was that Tesco can remove a promotion at any time and would not honour the price advertised as the delivery was made today. In my limited experience  if a product is promoted and listed as having a discount applicable  then the retailer should honour that; it appears that Tesco has no honour. So my warning  if this post is not removed by Tesco  is to proceed cautiously as you may be charged more than you anticipated!! So Beware!					2016-03-24T21:26:26+0000	1458854786	2016-03-24 22:26:26	0	8	0	0	8	7	2	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please don t blame the shelf stacker  it happens way too often on too many so called offers that incorrect similar product is place right beside the special. This is across numerous stores and product types.  It is underhand and daylight robbery of people who don t check their bills and trust your signage.  Please don t bother with a canned response  just cop on.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10363832_10204443505048082_6677133513819647590_n.jpg?oh=b136ef406438a71f99137684bf97a7ca&oe=59198FC0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10363832_10204443505048082_6677133513819647590_n.jpg?oh=3600ececef3ed5a834116062ba85c15d&oe=5912E9CD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204443505048082&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-24T20:49:50+0000	1458852590	2016-03-24 21:49:50	18	5	18	0	23	5	1	4	2	0	18	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tonight I went in with my two kids (5 and 3) my daughter  the youngest one was crying and he went out of his way to make her smile and found some of the free fruit that the store offers for children. He chatted the whole time and made both my kids smile. We saw him later in the store and he stopped again to say  that s better smiles all round . What an absolutely lovely man  there are not enough people like him. When talking he got short of breath  apologised and Explained he had recently had a heart attack and yet he was still smiles and working hard. His name was Paul and I hope you recognise what a fantastic asset to your company you have in him.					2016-03-24T19:43:44+0000	1458848624	2016-03-24 20:43:44	598	45	607	32	684	44	39	5	150	0	596	9	0	0	0	0	0

I had an item missing from my online delivery so rang the customer service number to be told they would get the item out to me and call me to let me know. Waited in all day and nothing  when I called they hadn t even passed the call through to Scunthorpe and had closed my issue as resolved! When we were put through to tesco Scunthorpe not only did my item get hand delivered but came with Easter eggs for both the kids  a chicken and some fruit to try from the new range  plus a £10 voucher. Brilliant service from your Scunthorpe store tesco  shame about your customer service team though.					2016-03-24T18:46:54+0000	1458845214	2016-03-24 19:46:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is a deceitful marketing ploy and whoever thought of it  whoever agreed it  and whoever implemented it  should be dismissed. How on earth can we trust a company that does this to its loyal shoppers - of which I WAS one!

Well they lied I got it fix once but when my grandson broke it again by dropping a cup on the screen and cracked it I was told the protection plan does not cover it  it will only cover 20.46 and that I would have to get it done by a local computer shop or i could send it to them and they would send me a voucher to redeem in tesco.

This is a very dubious if not devious practice as these key facts should be made much clearer not hidden in the reams of small print. Tesco apart from returning emails and phone calls will have nothing to do with the problem saying it is not their responsibility  in my world whoever takes your money sold it to you. I contacted Cleverboxes who told me to contact Hewlett Packard  i did not see why it was now MY problem to do all the work to get it repaired so i declined  they have now got back to me saying they will send it for repair but can t give me any idea how long i will be without it  6 weeks 6 months they don t know  if that is the case i have asked for a replacement but they seem reluctant to do this. So  beware of buying from Tesco  partners  as when things go wrong they won t want to know  i did ask if they got a share of the profits from their  partner  sales but can t get anyone at Tesco to answer that question  i would be amazed if they allow people to sell from their website out of the goodness of their hearts.. s.harvey					2016-03-24T16:42:20+0000	1458837740	2016-03-24 17:42:20	0	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

This is the third time I ve found this product  in this store  on the shelves whilst being out of date. It is difficult enough to shop when having coeliac disease  and it s not made any easier when almost half of the displayed product you want to buy is so out of date.  I hope the rotation issue in this store is properly addressed  and staff are made aware that this is a fresh product which spoils just as easily as non-gluten free crumpets  before someone is made ill by this.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12063719_10207885963014484_1882640154736588697_n.jpg?oh=1fda3a72e00d3a34118bd2a5704e449e&oe=590CCB95	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12063719_10207885963014484_1882640154736588697_n.jpg?oh=dc1ddff253a70751d7c2c59017fc2e52&oe=591F44E1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207885963014484&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-24T16:41:40+0000	1458837700	2016-03-24 17:41:40	7	6	7	1	14	6	3	3	2	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just ordered wine and when i went to collect it they had replaced the bottles of wine with a bottle £2.00 less and said i had to accept it as a replacement.  When I questioned why would i order an £8.00 bottle of wine and then accept £6.00 bottle of wine I was told that is what Tesco do.   They have now told me that I have to wait upto 10 days to get my money back even though took my payment immediately.   I spoke to Nile(GP10) - Customer Service Supervisor who obiously has a training need.   I was told I had to meet the driver of Tesco in Baguley carpark to pick up my order - it was pouring down and I had to wait for 45 minutes nly to be told that the Manager of the store where the order was packed would not speak to me.   Please do not order any wine as they accept the order then tell you its not in stock and replace with cheaper wine.					2016-03-24T15:40:22+0000	1458834022	2016-03-24 16:40:22	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I really thought things were improving and have been very pro changes at my local store Where staff have always been great.   Noticed this on some raspberries the othe day and thought how early we were producing in Uk.  Looked closer and there was the Spanish details. Didn t buy.   Wish we didn t get treated like idiots. There s no need for this. And if you didn t read closer it certainly looks like it could be from uk origin.

I always have my shopping delivered because I m disabled. ...but I am fed up of having to complain after every delivery because everything arrives un bagged!!!! I specifically ask for bagged because I m disabled and everytime I complain I get told they will investigate ....and I ve had nothing back!!! Today a delivery arrived and over 60% wasn t bagged again...the delivery driver heard me complaining and with an arrogant attitude he stated sarcastically he would take all my shopping back just to be bagged!!! I phoned tesco and complained AGAIN and been advised YET AGAIN  that it will be investigated. ....I spend so much money with tesco and as a customer I don t see why I should tolerate a bad attitude and repeatedly have to phone up after every single delivery to complain about my shopping not being bagged!!!! I am sick of being the nag and the complainer. ...best part is when some of my things are bagged I end up with fresh food bagged with bleach or my soft produce is dumped at the bottom of a bag with heavy stuff on top!!!! Seriously tesco sort it out cos your about to lose a valued customer...... I expect at least my things to be bagged seem as it s one of the options and I shouldn t be left in extreme agony bagging it myself....I m sick of noone listening 😞😞😞😞😞😞					2016-03-24T11:29:56+0000	1458818996	2016-03-24 12:29:56	0	18	0	0	18	17	2	15	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The made-up names are Woodside  Willow and Boswell farms on labelling for pork  chicken and beef  as well as Nightingale and Redmere on salad and vegetable items  Rosedene on berries  apples and pears and Suntrail Farms on a range of imported fruit.  Tesco is using the names on seven new brands which were launched on Monday.  You know it worries me when a Brand named supermarket who years ago I had complete trust in is following marketing practices that leave me questioning their marketing.					2016-03-24T11:24:30+0000	1458818670	2016-03-24 12:24:30	7	3	7	0	10	3	2	1	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Wonderful service. Thank you.					2016-03-24T09:27:43+0000	1458811663	2016-03-24 10:27:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just pointed out to one man that he d parked in the wrong place (Tesco Infirmary Road  Sheffield) as he had no child  and he told me forcefully  in front of my young daughter  that he was allowed to park there by Tesco as he was picking things up?  I think this sends the wrong message to the rest of your customers. If they see one person parking in the few parent and child spaces  they ll think it s fair game for them too. I often struggle to get a space where I can open the door wide enough to get my child out of her car seat  I think you need to rethink this agreement - if he was telling the truth  that is!					2016-03-24T09:17:24+0000	1458811044	2016-03-24 10:17:24	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m 24 weeks pregnant and was paying for my items when I feeling faint  the manager and security guards sat me down  gave me water and looked after me. If it wasn t for them I would have fallen and hurt myself or the baby.

The staff in your South Wigston store are a lot friendlier and chattier than they used to be which is really nice.  I went in with my mum yesterday who is usually an Asda shopper and she commented on how much friendlier Tesco is than Asda.  2. The new restaurant is excellent.  The food is really good - so far I ve had sausage and mash and a cheeseburger (not on the same visit) and both were really well cooked and tasty with generous portions.  Being one of the few places without a Costa Coffee (except for a machine in a nearby petrol station) it s really nice to be able to go into Tesco and get a decent cup of coffee.					2016-03-24T08:24:51+0000	1458807891	2016-03-24 09:24:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On monday evening i visited your elmers end branch to pick up a few bits before returning home  after around five mins of being in your store two of your colleagues decided it would be a nice idea to go from standing in the middle of an isle having pointless conversation to openly making remarks and gasps about they way i was dressed (if your wondering i am a goth) before i had even walked away from them. I was literally staring at them while they fell silent and then went onto gasp and gossip on the shop floor about what i looked like. I genuinely thought i was going crazy and decided to catch up with my friend and tell her what had just happened and she thought at first that i was over reacting  so a few minutes later we walked past again and she witnessed them do the same if not more offensive remarks and gasps. I was so shocked that this event even transpired ii could barely continue shopping i felt like crying it was absolutely awful. I worked as a member of staff for Tesco for two years myself and know for a fact that this sort of behavior is no tolerated. I chose to take my complaint to a manager who assured me he was sorry and that he would issue an apology from the staff and reprimand their behavior. I left him with an email to contact me and let me know what has happened and have heard nothing back. Only a week ago i was busy reading an article about how staff members had publicly shamed and basically humiliated a girl who used to self harm by refusing service and blaming it on an invisible policy  The worst part is i am not the only person this is happening too i know many people who are left so ashamed they cannot even try to take it further. Why do you feel that it is acceptable behavior for your staff to behave in a manner like this? Two months ago i was being treated for severe clinical depression and had the timing been any different i have no idea what could have happened. I have already been put into a position where we are now having to disscuss my return to medication due to this incident and i cannot even get an apology issued. It s appalling and disgusting to say the least and i will never be placing a foot through the doors of one of your stores again.					2016-03-24T00:11:30+0000	1458778290	2016-03-24 01:11:30	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No effort to sort...so sadly left and went to another shop as  Refreezing thawed ice cream not only changes its texture  resulting in a grainy and crystallized texture  it can also serve up some potential bacterial contamination issues. As mentioned above  when ice cream is left out and begins to thaw  there is an increase in potential harmful food borne illness if consumed .					2016-03-23T20:51:52+0000	1458766312	2016-03-23 21:51:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There is something about my local Tesco srtore that I absolutely love. Its the fact that often when I visit there I see and hear this incredibly talented busker called Josh. He really is so so good - and he s so friendly and polite. I have heard to day that you are banning him from playing. God knows why you don t want him there as I swear he brings people to the store. However what you have said is that he may stop people making donations to local charities. We all know this is nonsense don t we  so can we start behaving like adults maybe? You give Joshua his pitch back or we ll make bloody sure that while people carry on supporting local charities  they stop shopping with you. How does that sound?  Joshua Sole has been busking in and around the Telford area since January 2013. During his time busking he spent many hours playing music in Madeley  where he spent his childhood growing up around the markets with his dad Steve  who is a market trader of 25 years.  Joshua has become a part of the Madeley community and many people  old and young  look forward to hearing Josh and chatting to him  as he is a true local  with roots in the area and many fantastic friends who support his music. Tesco on a few occasions have asked Josh to move along and he has stood his ground and refused  now this week on the 17/3/2016 Joshua was busking in Madeley  when he was approached by a security guard and a Fresh Food Manager and asked to move on. They said Tesco donate to charity and Josh s busking may deter people from donating  so Josh offered that he donates 10% of his busking earning to their instore charities. They declined. He then stated after this weekend  he will be out of the area for some time and asked for this weekend  that the management allow him to busk Friday afternoon 17/3 and Sunday daytime 21/3 for a period not exceeding two hours on each day. They declined.  Since Tesco arrived in Madeley many small local business  have ceased trading and the local market has shrunk to an unrecognisable size due to fierce competition and Tesco s purchasing Madeley. Please sign this petition to show Tesco that we support our local busker s and we wont see massive corporations like Tesco punch down to the small guys  and that we the undersigned support our small local business . Lets try and help Josh get his pitch back for when he is next in Madeley  and also allow other buskers to our small  welcoming and friendly Parish.					2016-03-23T16:23:37+0000	1458750217	2016-03-23 17:23:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bit disappointing that you discontinued the Free From yorkshire puddings the other week. Seems those of us on a limited diet don t get considered the same way as the masses - would have been nice if you had at least kept them in store until after Easter.					2016-03-23T13:17:55+0000	1458739075	2016-03-23 14:17:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I  was looking for products for my rats in your pet section.  You have dried corn which is at a great price so I  was going to buy some. I was disgusted to see a live moth in one of the packets. I  informed a member of staff who went to a more senior member.  I was still down the pet aisle when the senior member of staff brought the packet back to the shelf and put it back with the other products  (but tried to put it behind the other products).  I asked her what she was doing. She said she was putting it back until the manager came. I told her she couldn t do that as if someone else bought it it could make their pet very sick.  She still wanted to put it back on the shelf. I  told her not to and that all the products should be taken off and checked. I  had to explain again that there  could still be other bugs in the packets that could make pets sick.  She eventually took the moth packet away and said she would explain it to the manager (which there had been no indication that anyone had called).  I left it at that but because she was so determined to put it back I checked the shelf again before I left to make sure it hadn t been replaced.   I think your members of staff need more training especially with something that could potentially cause damage to people s pets. If your staff aren t trained in how to deal with a product like that then you shouldn t be stocking it.  It is safe to say I  will not be buying any pet products from you again and I will also be letting all the pet groups that I am a member of on here know about this	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/735074_10207926891223668_8500019387587519734_n.jpg?oh=5f5847172a5849161181849c74a8ffea&oe=590697F4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/735074_10207926891223668_8500019387587519734_n.jpg?oh=5f2e07195e295104c14f4125daecd9d8&oe=591C300B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207926891223668&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-23T12:28:08+0000	1458736088	2016-03-23 13:28:08	0	3	0	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco at  Bonnyrigg rd  dalkeith is a joke! Having to get a baby seat and a 7 year old out of normal spaces is a nightmare  on Sunday I seen 3 people come out of their cars with no kids (young and old) Even in the other spaces that clearly state pick up only people park and gone do their shopping  why does your stores let it slide??

I just visited for milk and had to leave quickly due to the obnoxious smell. The cashier staff were complaining of headache s due to the smell and I was told that they only just finished painting. However I can guarantee that the TOXIC SUBSTANCE was NOT paint! Visited at 10.59 Wed 23rd.

Why have these not been spotted sooner  your not telling me that it  just happened  they should have been seen before i did. Stock rotation?!?!  Took them to customer service and was thanked for bringing it to their attention  she took them up to the bakery dept for me to hear the member of staff say did the customer say if anymore were like it!  Sorry but thats not my job  although im sure i could do better. You need to be checking better  cudtomers certainly dont want to be greeted with this sight. So people check your bread because the tesco staff dont.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/s130x130/12380438_10205642936580236_2114598093_n.jpg?oh=d8c091aa107515318d1c2980ba965598&oe=588118D5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/s720x720/12380438_10205642936580236_2114598093_n.jpg?oh=91e3504484a67b56665c8de1b4eae484&oe=5880190A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205643092464133&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-23T10:55:31+0000	1458730531	2016-03-23 11:55:31	2	5	7	2	14	5	5	0	0	0	2	0	4	0	0	1	0

I am seriously considering shoping elsewhere.  The latest casualty is a bag of carrots....  no longer available  but I can have posh carrots or organic ones at twice the price  or purchase individual carrots by item or weight.... but cannot buy more than 25 carrots????  With this and the missing 900ml Innocent apple  and Orange juice  the missing Aunt Bessie products  the missing sharwoods vindaloo sauce  the missing pataks curry sauces  the missing varieties of brand name bread  the missing cleaning products (febreze variants) the missing seabroook multi packs and so on and so forth....  I would actually be better off shopping elsewhere.....  at least I could get the items I want  and ones I used to get from Tesco.					2016-03-23T09:36:39+0000	1458725799	2016-03-23 10:36:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know exactly what is needed and plan my shop in advance. But.....yesterday I was thrown off balance  as I neared the end of my mammoth shop  strolling (with a purpose) down the aisle with cling film  bin bags etc  I arrive at the sandwich bags. Now  as I have to provide lunches for 6 children and a husband  I have found the Tesco Value sandwich bags are a perfect size and have the added bonus of somewhere to write their names. I m looking  top shelf to bottom  nope can t see them anywhere. But I check again just to make sure. I even asked a member of staff  to be told the devastating news that they have been discontinued 😱.   I just wanted to let you lovely people at Tesco know that this has meant my children  and husband  now have to make do with foil covered sandwiches as I am unsure of the quality of your other sandwich bags.   Yours sincerely   A stressed mother and wife					2016-03-23T08:33:44+0000	1458722024	2016-03-23 09:33:44	4	18	4	2	24	16	14	2	13	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why have you discontinued the gluten free beers across your stores??? Do you not cater for people with celiac disease???? It is shocking that you have. As its hard enough for people with the disease to have a drink and source where to buy from!!!! I think it is disgusting that you have done this. As I need to travel 20 miles to buy daura for my husband. Can you please explain to me why you have done this???  I also think it is disgusting that you charge so much for the free from products ie bread for a small loaf that lasts two days £3 is steep. Can you not lower your prices its expensive as it is for food in this day and age.

Phil was next to join the great field in the sky. He was very sick and his innards dripped out from his rear end. It wasn t a very pleasant way to go and we ve spent half an hour cleaning up what can only be described as a blood bath. It was in the fridge  it was on the floor  it was all over my husband s legs. Phil once was a full bottle of milk and now he s sadly only half a man. I would ve attached an IV drip but I didn t have one to hand and the costs of milk vets at this time of night is extortionate. RIP Phil.  I will remember you when I sip my morning coffee.

Not very happy with you changing my usual yoghurt. The sweet treat option which used to have the chocolate and vanilla pots on it has now been replaced by banana which is horrible. Also the plain vanilla type seems to have a different recipe as well. Not liking the change so will not be buying in future.					2016-03-22T21:32:09+0000	1458682329	2016-03-22 22:32:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also  there is so little Free From products aimed at young children. You re maybe missing a gap in the market. I know it s only packaging  but I know children would not like to feel they re different. And it must be a pain for parents of children with intolerances to have to check the labels of everyday foods to see if their children can eat something similar to their friends without paying the inflated  free from  prices.   However  well done on the new Free From Caterpillar cake  I m looking forward to buying it for my son s birthday party who has a gluten intolerant guest.					2016-03-22T21:10:25+0000	1458681025	2016-03-22 22:10:25	1	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0

We drove nearly 20 miles to collect our shopping which we ordered through click and collect. Only to be greeted at the loading bay with a sign  saying  go to customer services in Store   We was then informed by Lisa at customer services that there had been a power cut today and our shopping was not picked  your Head Office was told by the Store to contact all customers for this afternoon / evening collections and inform them that our orders would not be ready today.  Did my husband  or myself get this call from your Customer Services at Head Office?  No we did not  but we did get an email giving us £10 off our next online shop and thanking us for notifying Tesco of a complaint. we did not complain to Tesco as we had nothing to complain about and it wasn t until we got to your Exeter store that we realised what the online voucher was for. The email also said it values its customer feed back. Well here is feed back........ Sort your head office customer services out it sucks.!!!!!!  The Staff at your Exeter store was excellent Lisa on the desk and your Dot.com manager was very appologetic. They did everything they could to help us get a few essentials as we couldnt do a full shop as we had our dogs in the car to get us through the next 24hrs. Maybe you should transfer them to head office  and run customer services as clearly they have the customers intentions at heart. When we rang Tesco.Com from the customer services desk to rearrange to have our groceries repicked for the next day to collect we was told that nothing could be done for the next 2 days. After speaking to a customer services advisor on the phone we did get  told we would receive £20 to cover our fuel as a good will gesture. If we get this voucher I will hold my breath.  Thanks for a completely wasted trip  and we still have empty cupboards. Hope you value this feedback.					2016-03-22T21:03:46+0000	1458680626	2016-03-22 22:03:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sometimes I like a wrap  sometimes I like a pasta salad and sometimes I like a sandwich.  I m a strong believer in the sandwich. It s a solid lunch and there s a type for everyone. BLT  Egg and Cress  all day breakfast  I love them all.  However  I believe you are missing a key gap in the market. No UK supermarket currently stocks a ready made Marmite sandwich.  I m a keen lover of marmite. I lick the stuff out the jar. All I want in life is the ability to walk into a Tesco store and purchase the perfect sandwich filled with my favourite yeast extract.  I m a simple man. I m happy with plain marmite. Feel free to be creative though. Maybe cheese and marmite? Cheese  ham and marmite? I won t bore you with a list of suggestions as I m sure you have a fully capable research and development team.  So come on Tesco  give me the good stuff in a sandwich! Recognise this truly great product and reward marmite fans everywhere!  Yours  Ross Bibby  P.S. Don t fob me off with Vegemite. That stuff is disgusting and yes  I will be able to taste the difference.					2016-03-22T20:44:32+0000	1458679472	2016-03-22 21:44:32	25	7	29	0	36	7	6	1	0	0	25	0	0	4	0	0	0

Do you actually do them? I m sure I am not the only parent in Kidderminster with the need to have a trolley with two seats to be able put my two girls in and be able to do a weekly shop. As it was I had one child in the seat and one in the actual trolley which I am sure you will agree that this is not ideal situation!  Please look into this as a matter of urgency for all parents with more than one child!					2016-03-22T19:26:39+0000	1458674799	2016-03-22 20:26:39	3	5	3	0	8	5	4	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now...  The left pack is from your Rochdale store. This branch NEVER put any sugar on them. The right pack is from your Plymouth transit way store. They ALWAYS have sugar on them. So do other stores. So who s right? Could you pass a message to the Rochdale store to put some sugar on them because all the other stores taste so much better with the sugar. :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/11987_10156773893220249_3880762443443005703_n.jpg?oh=703c0077b165212e304a787d6c6ee522&oe=5909C95C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/11987_10156773893220249_3880762443443005703_n.jpg?oh=4fe0ef41f4df471ea14cdd6420542184&oe=591DB40F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156773893220249&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-22T18:21:20+0000	1458670880	2016-03-22 19:21:20	10	22	10	0	32	22	7	15	15	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know it s only a fish  but it was really outstanding interaction and customer service.

Thank you for the code you sent me for FREE Hot Cross Buns. I thought at first it was a very nice gesture.  However now I am HOT & CROSS because you do not allow the voucher on FREE FROM Hot Cross Buns.  I like many  many others cannot eat white bread.  Tescos no longer sell Wholemeal Hot Cross Buns so i have to go miles out of my way to go to Waitrose for wholemeal products.  Your FreeFrom range was a possible salvation but they are TWICE the price.  Disgraceful.					2016-03-22T18:13:34+0000	1458670414	2016-03-22 19:13:34	0	1	0	1	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Instead we have been given just garlic dough balls for 42 calories more and 2.8g of protein less per 3 dough ball serving (trust me  this counts when you are post-op gastric bypass and live on 800-1000 calories a day whilst getting 60-80g of protein in too). You have also added thickeners (which  although the new recipe doesn t contain milk  wheat or egg  many people are sensitive to xanthan gum and guar gum) and doubled the amount of sugar! I can t quite believe that last bit  considering that so many people are now cutting it from their diets - or at least reducing their daily intake considerably - due to the health risks associated with consuming large amounts of it. I can appreciate that you wanted to offer something to those who can t tolerate milk but why take away the old version to replace it with this? Could you not stock both?  Here is a comparison:  1 cheesy garlic dough ball: 36 calories  1.1g protein  Ingredients: Tapioca Starch (Sulphites)  Semi Skimmed Milk  Pasteurised Egg  Emmental Medium Fat Hard Cheese (Milk) (9%)  Mozzarella Cheese (Milk) (9%)  Medium Fat Hard Cheese (Milk) (9%)  Extra Virgin Olive Oil  Garlic Powder (Sulphites)  Salt  White Pepper  1 of the new garlic dough balls: 50 calories  0.1g protein  Ingredients: Potato Starch  Garlic Spread (30%)  Rice Starch  Water  Thickeners (Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose  Xanthan Gum  Guar Gum)  Sugar  Yeast  Salt  Psyllium Husk Powder  Rapeseed Oil  Yeast Extract  Lentils  Acidity Regulator (Sodium Acetate)  Enzymes  Garlic Spread contains: Margarine  Garlic Purée  Water  Garlic Powder  Parsley  Rapeseed Oil  Salt  Onion Powder  Margarine contains: Palm Oil  Water  Rapeseed Oil  Coconut Oil  Emulsifier (Mono- and Di-Glycerides of Fatty Acids)  Flavouring  Vitamin A  Vitamin D  Colour (Beta-Carotene)  I am so disappointed. I m afraid I won t be buying the new ones. The ingredients list for the Cheesy Garlic Dough Balls looks like something I could whip up in my own kitchen... the new recipe doesn t appeal to me at all because of the added ingredients.					2016-03-22T16:56:26+0000	1458665786	2016-03-22 17:56:26	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have found the level of customer care sadly lacking. I must say that I have not been to the store for some time following witnessing a supervisor barrating a young lad in front of his colleagues and customers. She was absolutely vile to him and made him cry. Good stuff eh? I challenged the supervisor but I felt it fell on deaf ears. So after a period of absence I returned to the store today and spent over £50 (more fool me!). Whilst in the store I saw on the “reduced” shelves a number of items many of which did not have the yellow reduced label. However  that didn’t matter as of course everything on the sheves would be reduced and this is clearly stated on the sign above. I picked up some chocolate choux buns which I though my children would like but no label. I spoke to a member of staff who stood by me and asked if she could mark them down. They did by the way have a best before date of today 22/03. She told me that it had nothing to do with her and that I should go to the bakery section who would mark it down. So after thanking her I went off to the bakery section and expalained what had occurred and asked if the lady there could mark down the pastries so I could go to the checkout. This was around 9.30 am. I was met with - “ I cant do that. Can’t mark anything down until 10 am”. Pressing her on the basis that it was 9.30 I was met with a firm “no”. I then asked why  if they had not been reduced  were they on the reduced shelf under the sign that  said everything on the shelf was reduced. She replied that it was nothing to do with her then turned to her colleagues to ask if they knew to which all responded  “no  don’t know anything about it”. I was then directed to go to a checkout and could have it reduced there. On arrival at the checkout I explained once again the debacle and asked if she could reduce the item as suggested by the bakery staff. “I cant do that” was the response and suggested the bakery staff would have to do it!! I then pointed out again it was they who sent me to the checkout. A supervisor was called to the checkpout and I had to exp[lain the whole thing again. I was by this time getting very frustrated having been pushed from pillar to post by staff who quite frankly didn’t want to take responsibility. So what could the supervisor do? Obviously she had been trained to the highest standard in customer relations and seeing how I had been treated  would resolve the problem by marking down the item and offering an apology. Well that’s how the story should have gone but this is Tesco so no such luck. I was told nothing could be done as it wasn’t the magic time of 10 am. I repeated that I had been directed around the store and each person I spoke to passed the buck. I queried again the point of placing things on reduced shelves when they were not reduced. Customers could and no doubt do  unwittingly pay full price for things they believe to be reduced.  The supervisor suggested the items must have been placed there by a customer. I expressed the view that this could not be the case unless that customer had deposited several other items which did not have a yellow label. The item’s best before date was today and as it was clear to be marked down at 10 am  it is more likely to have been put there by the bakery staff.  So what would I say my experience was like? Alsolutely dreadful - no customer care (more like don’t care). Every little helps?? I don’t think so!!! When will you learn  Teco  that it is the customers who keeps your shops open??					2016-03-22T15:23:40+0000	1458660220	2016-03-22 16:23:40	2	13	2	0	15	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just had my online shop delivered  ordered 3 x 90g packs of mini eggs in bags and you have substituted 2 x 103g tubes.  You don t know if I wanted 3 lots of mini eggs or 270g of mini eggs.  Either way you have failed because I only have 2 lots and 206g.  It really is common sense and frustrates me that your pickers haven t got this skill (or should I say common sense).  You usually do it with a joint of meat on a Sunday meaning I have to go to the store to resolve  this is to do with Easter Cakes I am meant to be cooking this evening.

A piece of glass from a bag of parsnips went into my partners fingers when she was putting the shopping into the car. it was more bloody when she went in and they cleaned it up and paid for our shopping. We hope they will be checking all the parsnips as we were a little shocked by this. No matter how small the glass it could cause someone (especially a child!) a more severe injury. Shocked and happy if that s a feeling...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12038361_10100322418220871_5500497247246951910_n.jpg?oh=cc9a64f1d5c2d8bcdda39c0b5e6a0442&oe=58D8C2B6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12038361_10100322418220871_5500497247246951910_n.jpg?oh=2e65392c2f375a1958b5632a08be976e&oe=590A3FBB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100322418220871&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-22T11:32:23+0000	1458646343	2016-03-22 12:32:23	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Needless to say this happened about 8 times whilst I was filling up! When I reported it to the garage they did a pump test and found it almost delivered the true amount-HOWEVER they failed to realise their pump test had no clicks in it where the diesel was stopped and then syphoned back into yr pump however my meter continued to climb my normally £15 of petrol today cost me £20 and I d like to be refunded the difference please!

He struggles with strong flavours (even if that flavour seems mild to us). Tesco was the only place that made strawberry toothpaste. It made teeth brushing time easy. But to my dismay you stopped making it a year ago! I managed to find one store that sold it at the time and bought a few tubes but this stash has run out! I ve tried all sorts of flavours with him since and all make him heave and refuse to brush. Bringing the strawberry toothpaste back would save so many unnecessary meltdowns. Is this something you would be able to consider? After speaking to other mums in the same situation  I know that there would be a lot less battles up and down the country come tooth brush time if this was a possibility!!					2016-03-22T09:53:19+0000	1458640399	2016-03-22 10:53:19	0	10	0	0	10	7	2	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went in purely to buy some butter at 11:10 pm this evening. Went to a self service checkout  scanned my items and the checkout needed some sort or authorisation before it let me pay. I stood there waited for around 5 minutes before going to find someone. Why wasn t there someone there to assist? All those tills and absolutely NOBODY there to help (where s the every little helps there????)....knowing how temperamental the self serve checkouts are.  Any how I found a member of your team who went to find someone who could help. The so call  night duty manager  appeared and then went for someone who had some sort or card? Then came back and was unable to do anything as needed something else.... Anyhow as I saw he was the  so called duty manager  I questioned him as to why there was nobody at the checkout area to assist customers (as others had just left their shopping and walked out....) and the  manager  got all condescending and patronising! And said he needed to get another card to sort the till out. Firstly I don t expect to be spoken down to! And why couldn t he answer a simple question that I asked! A simple I m sorry we are short staffed I will get this sorted for you.... But no! I ended up walking out without my shopping like other customer! Why isn t your most  senior  member of floor staff unable to work a till need to get something else to sort this out? Surely they have authorisation and the ability and tools to sort out any minors issues! Maybe I should take my money else where  I am treated with a little more respect!					2016-03-22T01:04:16+0000	1458608656	2016-03-22 02:04:16	6	7	6	0	13	7	4	3	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Staff are repeatedly unhelpful and always in the way with their carts. Last few weeks nothing in your fruit and veg department has more than a day on it til goes out of date and you regularly find mouldy stock on shelves. I bought some new potatoes yesterday and have just got to cut and cook and half the bag are black inside. I only still use this store as it s the only decent size supermarket within a few minutes drive but am considering going to environmental health now as the standards are ridiculous. You are going to make someone vulnerable I ll if you are allowed to carry on in this manor! A month ago I actually pointed out the mould on potatoes and peppers and the young girl laughed and said oops. She walked off without taking off the shelf. You staff need retraining or you need a manager hat has some control	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10308435_10207878287548301_7964438621266849564_n.jpg?oh=5c89db735dc9f4b1b38d2a4327e91bf8&oe=590BC127	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10308435_10207878287548301_7964438621266849564_n.jpg?oh=c79132faa7d97d89e0d35962313df48d&oe=5909982A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207878287548301&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-21T20:39:14+0000	1458592754	2016-03-21 21:39:14	5	6	5	0	11	5	3	2	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just a teeny moan tonight 😃 So i paid £2.00 for a four hour delivery slot from you (between 4-8pm) and guess what? My shopping came just after 8! Tad annoying! I usually can tolerate this when i only pay for a 1 hour slot  but with four whole hours of potential delivery time from you  i feel you coulda done better!  Also  as a side moan  i ordered some cr2032 batteries  and as a substitute you bought me AA batteries. Was that supposed to be a joke from you guys?  They dont fit by the way. (Obviously i sent them back with the driver).   Anyway. Tarah from me  sort it out yeah?   X					2016-03-21T20:33:50+0000	1458592430	2016-03-21 21:33:50	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is not the first  second or even the third time that you have let me down  but it is the first time I ve written to you.  I get my weekly shopping online from Tesco and it is delivered from Huntly.  I add a comment on the milk section to please make sure it has a good expiry date.  This doesn t happen.  Yesterday was the final straw when I was delivered Yeo Valley Organic Milk (which I always order but accept another organic substitute) which had an expiry date of 18th March.  It was the 20th March.  Not only is this terrible customer service and indicates your complete contempt for my requests  but it is also illegal.  Unfortunately I am stuck with Tesco as I ve paid upfront for deliveries.  However  I can assure you that when this expires I will be ordering from Sainsbury s online at Nairn.					2016-03-21T19:18:20+0000	1458587900	2016-03-21 20:18:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On closer inspection i found what I thought to be a staple in between the inner and outer layers.  After pull the so call staple out it appears not to be a staple but a sewing pin that was wedged between the layers.

I m not sure if you ve been made aware  but the sugar tax doesn t come into force for 2 years. I also find it very offensive that this is a SUGAR tax  so why have you also upped the price of diet products (which contain about 0.1g of sugar per 100ml - WAY under the tax threshold) and even the cost of  sugar free  products which have no sugar in them at all. Nothing but daylight robbery and I m so glad I only get a few bits and bobs from you these days!					2016-03-21T14:49:59+0000	1458571799	2016-03-21 15:49:59	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My shopping was due to be delivered today but unfortunately the van had broken down so you were unable to make a delivery. I was offered a different time or to collect myself  and given a £10 voucher for my troubles. I m collecting myself this evening after work but can I just say thank-you  I was kept informed the entire time and spoke to two really lovely members of staff about it who couldn t apologise enough.

Recieved a phone call 20 minutes before my delivery was due saying my card wasn t accepted and I needed to give my details again over the phone or you wouldn t be able to deliver. Same card I have always used for my shop for many years and which I have used several times since Without problem. Needless to say I didnt give my details over the phone because it could have been anyone calling. In these days of fraud awareness surely this shouldn t happen?! I asked if an email had been sent to confirm what had happened and that I would be receiving a call to request the card details again - no  and no further communication since.

You are getting worse and worse delivering short life dates  fobbing them off on delivery customers. I have spent a fortune with you. I pay to have it delivered as with 3 young kids it make life easier. I don t have time to call your customer service each time complaining but today I did. The children s Petits Filous yougurts were delivered with just two days left without being informed and when I checked the other packet it had at date of the 13th of March!!! - today is the 21st!!! I almost fed that to my young child without checking! So you refunded 1 yougurt packet and astonished at that is all you offered  you then offered a £5 voucher. Wonderful!! Simply not enough  the delivery charge alone was £4. It s not about the money though. This is not only an inconvenience but a health hazard especial on a children s food and a total disgrace. It highlights dates are just not being checked either in store or by the picker which is not acceptable from a large company like tesco!! I look forward to your comments.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10329322_10154123836168086_2542114670585837308_n.jpg?oh=5a346bb8099a9927399444ce149c8838&oe=59156A63	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/10329322_10154123836168086_2542114670585837308_n.jpg?oh=bc0f73c965622785599f64bfae78b64f&oe=59154270	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154123836168086&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-21T12:40:51+0000	1458564051	2016-03-21 13:40:51	5	11	14	4	29	11	8	3	3	0	5	0	2	0	0	7	0

I don t usually weigh my tuna but we re both doing this silly diet where we re required to eat certain amount of food.  As you can clearly see  the tins say NET WEIGHT 160g and DRAINED WEIGHT 120g  but on the scales  the DRAINED WEIGHTS are 106g and 94g!  Now these tins come in a 4 pack and I ve only opened two tins and already I ve lost out on 40g of tuna! If this is the case with each tin  then I am missing out on an average of 20g a tin! So in hindsight I am going to miss out on 80g of tuna from this 4 pack  that s 2/3 of a tin MISSING!

My daughter fell out of the baby seat on a trolley which admittedly was entirely my fault  I thought she was strapped in but she wasn t. She landed on her head and as you can imagine she screamed the place down. Not a single person offered me any help with her whatsoever including the person on the checkout I was standing at whilst trying to comfort her. I then packed my shopping whilst trying to hold her and left the shop. I had to take her to a&e within half an hour of leaving the store as she was drowsy and vomiting. As a mother and customer I am appalled actually that nobody offered me any help with packing up my shopping or that it wouldn t be required for a first aider to see her.					2016-03-21T10:35:01+0000	1458556501	2016-03-21 11:35:01	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve gone to add a couple of items today to find that some items have been removed with the message   Tesco no longer sells this item.  What s that about? If you no longer sell a product  how come the product was available on Saturday? Biggest question of all though is how come one of the products you  no longer sell  is white potatoes? The only  choice  of potato was Maris Piper  which I m not a fan of. Why do you  no longer sell  white potatoes?					2016-03-21T10:01:44+0000	1458554504	2016-03-21 11:01:44	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Very disappointing! And very sad kids.					2016-03-20T22:33:32+0000	1458513212	2016-03-20 23:33:32	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Scheduled an order to be delivered between 8-9pm. No call from the driver. Called Tesco at 9:15 pm to chase up. The advisor Cathy could get no response from the driver and would call us back within 10 minutes regardless of what news she could update us with. We had to ring in at 9:55 pm to check what was going on. Note on file apparently said she called us back but no response  the phone was right beside us and no missed calls. The second advisor said our delivery had been cancelled due to driver sickness (so presumably we could have been informed in advance and made other plans). The advisor has rescheduled the shop to tomorrow and despite this poor customer service has only offered a paltry £10 off and felt like this issue was simply swept under the rug and of very little  importance. In doing so they have removed a £5 saving  so essentially this is £5.   We will be calling in the morning to cancel the order as the contact centre is closed and as we currently have an inclusive delivery package we will be cancelling this also and doing future shops with a competitor.  Very disappointed with the service we have received.					2016-03-20T22:22:29+0000	1458512549	2016-03-20 23:22:29	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a cuddly lamb from your Easter range for my little girl but it has broken  there was a loose thread at the side of it s face which when pulled lightly resulted in the whole top panel coming off and exposing the stuffing which obviously is a choking hazard. I haven t exchanged it yet as I can t find a store in Dundee that has it in stock and I don t want to just return it as my little girl totally loves it. Can you help please?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10649957_10153350328847687_8640759701466713293_n.jpg?oh=822e50eeda47e80a9c5e80be1c015339&oe=591802E3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10649957_10153350328847687_8640759701466713293_n.jpg?oh=782f21670175c1c48892d57e60b40127&oe=5914FF05	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153350328847687&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-20T21:42:58+0000	1458510178	2016-03-20 22:42:58	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

There were plenty more doing it too. Luckily hubby was with us so the shopping still got done lol. She was very keen to get back to the staff with the answers and the face painting was lovely.					2016-03-20T21:41:55+0000	1458510115	2016-03-20 22:41:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What kind of shopping delivery service is that.  When I asked when they knew this was a problem I was told 5 pm why has it take over 4 hours for someone to call me and inform me of this. Apparently I was right at the bottom of the list - seriously! nice to know where I stand There wasn t even an offer to deliver a day later.  I have no bread or ham for my sons sandwiches for school tomorrow and now my husband has had to go out and try and find somewhere thats open to get some.  All i can say is that this is a disgrace. Its one thing having an issue  another  not informing your customers quickly or thinking about how they are communicated to   it shows a complete lack of customer service and to add insult to injury Im  told  oh we will give you £10 off your next shop.  The last time Tesco let me down this badly was christmas eve a couple of years ago when your delivery van showed up and told me they didn t have my christmas turkey at 11 pm  despite me putting the order in  a month previously.  You may be a big company but you don t know anything about customer service and if I acted in this way my company would soon be out of business. This is an absolute joke.  After the turkey debacle it took me a long time to trust tesco again and now I will be taking my business elsewhere yet again and for good.  Tesco get your act together  Mrs Friend					2016-03-20T21:24:16+0000	1458509056	2016-03-20 22:24:16	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Im not sure how many by this point we would have already ate?! Im not sure where exactly you source your fruit but i suggest the people packing it take more care  or maybe Tesco can check the quality before putting it out on the shelf for customer purchase? Unfortunately i don t have any pictures as i ended up being sick and my friend had to discard of the spider ridden pot of fruits!!

Yesterday I received my car insurance renewal which was over £100 more than last year. this is odd as I haven t moved  changed my job  my car or had an accident. Like most people then looked at a comparison site only to find that Tesco were quoting a price that was £134 cheaper than my renewal for exactly the car & cover. I rang Tesco to give them he opportunity to  rethink  the quote & was told that they couldn t  renew  my insurance for any less. However they could give me a new policy instead. I now have a new policy with with Tesco for £130 less than they quoted to renew & because I went through the comparison site (& not the guy on the phone)  I also have a cuddly toy on the way. I guess that Tesco will also have to pay the comparison site some commission too.					2016-03-20T19:58:22+0000	1458503902	2016-03-20 20:58:22	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased a few items of fruit and two bottles of prosecco  the prosecco cost £5.50 each. I took my items to the checkout  after they were scanned the reading said £42:50. The Tesco Employee at the checkout didn t say anything to me but when I questioned the amount he replied oh I need to refund you. He had actually typed into the till 5 bottles of prosecco  when I had only 2.  I am disgusted firstly because he wasn t courteous to ask me for a payment amount and secondly how can you mistake 5 for 2 items the same and not realise or admit to the error. There was no apology and definitely a lack of customer care from this member of staff.					2016-03-20T17:01:05+0000	1458493265	2016-03-20 18:01:05	0	11	0	0	11	11	8	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I found some in my tesco grapes to. Fair enough with fresh fruit and veg u can expect things. Just incase though maybe you need to be Vigilant and check your grape supplies. There was about five grapes effected in my packet but it put me off then so threw out the lot. Just letting you know so you can check your stocks. Bought mine on Friday from bury store.					2016-03-20T15:23:01+0000	1458487381	2016-03-20 16:23:01	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The first time when initially contacting Tesco I was told that as the vouchers had been spent I must have redeemed them myself. After a long call to Tesco I eventually convinced the representative that it hadn t been myself that had used the vouchers. On further investigation it was established that my account had been hacked and the vouchers had been sent to an email account that wasn t mine.Unfortunately I had to wait until my next statement for my points to be credited to my account. This was very disappointing as I had intended to use the vouchers for something specific in the lead up to Christmas.  Today I logged into my account to find that £73:00 worth of vouchers had been used on 19.03.16. I was astonished to see that my account had  been hacked again. I called the Clubcard helpline and spoke to Ewan who was very helpful and quickly established that the transaction in my account was already being dealt with by the fraud team . He was able to confirm that the vouchers had been redeemed for Pizza Express and sent to an email address that didn t match mine.  This has left me concerned regarding  the security and again very disappointed as I am unable to book the hotel that I intended to book using my vouchers for a special celebration. I have been informed that I will have the points returned to my account in the next few days . I hope this is the case and that I don t have to wait for my next statement as I did last time.  I urge anyone with an account to check it as there is clearly a problem. I know that £73:00 isn t a massive amount but that isn t the point. As a customer who spends £1000 s a year with Tesco I would like to think that my loyalty rewards are safe.					2016-03-20T15:05:51+0000	1458486351	2016-03-20 16:05:51	0	5	0	1	6	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When done all this took it back to the lady to be told that she wouldn t receive anything  cause so popular yesterday I think it s total unnecessary to get a child to do something like this and not get anything. It s hard as it is goin shopping with children to be put though this  to let them do it and receive nothing why have the children do it. To me shouldn t give the things out and upset children Feel badly let down by tesco.

On the 19th of March 2016 I had a usual day of shopping at Tesco  just before coming to an end of payment my attention caught the mold bread roll (you also can see  in the picture). As you may see this got scanned on the till by the employee as shown in the receipt  until I asked to speak to the Manager. When the manager arrived smartly they took me to the side just to appologise about the situation  meanwhile the employee on the till had cancelled the bread roll as we wanted to take this further they refused to give us the first receipt and provided us with the recalled receipt. Being a customer at Tesco for so many years and seeing all the advertisment on TV about the High Quality and Services provided at Tesco this really had disappointed me. We are a Family of 5 and 1 young child who usually takes these rolls to school for lunch and really enjoys them. If you look at the date this bread roll should have been gone by the 7th of March  2016- 12 days overdue! This has really bought me to think about the health and safety of my family when giving them food from Tesco for School/work. This also proves that the employees at Tesco Perivale does not work with full attention as one it was put there with other rolls for sale and secondly the person who scanned it on the till could not see such a big mold.  I request you to issue this address with immediate attention and look forward for a reply in short time.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1486_10209103093275893_6291641456223726941_n.jpg?oh=ca6c780ef916b809fb4b210daadd74ae&oe=58D5E2B8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1486_10209103093275893_6291641456223726941_n.jpg?oh=08d017bf771ce53493ee5d5f6341fa6b&oe=591DFE5D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209103093275893&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-20T14:29:59+0000	1458484199	2016-03-20 15:29:59	14	1	14	1	16	1	1	0	0	0	13	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was 11am and advertised until 4pm. With aisles of Easter produce it was not due to running out of merchandise. I think its a very poor show for sure a large Extra store.					2016-03-20T13:10:57+0000	1458479457	2016-03-20 14:10:57	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They had a wonderful young girl doing bunny face paint. I took my little girl and asked if she could have hers done.

Who came to delivery my delivery as usual 11am  He came to the door with my shopping in crates as usual with my empty crates at the front.  The first words before anything else was are those crates covered in cat urine ?! I always wash my crates off with soapy suds before being collected as they ve been outside waiting for delivery to arrive which is what I said.   I just always wash them    He said I can t take them they re covered in urine.  He wouldn t lift my crates into the house and I had to struggle to do as my home help doesn t arrive until 12 and I m not suppose to lift after my cancer operation   I am disabled but my disability is not apparent by looking. The delivery man insisted I unload my groceries but i Said I couldn t   He then stormed off and said im talking to my manager  where he told his manager (I Presume ) that my trays where covered in urine and that I wouldn t unload my groceries as  she said she s disabled   I m sure the driver will deny the raised tone of disbelief  in his voice. Unfortunately I can t prove that  He came back from his van and said I m not taking them they re covered in cat urine.  I said that s your interpretation  not mine  he said well you told me last time they have. I said last time when. He said last time I did  your deliver. (I don t have memory of this due to my disability but i always wash the trays in Case a cat has been around and if that s true then he took them away anyway)  I said but I ve told you those ones are clean. He said I can t take your word for that. Which I then pointedly asked does that mean you do no believe what I am saying so technically Calling me a liar ? He said I don t believe what your saying but I m not calling you a liar. Asked me to sign for the shopping and told me his manager will ring me !  How can I ever use Tesco again. I would like my  delivery pass few reimbursing please. I can t explain the level of anxiety this has given me.  That was a very rude man who had obviously preconceived ideas.  my crates go back cleaner then they come. ! Trying to make a difference not using bags and have done for a long time way before the bag charge.

I have been a delivery saver member for two years and never had a problem with the service. However the last two deliveries  the use by dates on the items I have ordered have been bad. I try to check everything when the driver is still with me which is hard when they are rushing and park their vans in the middle of the road instead of using a parking space to then have cars waiting for them to move. I now have 8 pints of milk I need to replace and sandwich fillers that need to be used by today. Think it s time to look into other options as I m wasting money!!					2016-03-20T11:34:22+0000	1458473662	2016-03-20 12:34:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just watched a video on the effects the objectification of women has on society as a whole. My son  who is just 10  didn t quite understand how the media plays a role in this. I grabbed the first magazine I could find to demonstrate  and this happened to be your February 2016 edition of Food Family Living. I am horrified at just how bad it actually is.  Your magazine shows countless images of women and children baking in the kitchen or shopping for food. It also shows one image of a woman in a bath (you only see her face). All these women and children are in full makeup  with not a hair out of place. There was also a drawing of a woman waving her husband goodbye as he drives away from the home.  The magazine also contained two pictures of men. One is an advertisement  in which the man wears a matador costume. While this is undoubtedly supposed to be funny  it does once again portray the man as a strong protector. The ONLY OTHER picture of a man in your entire magazine is one of a dad out on a bike ride with his sons  placed next to an image of a woman baking with her daughter.  I wonder if you realise that you are upholding serious gender stereotypes  and that these types of attitudes are what allow sexism to continue to exist. I would welcome a magazine in which these gender stereotypes are not present. In which you show people as they really are.  #IStandUp #WomenNotObjects #FeminismMatters					2016-03-20T09:58:44+0000	1458467924	2016-03-20 10:58:44	8	56	8	0	64	32	7	25	70	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am a regular shopper at your Glasgow Maryhill store and the checkout manager shezane is constantly chewing gum with her mouth open as wide as the Clyde. Absolutely disgusting especially on the rare occasion she seems to do any work and happens to serve me making that disgusting chewing noise while she scans my shop.

I had shopping delivery due today. It turns up minus my fridge items due to some kind of contamination. The driver didn t seem to have a clue what happened next. I called the helpline and it was confirmed what the driver said. The lady then contacted the store and told me the manager would call me back to let me know what was happening. That was around 10.30am. By 4 I d still not received said phonecall so I called up again  and once again they contacted the store and I was told the manager was getting all the fridge orders on a van (wasn t just my order affected) and that it would be out tonight and also that the manager would be contacting the customers affected which I was told should be around 6/7pm. 11.15pm  Still no call  still missing half my shopping  still no idea what the hell is going on with my order  you still have my money so I m unable to replace it elsewhere as I was told if I opted for a refund it would take 3-5 days. This isn t acceptable. I spend a lot of money on groceries each week not to mention the amount I spend on clothes  footwear and school uniform so the very LEAST I would of expected would being kept up to date with what s  going on not complete silence from tescos end. I ve already boycotted one supermarket due to terrible problems with online shopping and shoddy customer service and I m afraid tesco is going to be next on my list.					2016-03-19T23:17:54+0000	1458429474	2016-03-20 00:17:54	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However when I came to eat the Kiev it turned out there was cheese in them....it says nothing on the front of the packaging to say there is cheese in these  I didnt realise I had to check on the back of packs for additional information for things like this. Shouldn t it have been labels as  CREAMY CHEESE KIEV ??  So after a long day at work I ended up having to throw the main part of dinner in the bin!

They were both so friendly as well  definitely made his day  so thank you!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/941957_10100156594627678_3625871496449469356_n.jpg?oh=89dbb7784952367aed74af33f3ae79c4&oe=590AB055	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/941957_10100156594627678_3625871496449469356_n.jpg?oh=e4efb219b42b4c0f1614d2d673122075&oe=5910DAC8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100156594627678&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-19T22:13:04+0000	1458425584	2016-03-19 23:13:04	18	3	19	0	22	3	3	0	0	0	18	0	0	1	0	0	0

I heated my rice as directed  got my fish ready and was about to add my rice when I could smell mould.  With my hunger pains tingling I took a glance inside the bag to see mouldy rice  this I had received from my online Tesco food shopping order.  I do wonder how they store their food and the fact a picker had chosen this unfit bag of rice.   Well the wife emailed tesco and guess what!? All they did was refund me for the cost of the rice   what an insult  I was about to consume this rice and luckily didn t just pour it into my fish. 😡	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/600679_10153988627333764_3234962840735365434_n.jpg?oh=bc8e6fa191d6d6266c5b0bd057517bf6&oe=5919F11D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/600679_10153988627333764_3234962840735365434_n.jpg?oh=de65c61be9c87e94e0037ff01887d177&oe=5906B1E2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153988627333764&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-19T22:10:16+0000	1458425416	2016-03-19 23:10:16	1	6	2	1	9	6	4	2	5	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

Grapes went flying all over the floor and there was no manners or organisation from anyone. I found this to be DISGRACEFUL this situation (which i assume is a weekly occurrence based on the number of people loitering around) could easily result in someone getting injured. People were pushed and shoved and barged past  trollies were blocking the isle preventing me from doing my own shopping! Grapes flying everywhere is clearly a health and safety issue  and whichever memeber of staff is tasked with the mark downs must genuinly fear for there safety when they wheel that trolly out. This is not acceptable as it is your duty as a company to prevent stampedes in the middle of your stores! Clearly these items are frequently marked down at the same time each day.... i feel that this is dangerous based of the behviour i have seen tonight and it is only a matter of time before someone is injuried! It also prevents  anyone elsing getting a look in at the reductions  times are hard for alot of people and it should not be just those who act like animals who get to benefit from the reductions. Staggering the time at which reductions are made into no predictable pattern would surely reduce this animalistic behaviour and ensure the saftey of both your customers and your staff!  I will look forward to hearing off you in regards to this issue.  Many Thanks Amy					2016-03-19T20:16:59+0000	1458418619	2016-03-19 21:16:59	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I observed one of your security staff moving on a sleeping homeless man and his dog from outside Tesco metro in Clayton Street in Newcastle. I confronted the guard as the man was a distance from the shop entrance and was sleeping  therefore causing no nuisance/disturbance. To be told by the security guard that it is Tesco policy to move on homeless people. Is this true?!					2016-03-19T17:36:05+0000	1458408965	2016-03-19 18:36:05	7	16	8	13	37	16	3	13	6	0	7	0	0	0	1	0	0

It isn t helpful when a rude member of staff pointedly states that a screaming child  just needs a good skelp !!! Shocking display of customer service.

Oran s friend managed to cut her finger and have a piece of glass stuck in it  first aid man was fantastic   another lady on shop floor fantastic  the manager Neil Lacey was vile !!! Very abrupt  no apologies for having NO SIGNS UP ! He told me that it had been made safe until it was to be mended and made out that it was this girls fault for putting her hand inside the freezer ! I am disgusted and when we passed the aisle again a little boy was doing exactly the same thing and yet NO SIGNS HAD BEEN PUT IN PLACE ! I informed the manager that I wish to make a complaint and his response was I m the right person to do that as he was the manager . I am so cross  this girl was in my care and was very upset crying and he made her feel like it was her fault !!! I am fuming   disgusted and feel very guilty for taking this girl to Tesco s with me in the first place. You can see by the pics that it s not clear the glass is smashed until further inspection.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12376666_10209210957737029_2417371128536453415_n.jpg?oh=1d9bdeab0d55f9cdf6fc5ea3870231f3&oe=591C0AFD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12376666_10209210957737029_2417371128536453415_n.jpg?oh=d16941f46096b9722a251af46bbd2641&oe=5924CCF0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209210957737029&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-19T16:47:42+0000	1458406062	2016-03-19 17:47:42	4	33	8	2	43	33	12	21	22	0	3	0	0	0	0	4	0

I couldn t find one so asked a member of staff who did a search for me. I m very disappointed to learn that you don t have any dairy free eggs. With most big supermarkets now stocking them and also shops like Aldi I assumed Tesco would be a market leader and offer a variety. I left a very dissatisfied customer.					2016-03-19T15:33:39+0000	1458401619	2016-03-19 16:33:39	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your final question is this:   Your customer has selected Tesco s Poppadoms. Upon selecting one packet (if available)  do you: A) Place anywhere into a bag with other light items (e.g. Crisps  biscuits etc) B) Place at the bottom of a bag and load at least 6 heavy cans on top as well as other heavy grocery items C) Place into a bag ensuring they are close to or on top of other products  If you selected anything other than B  you have failed.					2016-03-19T15:22:00+0000	1458400920	2016-03-19 16:22:00	3	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

The shopping app is awesome.  Several things planned for Saturday so I ordered an early collection slot.  Saturday morning came and I drove down to collect my shopping on route to doing several other things.  When trying to collect my shopping I was told that there was no paperwork for it as their printers were not working or something. At this point my stress levels rose thinking how I could fit the extra work of checking bags into my busy plans or going out to get missing items!!  I would have to check it all at home and ring the help line if there were items missing or substitutes I didn t wish. I could get a refund...not helpful if I needed something for dinner tonight!!  I refused to sign for it not knowing what I had paid for. I was very annoyed at the lack of basic organisation. It took me half an hour to finish checking and unpacking at home  not to mention sorting out the excessive bag usage.  Fortunately it was all there and I didn t have to go out to buy items which I might have needed. However this made me late in doing the other things I had planned. I had to ring around and alter plans. Something which is designed to be quick and easy to take away the stress of shopping  which I hate anyway  was highly stressful!!! As a busy working mum I rely on Tesco s to help keep me sane!!! Today was not a help.  Tesco Winnal you failed me!!!					2016-03-19T14:40:06+0000	1458398406	2016-03-19 15:40:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Due to Kelly the tesco delivery driver  we were able to go and get him. Titan was a little scared  but is fine and well.

Having the stand with free fruit to give to children was a god send today. My toddler saw me buying bananas and was not impressed when I put them in the trolley. But then we walked past the stand and there was a free banana which kept him very happy 😊 well done tesco 👍🏼👍🏼					2016-03-19T13:27:01+0000	1458394021	2016-03-19 14:27:01	4	3	4	0	7	3	1	2	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Always very chatty and smiley and no matter how hectic it can be with 3 two year olds her customer service is second to none. We actually look forward to seeing her now.

Item delivered to incorrect address as system will not allow amendment to default main address. Courier of Tesco partner has left item  in secure location  which I haven t been informed where it is or when it was delivered so I have no idea where it is; no call from courier to say trying to deliver. Tesco customer service called to say they couldn t do anything as policy with Tesco partners for the courier driver to decide where secure location is  manager then came on the phone and suggested  round the back near the bins  would be an appropriate secure location. No offer of what Tesco could do or what they may amend to stop this happening again. No offer to get IT to review why address unable to be amended and only after strong urging by myself said they will ask Tesco partner to ask courier where it has been left  but not until Monday (surely first question you ask!). Clearly no one wanted to be working on a Saturday and was passed to a manager without advising so  in an attempt to just get rid of me. Told both that there was another £300 worth of products I wanted to buy but why would I after this experience. Neither person seemed to care  just wanted me to hang up or swear so they could end conversation. No apology either for situation  or empathy. Customer service at an all time low. Manager said they will call me Monday; was actually all they said twice after I asked a question. Not holding out much hope for any improvement in service.					2016-03-19T12:50:58+0000	1458391858	2016-03-19 13:50:58	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

If I wanted to buy a box of Calvin limescale tablets I would pay £5 25 in my local (Paddington Metro Branch) Tesco when I can buy them for £5 00 at the market stall outside the store. A pack of Everyday Value toilet rolls 4 in the pack is £1 21 whilst I would pay £1 at the stall. Even a tube of Mento mints at 63p each 2 for £1 20 a saving of 6p (yes) but I can buy 4 rolls for £1 in Poundland. I m sure there are many others too.					2016-03-19T12:07:05+0000	1458389225	2016-03-19 13:07:05	0	7	1	0	8	4	1	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

I took my 19 month old daughter with me and whilst we were half way through our shop she projectile Vomited all over herself and the shop floor. Having gone shopping in her fairy dress and peppa pig wellies ( as you do at 19 months of age) it was not an ideal situation. I had a very upset little girl covered in sick and hand full of sick that I had managed to catch. A vey kind customer assisted me and sought help from Adam the Bakery manager. He could not have been more helpful if he tried. He helped me clean my daughter up and even took a pair of pyjamas of the shop floor and gave these to me for free. He then went even further and help me to dress my daughter. He offered to keep my shopping to one side if I wanted to come back later and then bagged up all of my daughters clothes that were covered.  I really wanted to show my appreciation in some way so felt this message may get back to him. I did speak to the store manager but he didn t seem that bothered or interested in what I had to say.  I cannot thank Adam enough!					2016-03-19T11:58:47+0000	1458388727	2016-03-19 12:58:47	11	1	11	0	12	1	1	0	1	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

Basically on Wednesday i did my home shopping i had thought i had booked it for the 18th. I was in a very stressful situation as my mothers funeral was on the 17th  and I was in a bit of tizzy and not thinking straight.  I decided to do it Wednesday as i knew i wouldn t have had the time on the 17th.   Well Thursday the 17th was a terrible day for me  and a long day  and it wasnt until the next day Friday i realised i had ordered my groceries to arrive on the 17th  and off course I wasnt in.   I rang customer services yesterday and explained and apologised for making the error and putting people out. The lady i spoke to was very very sympathetic  and she was very kind and just reordered it for me to arrive this morning and she even checked i had a refund.   Well my order arrived this morning and alongside it from Tesco came this large bunch of flowers for me. I was so shocked and it made me cry  I dont think i have ever been so happy but cry at the same time over such a thoughtful and caring gift. I am sorry its a bit rambling my post but I have to say THANK YOU TESCO AND THANK YOU TO THE LOVELY LADY WHO DEALT WITH ME  for sending me such a lovely thing. It was so thoughtful and has made a horrible week a little bit better to cope with  knowing there are such kind people out there. xx	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1507186_228397530845376_4544773094438593524_n.jpg?oh=603c4778a89f54497ec19e2fbed07e29&oe=590BA01B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1507186_228397530845376_4544773094438593524_n.jpg?oh=b6ff0fcbf9b53585ca004d00df405135&oe=591425A8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=228397530845376&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-19T11:41:50+0000	1458387710	2016-03-19 12:41:50	202	10	212	27	249	10	10	0	16	0	201	10	0	0	0	0	0

My senses were heightened but the element of ever increasing danger loomed. A mass flock of hungry bellys and frustrated minds were encroaching on my normally pleasant breeze through the entrance. The fight was on....As my pace quickened  the mass  as if telepathically raiding my thoughts also picked up pace. Was it me? Or was the mass involved in a civil war that I would be mere collateral damage too? No matter. In my steed like blinkered manner  I waded through the mass  taking diversions and shortcuts through the milk aisle to my destination. Tripping up the opponents as I poured through them like fluid. Boom! Front of the line  I had  championed the lunch time brigade! As the mass of 50+ academy pupils waged war over the 25 bags of chicken nuggets  I sighed with relief and ordered the good lady (who was shaking with fear of the mass) to fetch me my bacon ribs.

However  when they do charge the account with the cost of the shopping  they do not deduct the £2  but refund it in a separate transaction. I placed 2 separate orders on 12/3 and 17/3. I still have not had refund of any £2. How many online clients do they have? On their site  tesco by numbers   they claim  1 billion — the number of items delivered to customers’ homes last year by tesco.com.  If we divide that by an average of 100 items per customer  we have £20M sitting in their bank account.  Am I paranoid or is this daylight robbery?					2016-03-19T10:17:15+0000	1458382635	2016-03-19 11:17:15	1	12	1	0	13	11	2	9	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Added a pack of Paw Patrol birthday candles £2.49 to find they were delivery only - £7.95! That s 3x the cost of the candles.

The staff member I think deserves some praise  was seen to be helping an older man around the store  then helping the same man at the till - fairly standard practise some might think  but then helped the customer thru silverburn to his next destination.   So  what was so nice to see about your employee helping a customer  he was having a genuine conversation with the gent!! Which clearly made the customer feel at ease whilst nothing seemed to be any hassle for your staff!! Im afraid I don t know the name of the staff member  but I m sure you ll have some way of finding out who it was  because he certainly deserve some sort of recognition!!!					2016-03-18T22:05:22+0000	1458338722	2016-03-18 23:05:22	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It seemed a bit unusual as previously  if the driver was ever going to be late  they ve always called to let me know.I give Tesco a quick call to see what s occurring. After explaining situation to chap on the phone  he gets hold of driver and is told that driver had delivered it at 7.20pm. REALLY????? Errr......no  he did not!!!! Am I the only occupant? No! Could another member of the household have taken it in  signed for it and forgotten to mention it? Err yeah  that ll be it! I live in  a 3 bed semi  not Downton Abbey! I think I d notice if the shopping arrived  that I was waiting to cook for dinner! Several call backs later and it turns out that driver was quite adamant that he had delivered it to the correct house. Well  said driver is clearly MENTAL  or was lying to cover the fact that he d cocked up and delivered the shopping to the wrong house! Inhabitants of wrong house  were at this point  probably feasting on crisps  yogurt and dog food!!! I wouldn t mind so much but the chap on the phone was definitely not convinced  that I was not lying! Why I would want to lie and receive two identical deliveries  an hour apart  I don t quite understand. I m not sure when the old saying about the customer always being right  went out of the window but clearly it no longer applies.  The moral of the story? If someone arrives on your doorstep bearing bags of shopping that you didn t order  don t bloody sign for it you thieving ignoid!!!					2016-03-18T20:06:53+0000	1458331613	2016-03-18 21:06:53	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Usually my support worker has to go back and forth to get the security guard to come and drive it in and out of the car park as she doesn t feel comfortable driving it. Today I was transferring into her car whilst she went to fetch the guard when all of a sudden a young lad (he can t have been older than 13) rode over on his bike and tapped my window. He asked if I was ok because he saw my support worker leaving me. I explained where she had gone and he said  would you like me to help and drive it back in  I ll meet your friend and save her walking all the way in?  I was so taken aback by this helpful and thoughtful young mans offer and I said that would be very kind  he asked me to watch his bike and he drove the scooter back inside! Me and my support worker were both so shocked and touched by his caring and understanding nature that we didn t think to get his name. However we did chat with him and he is doing work experience on the canal by the post office depo and near tescos in Guildford and he is driving the boats. We couldn t thank him enough for being so considerate  if anyone knows who this young man is can you please get in touch with me? I would like to thank him personally and explain to him how much it meant to me to have someone helping me not laughing and staring. In the words of my support worker  you see? Not all people are bad! 					2016-03-18T19:56:21+0000	1458330981	2016-03-18 20:56:21	8	5	8	0	13	5	2	3	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

The picture on the box looked much more appealing  so much so I discarded my Meat Feast  and replaced it with this.    The box looked so promising. The reality is somewhat different  with only 4 crumbs that vaguely resemble  crunchy tortilla chips  . It also promised cream cheese  which I could not make out on my pizza  and the chicken looks a whole lot less appealing   Highly disappointed with this blatant act of false advertising 😥	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1918135_768722579928602_6795004953519318107_n.jpg?oh=0b10f2b2417e780a31ae1c5ea13004be&oe=5922E768	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1918135_768722579928602_6795004953519318107_n.jpg?oh=e4366e013b59409bb9b7cd2dd6af893e&oe=58D9DA9F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=768722579928602&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-18T19:50:23+0000	1458330623	2016-03-18 20:50:23	1	22	1	0	23	22	6	16	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My shopping should have been delivered this evening but it s been returned to the store because the delivery driver could not find my address. Ok so that happens occasionally. But the flat numbers are on the front of the building and they didn t think to call me for direction??   So I ve been left with a situation where I have a family to feed - they are hungry. There is a chicken cooked but nothing to go with it. And I ve had to order more food because my delivery is not ariving til much later this evening.   I was offered a £5 e-voucher as compensation but I dont really think that is good enough. Our takeaway delivery dinner will cost £20. If there had been a major problem I could understand. But it doesn t seem to me that the driver made much effort to deliver my shopping...... I have a tired 3 year old to feed who will probably be asleep by the time we are able to have dinner. That is the most annoying thing of all.					2016-03-18T18:40:25+0000	1458326425	2016-03-18 19:40:25	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased a chicken wrap along with a few other purchases. While I was on the boat I went to open my wrap to discover the seal had been tampered with and clearly already opened.  When I opened the packaging further I discovered the wrap to be covered in a substance that I can only describe as appearing like congealed sperm!!!! I was so disgusted I was ill!!!					2016-03-18T18:18:33+0000	1458325113	2016-03-18 19:18:33	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But if you provide bad customer service people tend to tell 20 or 30.  I intend to out do that.  I am going to make every effort to make sure that any and every visitor to your facebook presence gets to hear my story. So that they can make an informed decision as to whether they should ever risk spending a single penny with your company.  You really fecked me around at Christmas. But to do it twice in a matter of months was my fault really. Because I was a real dumbo for buying anything from you a second time..

I think perhaps the food pickers at the Barnstaple branch may have a different perspective to me as to what constitutes fresh. These will all be going in the bin. Perhaps staff need to be trained to look at the food and think would I eat this myself? I don t think just refunding the cost of the fruit is an acceptable response. I had to pay £4 or £5 delivery and now also have to make a special trip with a round trip time of 40 minutes to get more bananas as I don t have enough fruit to get my family through the week.

These have not been placed there inadvertently by members of the public. They have been put there by members of staff. I  as always  called the manager. As always  it s someone new. He toed the party line and tried to tell me again there is absolutely no risk of contamination. When I challenged that  he amended his words to say the only risk is of  drip . He said   Even then  it can only drip downwards  not sideways.  He s never seen blood ouse across a surface  has he?  In this photo  you will clearly see 3 raw legs of pork  one of which is touching several Gü puddings and a pack of raw mince with a pack of Cheddar Mash on top. All of these are sitting above loosely bagged portions of cooked  meat and a box of pineapple chunks.  Simply because they are on the discount shelves these goods are close to their sell by date/eat by date. This should automatically make people consider that there is a chance the packaging has been handled and maybe breached.  When there is an outbreak of food poisoning in this area  I shall ensure that the local Public Health office is informed of your policy choice of risking contamination by not segregating raw and cooked food in this way.  I hope I can rely on someone to ensure yet more staff training is carried out. Somehow  though  I don t suppose it will make the slightest bit of difference so I m shopping elsewhere from now on to be on the safe side.  PS The manager told me I wasn t allowed to take photos in store but how else was I to show you the chaos?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10632639_10156865738595727_1299407526889538450_n.jpg?oh=28dd5c7f67de32f3c74805dfd61e873b&oe=58DD2373	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/10632639_10156865738595727_1299407526889538450_n.jpg?oh=2ebdd48f742bbda929268c99f5cffc76&oe=590A3907	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156865738595727&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-18T15:31:41+0000	1458315101	2016-03-18 16:31:41	2	3	3	0	6	3	3	0	4	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0

There are clear signs stating that the spaces are for people to park in who have children under the age of five with them. Every time I go to Tesco I see ignorant people who do not have young children with them parking in these spaces and they continue to do so because they do not care and they know that they can. Your signs say that you have marshals patrolling the area  yet in all the years I have been shopping at Tesco  I have never seen anyone in forcing it. Parents and carers with small children really do need these spaces so that we can open our car doors wide enough to get our children out of their car seats. It s not fair that people take advantage of them. If you re not going to have marshals on patrol then you need to come up with a better system so that these spaces cannot be just parked in by anyone. If you are reading this and you are someone that parks in these spaces without children  please stop to consider why it is so necessary that you leave these spaces for people that need them!  Please share this post if you agree!					2016-03-18T14:29:13+0000	1458311353	2016-03-18 15:29:13	17	16	17	7	40	16	9	7	19	0	17	0	0	0	0	0	0

Smaller stores should be there for everyone offering a smaller selection of what you have in the larger stores. Why are poeple being charged more for the same product? The majority of poeple ( I would imagine) who use the smaller stores would be disabled  elderly or the less fortunate who can t travel to the larger stores without having a car. I think it is wrong that the prices are set higher  just for (and to quote one of your staff members)   for convenience  . It goes against everything Tesco stand for  every little helps .

I was shopping at your Aberdeen woodend store 16/3/2016 got all my shopping and went home to cook my tea. As I was preparing my peppers this is what I found. I went straight back and the manager came over said that s not right then his phone rang! He then said to the lady behind the desk give her a £5 voucher said a code and walked off. Normally I would be happy with this but seeing as this is not the first incident involving fresh food I want to make people aware and maybe get your staff to be a bit more apologetic.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/944856_996725407073974_4966438550053656874_n.jpg?oh=c03682b60562ddae44f0514613c38e2f&oe=58DB2E2D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/944856_996725407073974_4966438550053656874_n.jpg?oh=78b7efe8afda78cb0df43939f23e8a93&oe=592185C8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=996725407073974&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-18T12:57:33+0000	1458305853	2016-03-18 13:57:33	2	9	2	5	16	8	2	6	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is only now that I come to you with something I find rather disturbing.   As I am quite a fan of the Smint mint brand  I frequently buy them from my local Tesco Superstore (Stalybridge). This however is not my problem. My problem came when I decided to stray away from my most trusted brand and buy a packet of Extra mints instead. Of course this is a well known brand so unbeknown to me  what was I to expect if not the best from such a household name? It turns out I was wrong.   Upon opening what I thought would be a delight in fact turned out to be a tasteless disc of white chemicals (of course these mints are sugar free so I expected the chemicals however there was no flavour at all.) It was not until after consuming a further ten mints I decided to investigate further. Sat at my desk on a brisk Tuesday afternoon did it dawn on me that the date on the bottom of the tin was actually a best before date  not a manufactured date. I thought I may have been misreading the facts right in front of me; possibly even a seizure. I thought I may have even been having short term memory loss and that Id lost a year of my life. Surely Tesco wouldn t sell me something that had a best before date of 16/06/15 when the date was currently 14/03/16?! However after checking my phone for the date and asking multiple people what today s date was it turns out I was right  this product I bought was 9 months out of date.  This is not where my story ends. I thought I should investigate further. If this has happened to me I can t be alone. There would be other people out there experiencing this same phenomenon. Taking matters into my own hands I took a trip to my local store (Stalybridge in case you forgot). Picking up the first packet of Extra Mints I could find I found even more troubling news. A packet of mints nearly two years out of date (18/06/14)! I almost lost my marbles! Are you trying to kill me off one packet of mints at a time? Or is there another target? I will never know. I thought better than to approach customer services within the store as from previous experience they haven t been very receptive or willing to help (I think you should pay for better customer services people). I once came in for protein I ordered online and it took the lady that served me 25 minutes to decide it hadn t arrived  only to realise that when I returned the next day it was there and she just couldn t find it... Maybe she couldn t read... Who knows.  Getting back to my point  I thought I d raise the issue of mints as it has been on my mind ever since. And I doubt it is good business to be selling such products  especially so out of date. Even though you are not technically breaking the law (as this is a grey area) I doubt from a customer service point of view this advantageous to your company.  I have attached the image of the mints I found on sale with your store (Stalybridge  don t forget). It won t let me attach more than one image. I also have images of the mints I purchased and my receipt.  I look forward to hearing which steps you propose to resolve my complaint  and I sincerely hope you sort out customer services in this store as well.  Kind Regards  Benji Griffiths	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/995312_10153949223942394_8800289491539211478_n.jpg?oh=18b7d558bb57886a01f9e0167bca9716&oe=590EE32D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/995312_10153949223942394_8800289491539211478_n.jpg?oh=645eb4310aa1c1af01622b6410a4ad2f&oe=58D606D2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153949223942394&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-18T11:58:31+0000	1458302311	2016-03-18 12:58:31	23	14	26	0	40	14	8	6	11	0	22	0	0	3	0	0	0

Having dealt with you for many years  I am now wondering if I was wrong. Or whether you have moved head offices for your clothing.

Will certainly be shopping at Marks and Spencer just across the road. They would never be so rude to customers and would also have the intelligence to know when to apply rules and when they are being extremely petty and a  jobsworth  which is fine if its not some stroppy teenager without a clue in life refusing to serve me cigarettes at age 34 with ID in such a rude and strangely smug way. Your taking the rules a little too far. It takes a bit more life experience to guess peoples ages so maybe staff those positions with someone who has a teeny bit of life experience  and vague interest in being helpful and nice to people (a base line level of customer service) would be nice too  not that I will be ever setting foot in a Tesco ever again. I will be shopping online elsewhere too.					2016-03-18T10:58:51+0000	1458298731	2016-03-18 11:58:51	4	4	4	0	8	3	2	1	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last year it was £40  and I ve had no claims.  Online comparison site quotes Tesco insurance for new customers at £38  and I had a cheaper like for like quote for £31.  Nearly £25 cheaper than your renewal. I cancelled  but you needn t have lost a customer (with another policy too that I also cancelled).  So you lost over £110 for not being fair and transparent.					2016-03-18T10:51:37+0000	1458298297	2016-03-18 11:51:37	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The delivery I received today posed many questions...do you teach them to pack tins and jars on top of crisps?? Pack hot bread on top of each other so they get squashed???  Sending perishable goods with 2x days date?? Other orders have also been packed in a questionable way...ie..A 5x pack of baby wipes on top of 4x loaves of bread  as you can imagine the bread was not in a usable state. You have also sent me the most disgusting bag of grapes which must have been picked out of the bin  and expected me to have them and pay £3. I think not. I have complained many times about these issues and others to the customer services team but nothing changes. You clearly state that  as fresh as you d pick yourself or your money back  this is obviously not happening. As with many of those who have their groceries delivered  I am unable to do it my self anymore. What s the point of ordering your groceries online and you then end up sending half of it back because of ignorance (I can only assume).  I have now learnt that for me to get at least 1X usable loaf of bread I have to order at least 4x. May I suggest that train your pickers better or employ pickers with a brain.					2016-03-18T09:54:29+0000	1458294869	2016-03-18 10:54:29	11	4	11	2	17	3	3	0	2	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

His lame excuse was that customers where not to be let on the premises after 7.45. yet the shop seemed to have over 50 customers wandering around it. please Tesco can you advertise your right closure time.

This was bought from Tesco last year and yesterday morning my daughters (3yrs and 15mths) were playing with it when it was dropped on to laminate flooring and the underside (which is supposed to have the batteries securely screwed in) came clean off! The batteries flew out landing on the wood flooring and as I was upstairs I heard this and went down to see what the noise was. Had I not heard it  either or both of my daughters could have put one of the three button batteries in their mouth and swallowed them! This has really frightened me and I want you all to be aware that even though the batteries are meant to be safely screwed in  this can happen! I know these toys are really popular and I have already taken it back to the store where a report has been filed  but I was told it could take up to 28 days for the manufacturers to get in touch with me which I think  as it involves children s safety  is just too long to wait.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/944090_10153878017351760_6354201292766281130_n.jpg?oh=91d64262788773d7caa03f11a3377e93&oe=58D98FF6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/944090_10153878017351760_6354201292766281130_n.jpg?oh=9487307dfcecd90384429c82009d80a2&oe=590CBB09	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153878017351760&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-18T08:00:18+0000	1458288018	2016-03-18 09:00:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Even if your driver arrives in his window we might busy  in which case he will have to wait for an hour or so while we decide if we want it at the front door or back door. Once we ve decided that he will have to hand his keys over and sit on a little chair in the porch  don t worry he won t be lonely as the yodel driver and postman will be there too. We will sell him a cup of nasty coffee if he wants some. We will everything out of the van for him even if it isn t for us. Once we have checked the whole delivery he we will need to sit and wait for another half hour while we create our own paperwork  we know he s got his own paperwork but we only accept our paperwork as proof of delivery. Once we ve done that we will throw all the other stuff back in the van. Give him his keys back and send him on the way. He might be late for his other drops  sorry not our problem - we had ordered stuff before there was room for it so we had to cook dinner first to make room for what was on the van.					2016-03-18T06:10:18+0000	1458281418	2016-03-18 07:10:18	7	4	7	0	11	4	4	0	2	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was verbally abused today for standing up for bikers rights in the bike bays. All I wanted to do was send pictures of cars to Tesco to point out that they need bollards to stop cars parking in the bike bays and I was scared by the sheer anger of a woman who threatened to follow me home and destroy my partners bike. Really not good Tesco.					2016-03-17T21:58:23+0000	1458251903	2016-03-17 22:58:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ordered a few weeks ago and when we chased delivery  we were told the delivery would be that Thursday (10/3/16). We stayed in all day on 10/3/16 and there was no delivery. When we chased  we were told that they  meant next Thursday  (ie today - 17/3/16).   Again  we dutifully stayed in doors all day. During this time  we removed our old sofa  which was broken in the removal process. At approx 3pm  we had not received delivery so my husband called to chase. This time when we called  we were told that they had attempted delivery  and no one had answered so they had left a card. No one had knocked and we certainly didn t receive a card.  They claim to have taken a photo of our front door which we are yet to see.  However  this still doesn t prove anything as the photo could have been taken retrospectively.  Somehow in the course of my husband complaining to your offices  our order was also accidentally cancelled!!  So now we are left with no sofa and at present you still have our money!  So we can t even order from elsewhere until this money is returned to us  which will be another 3-5 days.  We have 2 small children  a family room that resembles a  crack den   no money with which to resolve the situation  and a guest staying at the weekend who we had promised could sleep on the new sofa!    I would like to know how Tesco propose to resolve this absolutely farcical situation?!?   I hope that you understand what a difficult situation you have put me and my family in.					2016-03-17T21:30:16+0000	1458250216	2016-03-17 22:30:16	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

My shopping experience has gotten so bad bad that I was going to Sainsburys the next day to buy all the items I couldn t get in Tescos. Despite my club card loyalty  I am tempted to save time and go straight to another supermarket that will have the items I need. It was not specialist items that were unavailable but items such as butter and gluten free pizza bases etc.  I have STILL not had a response or even an acknowledgment of my complaint. I followed up with another email earlier this week and have still had no response. I have been a customer for many years with no complaints and cannot believe that lack of customer service.					2016-03-17T19:53:38+0000	1458244418	2016-03-17 20:53:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I said you could put it tidy  what if I fall over and hurt myself? The staff member said  well we have cameras and walked off. I understand that there is a job to be done during the night but this is just a lazy way to go about the job.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/150210_979454962149361_1477789034563105258_n.jpg?oh=1aa9c640510bd462ce20dd654d50c9b8&oe=59065644	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/150210_979454962149361_1477789034563105258_n.jpg?oh=2229334f2d2f83d548a58e101ecb5de3&oe=5912C7A1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=979454962149361&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-17T19:50:14+0000	1458244214	2016-03-17 20:50:14	11	8	11	0	19	8	6	2	6	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

First  my order was delivered on the wrong date and address. I was even asked to go to that address myself and claim for the items!!!! Absolutely unacceptable!!!!!!!  The second attempt was today  they assured my full order would be delivered. Another lie!!!!!!!! I had to find out myself that my TV was not part of the delivery when I didn t see the TV box.  Tesco tells me now they are delivering my TV tomorrow  they are calling to confirm. I am still waiting for their call!!!!   This will be the 4th day I will have to alter my rutine to stay at home for the whole day in case Tesco direct decides to finally complete my delivery. No one cares about my work  my activities and all the time I have been wasting  because of Tesco Direct!  I feel extremely disappointed  tired and frustrated with the service and therefore I demand a compensation.

There were posters of the release up.  The game was there he had it in his hand . But he was out of luck    couldnt sell it to him as it hadn t been put on the system!!!  It was released at midnight!!  So he then had to go to work.  He then tried at lunch time 1.30ish at Bletchley Tesco  same thing wouldn t scan not on the system!! What a waste of time!  Surely others had been in to buy the game .  Still nothing was done about it!  What a shambles.   He had Tesco vouchers to get it with as well.  So he gave up and went to Asdas  they had the game it was on their system and scanned at the till.  Result!!

That was until they decided to unleash a driver they d probably trained on Grand Theft Auto to delivery my groceries and happily run over my garden wall. I now have to go through endless phone calls with the insurance company I ve been palmed off to. But not to worry; the clever cookies on the Tesco helpline are happy to take time out from dribbling on their keyboards to do nothing to help.

I just wanted to send my thanks to Sophie at the Bradley Stoke Extra store in Bristol.  This afternoon  I had my two children with me  the younger being just 3 months old.  As I walked around the store he got more and more upset. I decided to use the self service tills for speed  as by the time I d reached the checkout he was inconsolable. He was so upset that I ended up getting him out of the trolley. At this point  Sophie approached me and told me to carry on holding my baby. She then scanned all my shopping  packed my bags and filled the trolley back up.  All I had to do was pay. She was a lifesaver today and I want to send my gratitude to her. So thank you Sophie at the self service tills: Tesco is very lucky to have you work for them.					2016-03-17T15:48:27+0000	1458229707	2016-03-17 16:48:27	177	9	181	5	195	9	8	1	29	0	175	3	0	0	0	0	0

I have Multiple Sclerosis and sometimes without warning my legs give way. When this happens I fall to the floor. My delivery man was carrying three (empty) trays in one hand  the gadget that they use in the other  and holding the door open for me when my legs chose that moment to give way. Quick as a flash and without dropping anything he caught me before I hit the deck.    Every big helps too  Thank you Mr Tesco s delivery man  for my groceries and your help.					2016-03-17T14:42:54+0000	1458225774	2016-03-17 15:42:54	6	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco Everyday Value vegetable grills need to be brought back. They were a tasty vegan option that s not ridiculously expensive like most of the stock you sell that vegans can actually eat. I notice when trying to sort my weekly shop  that Tesco are frequently doing away with cost effective options online and replacing them with items that are 2/3x the price. That or not providing an alternative at all! Due to my disabilities I m not in a position to be hunting around grocery stores analysing labels looking for something edible. Once I find things I can eat and that don t require me to have to spend hours in the kitchen to prepare and cook I like to stick with them (adding to  not reducing what s available to me). It s very difficult for me when my routine is disrupted without notice. My days are hard enough without grocery stores making it harder to shop online for food. Come out of the dark ages British supermarkets and realise the world is changing and that you need to do more than offer 1000 varieties of pulped cattle and confectionery! A great number of people are going vegan these days either to be trendy  ethical or because it actually provides them some health benefits to cut out animal based products. If you can sell cigarettes and cheap booze on your website (very irresponsible) you can certainly make room for a vegan section!					2016-03-17T14:09:36+0000	1458223776	2016-03-17 15:09:36	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

If I were to be awarded with clubcard points for every pot hole avoided whilst looking for a space  I would save a fair amount on my weekly shop. These holes have been steadily getting worse  and are too often shoddily repaired. This is only showing one area  but most spaces now have divots where the car s wheel come to rest. Sorry for sounding cheeky  but thought it was worth highlighting.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1915048_10153992207589663_7304965823896650921_n.jpg?oh=0ad78fed6122816cd24fc60a228c644b&oe=5919D507	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/1915048_10153992207589663_7304965823896650921_n.jpg?oh=2b47ad5588e9e4d39eac9b204752bfe2&oe=590E147B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153992207589663&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-17T12:53:40+0000	1458219220	2016-03-17 13:53:40	6	2	6	0	8	2	2	0	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

You suddenly stopped selling it without notice  so now I have to shop elsewhere for decent chocolate.

After contacting Tesco via customer sevice dept I received an automated reply stating I would get a response within 24 hrs  36 hrs later no response from you so I contact you again via live chat & was told to return it to my nearest local store for investigation. When I did all they lady did was refund the cost  I told her I was told this would be fully investigated & she said  yes it will be & Tesco will probably be in touch  surprise surprise no response I m shocked at how unconcerned you appear to be about this I m just grateful it ended up in my mouth & one of my childrens. This bones was extremely sharp & measured just under 1 cm wide. Never had a problem with Tesco customer service before but this is a joke!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10501650_998603633521039_1891106221120444915_n.jpg?oh=e646a4e763bf7c5f13db32fe1db3bea2&oe=591BB7F6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10501650_998603633521039_1891106221120444915_n.jpg?oh=4d2e6a8fb514180a1ff6d4ed68c9878e&oe=58DCD409	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=998603633521039&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-17T10:59:08+0000	1458212348	2016-03-17 11:59:08	5	31	7	1	39	31	7	24	45	0	5	0	1	1	0	0	0

I ve let it lie for the past couple of months but this week  after a horrendous week of a none sleeping baby i resorted to ordering at least 12 boxes of your selection to give myself a little treat and yet again i found my much needed iced buns trashed  rattled to a mess pile . Now i know your probably going to say it doesnt matter coz it all goes down the same way but ive a conplulsive disorder which wont enable me to eat these slices in a particular way  i see them online in a picture in a certain way and i expect and pay for just that yet as you can see im now sat rattling And my disorder wont allow me to eat them in the state they are   Tesco Eton mess is not what i ordered	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/600420_10208705458896572_1639580464343348547_n.jpg?oh=70b5e27155757a5e95c24326d89f43da&oe=59142BD1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/600420_10208705458896572_1639580464343348547_n.jpg?oh=28a234dae49d5561939865c74944570e&oe=590A0C10	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208705458896572&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-17T10:32:11+0000	1458210731	2016-03-17 11:32:11	2	10	4	1	15	10	7	3	8	0	2	0	0	2	0	0	0

Your nappies were the best however now they aren t  my daughter may as well be wearing pants as they leak constantly. I just thought I would highlight this as I will be returning the bags which I haven t opened back to the store and seeking a new brand probably from a different super market as pampers etc are to expensive. I used to swear by your nappies and have used them from birth so very disappointed. I don t know if you have changed supplier or what but these are rubbish.

I was informed by a young gentleman that they had one in stock with a set of games  The nathan drake collection   at £319.99. Phoned my partner who agreed he whould like it. So I asked for it to be placed to one side so I could go and collect the money for it from home (please note that I live on Halesowen  so dependant on traffic and when the bus turns up it can be a round trip of an hour) I return back to your Stourbridge banch  ready to pay  the young gent us no where to be seen  but an older gent is on hand to help and brings the ps4 out from the back area to be processed ( I presume the young gent is either on his break or finished for the day). However when I look at the box it doesnt show that it comes with the set of games that I was told it would do. When I asked the older gent he informed me that it doesn t and that if I wanted that one then to go online  also that the ps4 on its owm would cost £319.99 (same price with the game). I explained that the other gent had said it came with the game for the same price only to be told that it wasnt in stock and that was the only 1tb version they had in stock. When I asked if they could put the game in with it (after all I was told that was what I would be paying for)  I was told they couldn t and to go online  talk about misleading   if I d have wanted a 1tb ps4 on its own I could go to asda  game  currys argos and got it for around £300  but being as he was after this set of games with the ps4 then this was the best offer at £10 cheaper. Never the less I feel that sometimes your staff are either misinformed or giving out the wrong information   and this isn t the first time ive had this happen. But rather then disappointing my partner (who had  been saving for a while to buy one) I simply went elsewhere to get one. All I can ask is could you make your staff on the electronic department fully aware of what stock you have in as for me I wasted time to be told something different when I returned to your shop. :(					2016-03-17T10:26:00+0000	1458210360	2016-03-17 11:26:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They generally have 8 a day between them.  My 4 year old doesn t like many other soya yoghurts due to the lumps of fruit in them.  She was so upset this morning when she opened her yoghurt for breakfast and found lumps in it too. She was reduced to tears over it.  The packaging didn t say there had been a change so finding the bits of mango came as a shock.					2016-03-17T09:01:38+0000	1458205298	2016-03-17 10:01:38	2	4	2	0	6	4	4	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you get in touch with the 24hr Tescos in Stourbridge West Mids and inform them to serve between these hours. Its the only place I can get Old Holdborn in my area and I also work nights so this is when I do my shopping. thanks  I await your reply.					2016-03-16T22:52:33+0000	1458168753	2016-03-16 23:52:33	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  last night I did make a visit because you were the only place open.   I purchased some cheese  this  mature  Stilton was among said cheese purchase. I didn t get round to eating it last night  so I thought I d have it this evening.   Now  being someone who s not used to working class food  I was somewhat surprised to read  mature Stilton  mellow taste and lovely creamy texture strength 4 . I was under the impression that a mature Stilton would be full of flavour  and presuming that your chesseflavourometer goes up to 5  that would suggest the same  so I wonder how it can  at the same time  have a mellow taste? It seems like an oxymoron to me.   As it happens  I think where I made the mistake is that I didn t realise that  mature and mellow  means  tasteless  in Mr Tesco speak. Also  creamy texture  means  leave my mouth devoid of any moisture .   I do wonder if perhaps your normal range Stilton is  in fact  just a lump of chalk that someone has drawn blue lines on?  What I would like to know is  am I wrong? Or do you have a chimp with a computer writing your product descriptions?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/396973_10156652236225066_7161822952489811489_n.jpg?oh=401ce115784178559c41c67658fc4db8&oe=590F42A2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/396973_10156652236225066_7161822952489811489_n.jpg?oh=80df1eb28722f21c2a01db96879cd2d7&oe=591F795D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156652236225066&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-16T22:27:25+0000	1458167245	2016-03-16 23:27:25	13	15	15	2	32	14	11	3	34	0	13	0	0	2	0	0	0

You have lads 18+ playing football  reving the life out of there sooped up Diddy cars and tear arsing down the car park. Or just generally hanging around. It s about time your security did something to clear the car park and keep it clear or does your customers safety not mean anything to you.					2016-03-16T21:54:48+0000	1458165288	2016-03-16 22:54:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have two really close adult friends who are both deaf and use British Sign Language to communicate. They would both like an eye test. As most people can appreciate it would be hard to understand or reply in a language you wouldn t know! So I asked your opticians if they can provide an interpreter for access to the service you provide.  Sounds fair enough doesn t it?  However the response I got intruiged me!   1. So first of all they would have make an appointment in store?  Why couldn t they book online like other people?  2. A staff member could interpret? Unless they have had training of at least 3 years they are not a qualified Interpreter!  3. They pay themselves! So that s around a minimum of around £30 extra for them to access a promoted free service?  I would like to know what you think about this?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10401133_916798958435565_1283012170849207144_n.jpg?oh=1472c41e77963fe4e07ba9ced8f3db84&oe=591CB46B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10401133_916798958435565_1283012170849207144_n.jpg?oh=6dad1c89e72744e77626eae14e85ec90&oe=59164E94	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=916798958435565&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-16T21:43:30+0000	1458164610	2016-03-16 22:43:30	0	9	0	1	10	8	2	6	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was dicing some chicken earlier tonight and came across this in my  boneless  chicken portions. I m hoping you can see from the top picture how sharpe the object is. It felt like plastic but as it looked like it had blood Insitu I can only imagine it s bone/Cartilage of some kind. I was unable to  snap  it with force. Totally put me and my husband off eating our dinner. Luckily we don t have small children but this is an absolute choking/respiratory/gastric hazard to them and all other customers who may come across this. Really concerning as you can see it was larger than a thumbnail.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12650948_10156537718945136_5129973590033133648_n.jpg?oh=81b305551d25a1f1eaeae032c332deeb&oe=590CE0B0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12650948_10156537718945136_5129973590033133648_n.jpg?oh=eb5a8af56b74367e7818a2c2ba875f38&oe=591372BD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156537718945136&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-16T21:33:12+0000	1458163992	2016-03-16 22:33:12	1	4	2	1	7	3	3	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

Worst thing is i would never have used it if i had known it wasnt tesco and when i rang the store to complain was told its nothing to do with them! Well not only will i never use the car wash again i will also never shop there again!!					2016-03-16T20:29:20+0000	1458160160	2016-03-16 21:29:20	1	4	1	1	6	4	3	1	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As we most often do click and collect it means I dont always get chance to go into Tesco itself to put money on my Clubcard for Christmas Savers. Is there any chance that a tick box with an amount could be added to online shopping? At checkout we could choose to add some money to our christmas savers throughout the year then. do you think this could be a possibility? I am sure many others would love this service.					2016-03-16T19:33:11+0000	1458156791	2016-03-16 20:33:11	3	2	3	1	6	2	1	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every week I have problems. From items being missing  to payment issues. To items that have a short date meaning the next day! My delivery was meant to be here between 3-4 it is now nearly 5 and I have been told it will be here when ever the delivery driver has done his last delivery. No time scale at all. Was promised by Cirencester store it would 100% be here by 4 when I phoned at 3:45. Spoke to someone from your delivery team and was told it s the banks fault and I need to contact them. I ve spoken to my bank previously and have been told there is no reason you can t take the payment. This happens every week. Was told they have tried to ring me ALL DAY- lies!  Was told there was no complaints department and no one I could speak to. After standing my ground I was put through to a manager who again told me it was my issue with the bank not tescos issue.

Two online orders now you have sent me and sent produce from Israel. You have a box for INSTRUCTIONS TO PACKERS when you order online and both times I have written in NO PRODUCE FROM ISRAEL. I even rang last week and one of your employees put a note in our order to make sure there would be no produce from Israel next time. No more orders from Tesco now seeing as you clearly can t follow simple instructions. You know you re not the only supermarket in the UK right?!					2016-03-16T15:55:29+0000	1458143729	2016-03-16 16:55:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The delivery driver arrived promptly and was very polite (as normal).  He said there was only one substitution  and that jam doughnuts had been substituted with jam doughnuts.  Only when I unpack a bag containing 3 packs of bananas  do I come across 1 flattened jam doughnut in a food bag!  I can t understand the sense of the picker who d substitute a pk of 5 @ 65p  for 1 @ 30p.  Why would I order 5 if I wanted 1?  Then to shove it in a food bag and pack it at the bottom of a bag that contains 3 bunches of bananas!

They said it would arrive by 10.05pm and offered me a £5 voucher. Come half 10 and the delivery still hadn t arrived. I asked for it to be rearranged for 8-9pm today and then received an email saying it would arrive between 8-9am.... Great.   I then received a call at half 11 from the driver asking for directions. I explained I had rearranged the delivery.   The delivery just arrived  35 minutes late.

I normally buy the pull up version or the green packet but as I was without car and needed a compact pack to get home I tried these. I wish I hadn t. They re disgraceful. This morning alone I ve had 2 instances of them not doing the basic job they need to do. I won t go into details but it wasn t pretty!!!  So disappointed as now I ve got to go and buy more nappies and throw nearly a whole pack in the bin!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1947541_10153465014832654_2913723914167854082_n.jpg?oh=127c65f54da4c2d8b349cd075a2ed680&oe=591239A6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1947541_10153465014832654_2913723914167854082_n.jpg?oh=eca640ee84af819921b4d354e3928d3a&oe=5909A5B3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153465014832654&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-16T08:46:53+0000	1458118013	2016-03-16 09:46:53	1	11	1	0	12	11	6	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sure energy drinks aren t great for you  but they re worse with a huge amount of sugar in them. Just had to pay 39% more for the privilege of buying the one product in the range not containing it.

After an hour in some cases the nappy is leaking and hanging off my boy with the velcro strips barely holding. I have to change him more often and use more nappies. I am really hoping it s a bad batch? And not a change in the nappy that is staying?					2016-03-16T07:34:16+0000	1458113656	2016-03-16 08:34:16	0	6	0	0	6	6	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my friend went there tonight to buy ingredients to recreate our favourite meal from our favourite restaurant.  After buying our scallops from the fish counter we were advised to ask Morag the best way to cook them. Not only did she do this but she personally walked us through the store to show us the best items to buy. Oor morag was a fountain of knowledge when it came to the best parma ham and black pudding tesco had to offer. After telling us exactly how to prepare and cook our meal we were left more than satisfied. If it wasnt for Morag god knows what we woukd have sat down to. Pls give this woman a raise.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1914773_10209138204918820_2356976744457986738_n.jpg?oh=01a83545d4947ffaa1e2bc4a47032013&oe=58D762CB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1914773_10209138204918820_2356976744457986738_n.jpg?oh=8b5da45b09902d824755a62942b1d5ea&oe=590B99DE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209138204918820&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-15T23:51:31+0000	1458085891	2016-03-16 00:51:31	44	2	46	0	48	2	2	0	5	0	43	1	0	0	0	0	0

Lets see if i get a response.   To whom it may concern   I am very disappointed with your own brand tesco nappies ultra dry tesco loves baby.  I purchased these a few days ago and since using them.i am habing to change my daughters nappy every hour. The nappy on my daughter is not even full when leaking simce buying these i have used the full 30 nappies which would usually last nearly a week since she does have nappy free days (she is 19 month) they have lasted 3 days. I am very angry as i had to go to another competitive brand and spend more money. I have since using your brand used double washing liquid and softener washing double the amount clothes and sofa furniture because of my daughter leaks which has used more electric causing more cost to myself and my husband.  I shall not be buying anymore of your own branded things and will be putting my review across to other people.

I will be recycling this all but I think it s very wasteful in the first place. I have included a photo of my order and all the packaging!

I just went to do a bit of shopping and had to end up changing my son s bum in the back seat of my car because your customer toilets are not equipped for babies. It was either that or the toilet floor! Asked why and not much feedback there. It s meant to be a superstore too. Certainly won t be going back there with my baby anytime soon.					2016-03-15T18:23:58+0000	1458066238	2016-03-15 19:23:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Order some fruit shoot flavoured waters packet was busted and bottles were damaged so had to bin the 3 damaged bottles. I was charged 40p for carrier bags but one crate of my shopping was all unbagged  One bottle of Alize was missing.   I am seriously considering switching to Sainsburys as I seem to have problem after problem and all Tesco do is give out £5 voucher.   I was late going out that day due to having to wait in and was fuming.   The amount of times things go wrong out weights the times things go right with Tescos.    Sell by dates are increasingly getting worse although I always ask for latest sell by dates.   The list is endless.   Sick of having to ring up too as it just annoys me.					2016-03-15T17:28:50+0000	1458062930	2016-03-15 18:28:50	1	13	1	0	14	12	5	7	11	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After a few days I was ready to munch on my snack but when I picked up a rather large strawberry I was greeted by the sight of a  little friend . Apparently a spider the size of a large strawberry (you can see he is at least four bubble wrap bubbles big  picture that with your fingers) had already claimed the batch as his (or her) own. Mind you  I had to take the plastic wrap off of the little plastic basket first and therefore I am 100% sure the spider was already in there when I bought it.   After a little mental breakdown where I questioned the meaning of life and whether or not the burn my home and move somewhere else I found myself brave enough to take the combination outside and take a picture before crying myself to sleep ( ;] )   Not only did I not got to enjoy my beloved strawberries but I am also not comfortable anymore with buying fresh fruits anywhere. Not after having read the story of the little kid who got paralyzed after eating his banana two weeks ago.  (see: http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/world-news/boy-2-paralysed-after-being-7391723)  What I am trying to say is; you might want to check your food better as this was not a fun experience at all.   I bought the strawberries in Ireland at the Dublin - Omni store  Kind regards    Celina (and the spider)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1928926_1026944077377849_4008932516645052863_n.jpg?oh=a7d81df1f49ce103b492d119849a1a72&oe=591EE3A1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1928926_1026944077377849_4008932516645052863_n.jpg?oh=b72849e053ab8183fb8cffd8c50d94a5&oe=5907B65E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1026944077377849&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-15T16:50:06+0000	1458060606	2016-03-15 17:50:06	5	3	6	0	9	3	1	2	0	0	5	0	0	0	1	0	0

My delivery was covered in leaking bleach/flash liquid and dishwasher salt yesterday  which also had my bread in the tray!! The packer at Tesco s hadn t put any of the chemicals in protective bags. So my goods were sent back and I had to clean up the mess on my kitchen floor.  All I have received back was a £15 good will E voucher (but you have to spend £40 to qualify for a delivery!!!) so it s a rip off to make you use them again. The cheeky woman last night didn t even refund any of my damaged items back to me  so I d of paid for them out of the vouchers!!!!  Even when I called them just now to say I didn t want an E voucher and I would like an in-store voucher instead  they said they can t do that! Even after explaining to them I won t be having an online shop with them again  due to careless packing/damaged goods and lack of good dates to use the products. They haven t even responded to my email ... Bye bye Tesco s!!!					2016-03-15T15:44:19+0000	1458056659	2016-03-15 16:44:19	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought this was amazing customer service as very few would take the time out to do this especially as it being a busy period at the time. Every time I go in Gary is just as polite and helpful as always. I feel he should show the rest of the store what customer service is all about.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/12066709_10209322721170771_444915585_n.jpg?oh=9f94e56c4cfc77bcdb41f7c48d8e49e1&oe=59091090	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/12066709_10209322721170771_444915585_n.jpg?oh=d99d32cbd5618182d975223ae03baa34&oe=59096CC4	https://www.facebook.com/10212165532559279/videos/10209322716210647	facebook.com	2016-03-15T13:38:20+0000	1458049100	2016-03-15 14:38:20	2	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

Did not arrive  nor did I receive so much as a text or phone call  as can be proven by my phone logs. On form and on my front door it states clearly that the bell is not working and to knock on brown wooden inner door  which is guaranteed to set my dogs off on a barking fit.  Did not happen.  Phoned up this morning  got put on to local store  was apparently my fault for not being in. The driver apparently DID try to phone me.  Yeah  right.  Check his call logs  he is the one being economical with the truth  NOT ME.  Not that I can blame him not wanting to climb my steps. The woman who spoke to me said her manager was on short break and would call me back as soon as her break was over.  No apology as clearly I was lying.  That was 2 hours ago.  Got contacted a couple of minutes ago.  Will accept delivery out of desperation because I m hungry......					2016-03-15T13:14:40+0000	1458047680	2016-03-15 14:14:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In fact  my Meal Deal has remain unchanged for the past 5 years and encompasses the flavour behemoth of American themed sandwich and Pickled Onion Monster Munch  washed down with Diet Coke.   I have noticed over the past week that there are problems at the pulled pork plant. Previously the exciting flavour of BBQ sauce would exude through the strings of pulled pork but someone I fear has forgotten to top up the sauce. Please find attached exhibit 1 photograph of said sandwich. Please note distinct lack of sauciness.  Has the recipe been changed or are you cutting back?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10376863_10153467944346381_4493355144511733478_n.jpg?oh=909d923b88ac03f50154573011a05c6d&oe=59227567	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10376863_10153467944346381_4493355144511733478_n.jpg?oh=2f2a8f79132ec164647af6c997acf80e&oe=58D5F56A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153467944346381&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-15T12:43:01+0000	1458045781	2016-03-15 13:43:01	7	15	7	0	22	15	4	11	7	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are in the G23 5EH area.  He arrived as scheduled this morning but because of gas mains work in the area and road restrictions he couldn t park to make the delivery.  He called and explained the problem and offered to try again when he was in the area around lunchtime.  This he did and found a space near enough that he was able to complete our delivery  for which we are very grateful.  John went beyond what was required and made sure we weren t inconvenienced an any way.  He is an absolute credit to your company and I would appreciate it if his immediate managers could be told how impressed I was by his efforts today.					2016-03-15T12:37:36+0000	1458045456	2016-03-15 13:37:36	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

After using the delivery service multiple times in the past  and being a little strapped for cash this month decided to save a little on delivery costs and decided to try out the click and collect service at my local store. I booked the 9-11am slot and find it extremely annoying when I get a call at 10.30am from your employee asking me how long i will be because his waiting in the car park... I mean are you kidding me!!! when i have previously had deliveries late and more often than not they show up in the last few mins  to have your employee phone me because his bored of sitting in the car park!!!

Under consumer law  for this to have developed a fault within 6 months  the fault can be assumed to have been there when it was purchased. I could ask for a replacement or a refund.  My husband phoned Tesco Direct on 29th February and asked for a refund or replacement.  They said we had to deal with Hotpoint. When he questioned this  he was told that an engineer would have to call and look at it and this was the procedure they had to follow before any action could be done.  So an engineer came (nearly 2 weeks later).  He said he would have to order a new front panel and a new drum  which would take almost a week.  Husband phoned Tesco Direct that same day (March 10th) and told them what the engineer had said and that we would like a refund or replacement. Tesco Direct told him that it was nothing to do with them and that we had to deal with Hotpoint. WRONG! By law  the retailer is responsible. Tesco should be aware of this (I m quite sure they are).  We were told that my concerns would be passed to the customer care team and they would be on to it quickly and call us back within 24 hours.    Husband rang again and spoke to Dale (AAD3). He told him that they used Hotpoint as a ‘dropshipper’ and it was their responsibility now.  Husband told him that we purchased the item from Tesco (not a Tesco partner) and it was Tesco’s responsibility (by law). Asked when the customer care team would contact me but he had no record of my earlier call! He said he would check the recordings of the calls made when we said my call took place and would get back to us.  He rang me back the next day (March 11th) and said he had checked the call and we had indeed been told our complaint would be passed to customer care but this had not happened.  He apologised and said he would himself pass it to customer care and they would get back to us within 24 to 48 hours. He said he would ring the next day to ‘keep us in the loop’. It’s now 15th March and we’ve had no call from anyone at Tesco.  Been unable to use the dryer for nearly 3 weeks now.  Tesco are blatantly breaking the law by saying it is nothing to do with them.  I do not want major repairs doing on an appliance that was 4 months old when I reported the fault.  I have the right to a refund or replacement.  Tesco know this but just try to fob you off.  Will never buy items like this from them again.					2016-03-15T11:22:54+0000	1458040974	2016-03-15 12:22:54	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered a tumble dryer on the 6th march and because of my  remote location  it couldn t be delivered till today. Got a text yesterday saying it would be delivered between 11 and 2 today. So I organised to have time off work so that I could be in when it was delivered. At ten past 9 today I get a call saying you have run out of stock and I ll get one when you get them back in stock but you can t tell me when that is. For a young family living in a flat having no means to dry clothing for over a week and no end in sight it is very frustrating. If you hadn t already taken my money I would have cancelled the order and gone somewhere where they actually do have stock.					2016-03-15T10:10:07+0000	1458036607	2016-03-15 11:10:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I collected a click and collect order to find some was missing and needed to return to store. Nothing was too much for her and she collected the order for me quickly and also arranged a small refund for me having to return which she didnt need to do. I know most people would of just refunded the items but she made sure I had a complete shop. I just wanted to make sure she is recognised for excellent customer service.					2016-03-15T08:34:36+0000	1458030876	2016-03-15 09:34:36	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last week my 80 year old mum had been shopping in tesco at Roneo corner  Romford when a group of  ladies  opened her car door placed a map over her lap and completely disorientated her and stole her bank card! Before she even knew they had taken it security were out and had caught them all  apparently they saw them watching her at the checkouts and had been watching the whole thing. They bought her a tea and sat with her til the police came. Today she went in again and the security man found her and asked her how she was feeling! I believe his name is Neil.just wanted to say thanks and give them all the recognition they deserve x					2016-03-14T22:09:06+0000	1457993346	2016-03-14 23:09:06	1444	79	1471	287	1837	67	61	6	108	0	1428	22	5	0	0	0	0

These girls were laughing and taking the mick out of another staff member who is deaf and a lovely indvidual in front of me while I was packing my shopping.  I asked for a manager and he said he would speak to them. I have since found out nothing has been done about them. I want this looked into and taken further. No one deserves this from their colleagues nor do I wish to witness it while I m spending money in the shop!  No customer service skills at all  as soon as I said what I saw  they treated me disgustingly too! This has really made me not want to shop at tesco now  knowing there s people like that working there and nothing reasonable gets done about it.

Veggies can buy Quorn mince  there are only a handful of vegan soya mince suppliers  Tesco was one of them. Sainsbury s are still vegan  so guess where vegans will now shop?  It s quite surprising as you re launching some very tasty vegan-suitable summer lines  but mince is a staple and other supermarkets (Morrison s too) are really improving and increasing their vegan range and you re taking a longstanding staple ingredient for many off the shelves?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12814533_1049329728422663_4217345960036696113_n.jpg?oh=4a8ad089ab400a6229f65724daa1ddd1&oe=590FB812	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12814533_1049329728422663_4217345960036696113_n.jpg?oh=f365b0720f60c7852df49678d2064e19&oe=58D5B679	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1049329728422663&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-14T20:58:42+0000	1457989122	2016-03-14 21:58:42	2	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the Daisley household  we traditionally eat pie to mark the occasion. I like to use Puff Pastry. You may like to look at the picture of the pie I made last year which I have attached.   Nice  isn t it?   Anyway  I ll keep this short  as I am blind-baking this years offering.  I am using the same pie dish as last year as I don t like change. There is a subtle difference though  which is the lack of mathematical symbols and fowl adornments  and no thick plaited crust crudely fashioned from offcuts of pastry. My favourite bit.  Why? Well  let me get to the point of this missive. It s the Puff Pastry sheets. They. Are. Tiny. Tiny and square.  In fact they measure just shy of 26 cms  long and wide. Surely they should be rectangular? They always have been before! Why the change  Tesco?   I feel cheated. Is this some horrid production line error or cruel exploitation in the form of shrinkflation?  We all know that ready rolled pastry sheets are rectangles? And like I said  I don t like change.   Although I would welcome a change in the recipe to not include palm oil. Horrible stuff  bad for wild life.   Help me out please  Tesco!

I ordered the strawberry meringue ones and the ones with toffee hoops  for some unknown reason it doesn t tell the picker which ones are chosen  I spoke to somebody last week who said this issue would be resolved and I could also leave notes for the picker  after an hour of looking for an option to leave notes last night I gave up!! I will send a screenshot of that too. I was told very abruptly I won t be refunded for the yoghurts despite it being an error on behalf of your online system! Seriously not happy with the service from tesco and its put me off shopping there in future.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1618541_1680540092205391_1336650917578873375_n.jpg?oh=89210f1db396f9c11306245e208cecfc&oe=5920049C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1618541_1680540092205391_1336650917578873375_n.jpg?oh=113d727e21466810e963664bd0507dfd&oe=59069563	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1680540092205391&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-14T18:01:22+0000	1457978482	2016-03-14 19:01:22	0	27	0	0	27	27	5	22	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

To give you some background to this tale of woe  I purchased in good faith  a Hotpoint washing machine from your good selves in October 2015.  Having purchased many other white goods appliances from yourselves in the past  I looked forward to a smooth  hassle free and long lived ownership of this essential nay necessary; kitchen item.  Alas  as it turned out  we never actually received confirmation of delivery of the washing machine and it wasn`t until we actually contacted you to advise you of this  that we were informed you could not deal with this and we had to deal directly with Hotpoint.  Somewhere along the line  after numerous phone calls and a great deal of time listening to your delightful hold music  a confirmed delivery date was agreed  some 7-10 days after the original date.  Fast forward to the 21st February 2016 when  in time honoured tradition our (almost) brand new washing machine began to experience intermittent faults and a blatant refusal to operate.  No amount of coaxing  verbal abuse or whipping with a willow branch seemed to alleviate the issue.  “No problem” I thought.  “Hotpoint will sort us out.  No worries.”  Here begineth the problems.  Upon calling the number affixed to the front of the machine  we were advised by a rather dreary sounding customer services chap on the end of the phone that we could not and should not  expect anyone to come out and look at our issue for at least 8 days.  Nonetheless  he would be more than happy to sell me additional insurance cover  in case my appliance developed further faults down the line.  Why Hotpoint are training their customer service operators to sell insurance on a fault line is pretty much beyond me; nonetheless I digress.  As we were in no position to argue  we were forced to acquiesce to this proposal and looked forward to the forthcoming 8 days of dirty clothes accumulation.    Here`s where it gets interesting.  Shortly thereafter  I received a phone call from a rather cheery customer services rep to let me know that despite assurances  no one in fact would be coming out to repair the washing machine on the agreed date as the fault code we were experiencing would in fact require replacement parts  which  guess what. were not in stock.  Upon enquiring when stock would be available  the closest I could get was “soon.”  Excellent.  I love “soon”.  It`s what I often tell my children when they ask about a raise in pocket money. “Soon.”  It was at this stage that I had an epiphany and realised that the original purchase of the washing machine was actually through Tesco and not Hotpoint and therefore resolved to pass the issue to your good selves  particularly as Hotpoint were being about as useful as King Canute was turning back the tide.   Sadly  my misguided optimism in your ability to speed up the repair process or at the very least provide a definitive timescale  proved beyond your capabilities.  I`m not sure why it proved so difficult to locate a spare part but in my head I imagine a scenario akin to King Arthur attempting to locate a shrubbery.  A nice one. Nevertheless  both myself and my partner received repeated phone calls to let us know that parts were still not in stock but would be available “soon.”  I love that word.  I really do.  Soon.  We also received more than one phone call from you explaining that the service we had received was not what could and should be expected and that you were prepared to make a “gesture” following the successful repair  of our forlorn washing machine.  Needless to say  we were both on tenterhooks after being advised of this.  The extent of the gesture was to remain a secret though.  Nothing like anticipation.  I`m sure you can appreciate at this stage  being without a washing machine was beginning to incur significant difficulties  particularly when trying to find a clean pair of kecks to wear in the morning.  I`m no prude  but I do enjoy the feeling of freshly washed cotton (and sometimes satin) on my backside of a morning.  I`m not averse to turning the old Y-fronts inside out to get some extra wear but by this point  the situation was getting critical.  My partner however  is slightly less forgiving and refuses point blank to even consider turning anything inside out at any time.  She`s a keeper!  After a considerable delay  we received confirmation that the (by now) mythical spare parts had been located (hurray) and would be available for install on the 11th March 2016 ( a good 19 days after first reporting the fault).  I`m happy to report that  the mission was a success and our washing machine is currently operating at maximum capacity and my buttocks are once again clad in freshly laundered undergarments.   The tale of woe finishes with the “gesture.”  Whilst we are under no illusions that a gesture need be provided  following the conversations we had with your (very apologetic) customer services team combined with the length of time we have been without a washing machine  the gesture received is somewhat lacking.  When I say lacking  I mean non-existent. Nada. Nowt. Nothing.  Less substance than the contents of a partially filled whoopee cushion.  Not even a shrubbery (nice or otherwise). Needless to say  the whole experience has been particularly disappointing and it`s highly unlikely we will approach you for any future white goods purchases.  Or if we do  it`ll be………”soon”					2016-03-14T17:51:49+0000	1457977909	2016-03-14 18:51:49	69	21	85	9	115	21	14	7	15	0	69	7	0	9	0	0	0

I save my clubcard points  I use Tesco to fill both cars  we buy all our shopping from you on a weekly basis  we buy top up shopping from you  we purchase presents  we even have our car insurance through Tesco. Yet yesterday there was an issue with my card and instead of calling me about this Tesco decided to just not turn up. My delivery was due on my only day off between 12-1pm. I waited in for this and at 1:20 I called and questioned where it was. I was told that it had been delivered  clearly not as to why I was calling asking where it was. He then called the shop and they informed that the van had it and had missed it and payment had been declined. He came back to me and apologised as they should have contacted me. (My contact details being correct as I was contacted 3 times last week about my delivery being over an hour late) the man on the phone then explained that they had retried the payment and it was successful and the delivery was still on the van so I would be contacted shortly as to what time it was to be delivered. I waited and by 6pm realised that maybe the shopping I had now paid over £70 for was not coming.... Kids then went to school today  had to explain why there was no pack lunches and why they were to have school dinners  extra expense  then I had to go to work without breakfast and lunch  had to buy  extra expense. Came home to still no food and I called back up. The best bit still to come..... They would have had no idea that it wasn t delivered had I not called! And ......it wasn t to be delivered! And then the options I m given. Wait for it.... I can pay again 😂😂😂 or I can not have my shopping delivered. Let me explain. I can pay again and have the previous money refunded then they can arrange a delivery  I assumed for tomorrow  or I can just have my money refunded and not have my shopping. I know I was so torn as to which to choose I almost lost my mind with excitement. When I asked if he was being serious he actually said yes 😐 so now I m still without food. I have to go to a shop WITH my children 😩😩 and do a full shop load. I know it s done but for many years I have deliberately paid for a delivery saver and religiously arrange my shopping to be delivered as this feels me with horror with all your strategically placed products it costs me a fortune!!  On a more serious note though I am appalled and have cancelled my delivery saver and will not be shopping with you again. For a loyal customer  in fact any customer  to be treated like that is very very bad and irresponsible of a company like yourselves to do.					2016-03-14T16:20:28+0000	1457972428	2016-03-14 17:20:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did mention this to a member of staff who said they would tell the so called chef  who did not rush out and see what the problem was. so i left. I travel the country doing 3-4 000 miles a week most weeks and the quality of cooked food you offer varies all around the country. yet when i visit a transport cafe or a Sainsbury the quality of cooked food offered is consistent and hot (not microwaved hot) As you have managed to lay your stores out in a uniform manner is it not possible to improve the quality of the food you serve in you cafe  other companies manage toso why can t Tesco					2016-03-14T15:01:28+0000	1457967688	2016-03-14 16:01:28	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have just had a phone call from her that says someone in the store had stolen her handbag with her purse and phone in it and precious irreplaceable pictures of my Granddad whom we lost 2 years ago. She didn t realise until she got to the checkout and checked her shopping bag to find her bag stolen. The staff looked after her and paid for her food.  You have no idea how happy that has made us and how we value the fact that instead of fobbing her off (as some supermarkets would do) you looked after her and helped her.

Seems ridiculous you didn t even have the smallest selection to offer.					2016-03-14T13:31:49+0000	1457962309	2016-03-14 14:31:49	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is still at full price at Worksop and other stores in the area just not Mansfield. Had I not already set the water butt up I would be returning it back to save a fiver. Not happy about this at all as surely your prices should be the same store to store and we shouldn t have to price check between Tesco stores!!					2016-03-14T13:05:20+0000	1457960720	2016-03-14 14:05:20	2	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco is the supermarket that we use all the time and have done for many years  In fact  we even bought shares in the company.  Earlier today  my wife and I decided to try Tesco Finest Curries for our evening meal and chose Lamb Rogan Josh and Chicken Korma. We also purchased two large Samosas and two large Bhajees from the deli counter.  Sadly  the curries were bland and tasteless ( possibly the worst we have tasted ) but the rest of our purchases were equally sub-standard.  I am a supporter of Tesco but  on this occasion I had to share my thoughts. Selling food like this will do nothing to enhance the company s reputation.					2016-03-14T11:41:00+0000	1457955660	2016-03-14 12:41:00	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got a phone call from Lisa in store to say they d had a problem with the vans and one of the managers  Barry  was going to bring our shopping to us at 10pm at night in his own car.  Poor Barry!!  He probably just wanted to get home after a long shift  but he ended up carrying a load of groceries into our house.  Very much appreciated and great service from our local Tesco!					2016-03-14T08:33:29+0000	1457944409	2016-03-14 09:33:29	3	2	3	0	5	2	1	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sitting in his van with the engine running  my husband asked could he back up saves me have to push my daughters pushchair in the road. Has he had taken up the whole kirb and could have parked on the road. To be told where to go he can park where ever he wants and to hell with anyone else. The result was my 4 year old daughter having a meltdown ( she s Autistic) as when I took her in the road to walk around his van a car came round the corner. She has a real big fear of anything coming towards her. Took an hour to try an calm her down.  Every little helps not in this account. Don t think I will be making the journey to use your stores.

I received my weeks of extra savings vouchers & week 1 runs out today. I ordered my food for the week today & when it came to paying & using my voucher it told me my voucher wasn t valid because I had booked a pick up slot on 14th March (day after it is no longer valid) This seems unfair considering I m paying today  a day it is still valid on. No where on the voucher does it explain that it has to include the delivery day also. I am therefore missing a £7 saving that I m entitled too for my loyalty to Tesco & continual use of my club card. I would appreciate an explanation on this as quickly as possible. Thank you.					2016-03-13T19:55:22+0000	1457898922	2016-03-13 20:55:22	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This isn t really great  as lots of people don t actually finish work till after 4pm...even at the weekend. Seems a bit funny in a 24 hour store too.  In fact  there have been many times when I ve tried on clothes in this store after 4pm.  Is this a new thing  or was it because she was too busy chatting to her mate and couldn t be bothered?					2016-03-13T19:54:59+0000	1457898899	2016-03-13 20:54:59	0	7	0	0	7	7	5	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Advertised as  easy and comfortable relief  you have to be kidding. I woke up a few hours later with cold sweats  excruciating stomach cramps  general weakness and very nearly passed out. There needs to be a firmer warning with this product  or at least a change in wording on the packaging. Absolutely awful experience and I still feel terrible now.					2016-03-13T19:40:49+0000	1457898049	2016-03-13 20:40:49	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Completely out of date... bought on 7/03 and dated best before 22/02! Did not expect that from Tesco! Complete inconvenience having to return the pack  as I do not have my own transport... But what was even more shocking is that although I returned the pack and informed the customer services  when I was shopping later in the week (12/03) I checked the shelf only to find the packages (all flavours  not only the carrot cakes) still there and still all completely out of date!

It is labelled as hypoallergenic but my daughter immediately came out in a rash from head to toe  and the skin under her eyes became puffy. Having spoken to a dr they have ruled out it being anything other than just an allergic reaction  and she hasn t got sensitive skin either. I obviously cannot post pictures of my daughters body publicly but will happily send via a private message. I d like to ask why such a product is labelled as hypoallergenic and perfect for newborns when my 4 year old has had such an awful reaction? I wouldn t recommend anybody to use this product on their child of any age!! 😡😡	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12321243_10156580895500317_4043646209488344640_n.jpg?oh=ece7a40562dccbdc9c78ab0b38500587&oe=58D7542D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12321243_10156580895500317_4043646209488344640_n.jpg?oh=b3915e40fe1f95eba96cf6b984ba05e8&oe=5911E620	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156580895500317&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-13T19:17:12+0000	1457896632	2016-03-13 20:17:12	0	11	2	0	13	10	3	7	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

How will everybody react then. You Ain t Seen Nothing Yet as the saying goes. Very few seem to realise that some food ie cooked meat  even milk can be put in the freezer and still can be consumed after being thawed. Do these items say on the label Suitable For Freezing though?

But wanted it filleting in to two sides.  I was told I would need to wait 20mins  the lady who worked on the fish counter was on her break. & the back up was off sick. Surely for a superstore there should be 3 trained fishmongers. In the event that one calls in sick  the other two can cover each other s breaks. So I didn t buy a salmon  not a happy customer. & you lost £12.					2016-03-13T15:47:58+0000	1457884078	2016-03-13 16:47:58	0	9	0	0	9	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

First complaint: we needed to use one of the stores wheelchairs  so we went to the customer service desk to be told  they re normally over there  As she pointed to the area where the tills are (along by the photo booth) so I left my aunt at the desk & I went to that area  no wheelchairs. So I asked again if she knew where they might be   sometimes people leave them in the entrance where the cash points are  have a look there  so again I went to have a look  I found one out in the outer entrance which had obviously been dumped there. It was wet & had only one handle grip. I have to say I m pretty disappointed that there was no offer by the staff to go & find a wheelchair  especially since my elderly aunt had already had to walk into the store to the customer service desk  & she ended up having to sit on the lower part of the counter as she can t stand for long. I really thought you might have a better service for disabled customers  or at least be a bit more compassionate towards them.  Second complaint  we bought one of your bakery s ready baked rhubarb pies  which looked lovely on the outside. However when I cut into it to serve it for pudding on Wednesday night I discovered that the pastry wasn t cooked  not just slightly under baked  it was raw in the middle & the underneath was raw too. Im guessing that the bakers just looked at the crust (which was a lovely brown crust fully baked) & decided the rest was cooked. I ve taken some pics of a piece in the tray  along with the raw pastry from the base which was stuck to the tray when I removed the other pieces. I know not every item is perfect but for it to be totally raw is just plain incompetence.  I look forward to your response.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12821377_10208962698695552_5751253493346727731_n.jpg?oh=bb7a3fbbb85fbb9793aacf4f31041064&oe=590FADA3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12821377_10208962698695552_5751253493346727731_n.jpg?oh=e3add92615eeb86d019059ff4a30ed9d&oe=5907ACAE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208962698695552&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-13T15:46:32+0000	1457883992	2016-03-13 16:46:32	0	15	0	0	15	15	5	10	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s awkward for one parent to juggle young toddlers and babies to the store from the end of the parent child spaces to get a trolley and would help alot if some trolleys were in grabbing distance :)					2016-03-13T12:56:39+0000	1457873799	2016-03-13 13:56:39	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were shopping approximately 5 minutes. We went to pay  but apparently we were not able to pay until 11am.  This is perfectly reasonable  however I suggested constructively that a sign could be displayed to make people aware (we were not the only people who wanted to pay) I was then told by a member of your team:   it s been the law for years love .   I m not even going to discuss how infuriating it is to be called  love  in such a patronising manner as though this is common knowledge  but more to the point it had nothing to do with the law  I was merely suggesting a sign could be displayed as there were at least 3 other groups of people who walked out behind us for the same reason - WE DIDN T KNOW.  I was further told that they had just done a tannoy announcement (which we had missed as we had just arrived) but the argumentative and passive nature your staff made no sense  I was merely suggesting to make it clearer. I spoke to your staff calmly initially  and suggested a solution for an evident problem and in return I was met my argumentative and defensive staff - I d hate to see anyone that had a genuine complaint or weren t constructive.   So might I suggest to you Tesco - that if you do want to allow people to shop before they can pay  just make it clear. There was NO suggestion while we were in store that we couldn t pay. If you watch your cctv footage of around 10:30 in the morning by the front doors of your store you will see numerous people leaving including ourselves.   I d also suggest training your Stockport managing  and retail staff in some customer service  I ve worked in retail for many years of my life and it seems your staff were looking for trouble or had given up on their role entirely - one gentleman who is supposed to represent your business didn t have a name tag or uniform and yet continued to argue with me and I had to ask him to listen  just to suggest the sign!   If I were in their position is at least be apologetic that a customer had missed this important information rather than patronising them  as it is most definitely the customers inconvenience not your staff s. Hopefully you will see the importance/usefulness of this information to your business unlike your employees that we dealt with today.   Look forward to hearing your thoughts   Lucy					2016-03-13T11:39:41+0000	1457869181	2016-03-13 12:39:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had some delivered 8 days ago and they are still rock hard :(  No doubt they will shrivel up or go mouldy before they ripen :(  Tesco shouldn t be selling any fruit that is not going to ripen with 2 or 3 days.  This is very much a  buying  problem and should not be passed on to the customer.  The situation is made worse by being told that these should be kept in the fridge - but we didn t anyway.					2016-03-12T20:36:24+0000	1457814984	2016-03-12 21:36:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are waiting for a refund for a faulty cot which we have brought from You TESCO. NOT your supplier.   Waiting for the supplier to say if we can have our money back is totally unacceptable we bought from you not the supplier. You claim you are waiting for  The faulty product was accepted to be faulty by the supplier and picked up. This was accepted as faulty due to the photographs we sent.   We did want a full exchange which the  supplier  refused so we asked for a refund. It s been over a week (and the whole saga a month) to get our money back.   Our son is far to big for his Moses basket and is now in bed with us as we wait for what is legally ours. Our money back.   The insensitive patronising lack of empathy your  customer services team  have shown us is beyond a joke. I am so angry I shake as I write this. All I want is my money. I don t want to ever deal with tesco ever again.    We are a working family and with a small baby in bed with us this impacting our family life due to disrupted sleep when he could be sleeping in his cot. Why would I I accept any of this for one moment?					2016-03-12T18:43:47+0000	1457808227	2016-03-12 19:43:47	2	8	2	3	13	8	4	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The manager wasn t concerned at all and simply took it from us then quickly checked the shelves to see if any others were like it  which they were not! If I hadn t seen them moving my mum would have took this home. I am absolutely disgusted and will never eat meat again!!

I went and used the self scan facility   which tots up the value of the shopping  also taking in to count any offers. When I got to the till  it had totted up til £40.51. After I loaded the scanner and went to scan my voucher it wouldn t let me  as the cost had now gone down to just under £39  due to the fact you now take the brand match off the total. I then had to leave my shop and go back and remake up the total to £40. I wasn t happy I had to reshop. When I spoke to Customer Services  they said they didn t know a wsy around it  but could see it being an issue for others.					2016-03-12T17:18:46+0000	1457803126	2016-03-12 18:18:46	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought the jeans to wear to a family party  I tired them on in store and I love them  they are comfortable and fit nicely! When I arrived at the family party the next day (which was 5 hours away from home) I noticed a large tear in the seem near the pocket  it was safe to say I was frustrated and upset that I couldn t wear my brand new jeans to the party. I exchanged the jeans the next evening at my local Tesco s (East Dereham  Tesco Extra)  but I left feeling aggravated due to the poor service I received - although I was able to exchange the trousers for the same size  I was treated unfairly and accused of  considerably wearing  the jeans  though the labels were attached and I had the receipt  luckily for me a manager was called and was more than happy to authorise an exchange due to the nature of the damage on the goods. I have now had the new pair of jeans for 12 days and am really disappointed to have just discovered a tear in the seem on the leg  despite only wearing them a handful of times. I absolutely love these jeans  they are the correct size and they fit perfectly  but they are clearly made with fabric not suitable for everyday wear/use. I would expect a pair of jeans that cost me £18  to last considerably longer than 2 weeks of light wear.   I am so disappointed as I often purchase clothes from Tesco  but will be hesitate when thinking of buying jeans from Tesco s again.   As these have been worn and because of way I was treated upon returning the original product  I am reluctant to go back in store to seek a solution  as well as being hesitant to seek a replacement after the issues I have encountered.   Please advise me on how I should address this complaint.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Phoebe					2016-03-12T15:11:31+0000	1457795491	2016-03-12 16:11:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Did a shop at Tesco this morning and given a receipt that says today I saved £1.61 on my branded shop. On the way home I found myself wondering if I really did  so I sat and put all the branded items into an online basket on Asda website to find that had I shopped for those items there  I d have actually saved just over £11!!

I am writing to you in the hope that you will be able to forward my complaint onto the appropriate department as I was just now unable to find the contact number on your website.   I love sweet potato. Words can not describe how much I love sweet potato. If I could eat only one thing for the rest of my life it would be sweet potato. Or cheesecake. It s a pretty close call  but I think sweet potato would win. Anyway  today I bought four  yes four  packets of the sweet potato chips with rosemary and thyme because I am meal prepping and as discussed earlier  I love sweet potato. Normally I would but them fresh  but I thought I would give these a go  because  who doesn t love a bit of rosemary and thyme?   Why do I love sweet potato so much I hear you cry? Sweet potato is extremely healthy   and plus I love the soft texture that comes with it. So imagine my upset when your packet says to cook the sweet potatoes at 200 degrees for 25-30 minutes and 45 minutes later my sweet potato chips are still undercooked and crunchy. I was not impressed. Furthermore  I have an additional 3 packets of sweet potato fries which have also served me an injustice. This is just not acceptable and poor advertising. And trust me  I know how to cook sweet potatoes  if you haven t gathered by now already.   I trust that you will take me complaint seriously and provide me with some compensation as a result of my lack of satisfaction.   Many thanks   Jennifer Eyers.					2016-03-12T13:31:02+0000	1457789462	2016-03-12 14:31:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I even saw a customer doing this myself removing the magazine showing the tv/radio programmes/ for the week. The customer had no consideation/ thought/to other customers whatsoever. Trying to get the newspaper I wanted that was in good condition was a nightmare even for the security guard. Action has to be taken to ensure this doesn t continue. I don t want others to end up in the same situation.					2016-03-12T13:27:59+0000	1457789279	2016-03-12 14:27:59	0	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

The staff at the princes road store Chelnsford Essex were dressed up as superheroes. I ve seen similar things in other stores but the staff went above and beyond. Playing along with the children telling them to keep their eyes out. My eldest got to have a play sword fight at the check outs and when my 4 year old met iron man in the fruit and veg aisle he was over the moon. He really played up to my son asking him lots of questions and when he said it was his daddy s favourite he said oh well ha e to take a picture to send to him. Fantastic day amazing staff and I ve been food shopping with 3 children at Saturday lunch time !!!!

Of course  this would have been OK if that new label wasn t one of the BIG YELLOW ones  and that the wine was STILL sat under a GREAT OFFERS signboard.  This is blatantly misleading as the Wairu Cove is NOT on offer.  The Managers that I spoke to yesterday were not in the store this morning  but the Duty Manager did ask me what I wanted HIM to do about it.  Sort it  I said. When I left he appeared to be  sorting it   but who knows... <sigh>	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12814807_10208423476283025_2379515902818128343_n.jpg?oh=e3a54f592ce91b061fd90a4a6ffd9c13&oe=59221286	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12814807_10208423476283025_2379515902818128343_n.jpg?oh=a9414cce6ca1005ba1d8673cdbee9c50&oe=5908608B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208423476283025&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-12T09:56:21+0000	1457776581	2016-03-12 10:56:21	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I finally found it  there was none left!! 😱😱 I decided to ask another staff member if there had any on the stock rooms  the young staff member (Taylor  I believe was the name) was incredibly friendly and straight away told me that it was in offer and so it was on the first aisle and accompanied me to the correct place. 10/10 Taylor! I do hope this gets feed back.  Now that I m at it  guys yous need to improve the lighting in the car park  being a woman and usually doing my shopping late night  I do not feel very safe 😉					2016-03-12T00:28:12+0000	1457742492	2016-03-12 01:28:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought a toaster June 2015 with booster points which went wrong a week ago.  Returned it to the Lakeside store where I thought I would be offered an exchange.   Instead I was given a refund of points and I paid £49.95 for a new toaster from Tesco Direct because the store didn t have a new one in stock.  I m now out of pocket for £49.95.					2016-03-11T21:47:42+0000	1457732862	2016-03-11 22:47:42	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m now a new mum to a 4 month old baby girl and we absolutely love the F&F range  but I can t help but feel a little bit disappointed that there s still a lack of clothes for little girls that are designed with  tomboys  in mind.    Obviously my little girl has no say in what I dress her in just yet (poor thing!) but I d love her to take after me with all of the things I loved when I was younger.   Girls can love trains and robots as much as they love Peppa Pig and Minnie Mouse  and I think their clothes should reflect their interests. With that in mind  do you think there is any chance of introducing a clothing line from newborn upwards that might be more suited to this kind of thing?   I ve only found a few online stores that cater for girls that like pink AND dragons  but as I mentioned  we love the F&F range  and I d really love to have a more accessible   affordable alternative.  Please keep me updated if there are any plans to bring something like this into the range  I ll be first in line!

I would also like to inform you that 3 out of 6 eggs were cracked. Although the driver was helpful in stating I would be refunded for the eggs  by then it was a little too late as I then spent the next 15 minutes cleaning egg white off other products & my kitchen work top. I have always received the highest levels of customer care & produce but I m afraid I have been let down on this occasion. Many thanks  Hayley Knight					2016-03-11T20:19:46+0000	1457727586	2016-03-11 21:19:46	2	5	2	0	7	5	3	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I came home from work last night to find a card from Hermes Couriers saying a parcel had been left in my blue bin. Upon inspection there was nothing in my bin. I looked twice. I checked the other bins and the neighbours. Nothing. I became a bit worried as i had placed an order through Tescodirect  two of the items were  being delivered from your suppliers which were toys for my young sons upcoming Birthday. I contacted Hermes who were of absolutely no help and didn t want to take any of the responsibility. Becoming agitated  i called your number for Tesco Direct and was connected quickly to lovely young man named Colin. He quickly put me at ease and promised to sort it out. I am a little embarrassed to say I started crying on the phone (I am 20 weeks pregnant so tears happen without warning just now 😁) Colin wasn t phased by this and assured me he would sort it out. As promised  he called the next day. Colin had been in touch with the suppliers of the toys who told him they were en route to me but not with Hermes  with another courier. Fair enough right? The man had done his job and investigated this for me as he said he would. At least i knew my son s presents weren t missing. I thanked him for all his help and apologised for my previous breakdown. He wished me a nice weekend and we concluded our conversation. It doesn t stop there though. A couple of hours later I had beautiful flowers delivered to my house from Colin and Team at Customer Care in Dundee! A little card was included congratulating me on my pregnancy! I was absolutely speechless as i didn t know customer service like this existed! That is taking it to a whole new level. I just want to thank Colin and his team for this lovely gesture of kindness and for the service they provided. They are an asset to your  company and deserve recognition and maybe a wee bonus? 😉 I still don t know what was in my blue bin as i haven t ordered anything else. I am likely never to find out either if Hermes have anything to do with it. So  to wrap it up Hermes = 0 & shameful  Tesco = 100 & outstanding!! Oh and here is a pic of my flowers which really brightened an otherwise rubbish day. ❤👍	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12799387_773137899454616_6609665791285736197_n.jpg?oh=96e5d7d3176099dafbb60cbff0eb1c0a&oe=58DD1A8D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12799387_773137899454616_6609665791285736197_n.jpg?oh=e54789ba7c40b672d4fb73d7cf343ce5&oe=5913DE72	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=773137899454616&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-11T20:16:00+0000	1457727360	2016-03-11 21:16:00	104	16	107	3	126	16	14	2	21	0	102	3	0	0	0	0	0

It s my day for eating unhealthy amounts of processed chicken. It s Friday today so I popped to my local store to pick up beer and my usual Southern Fried chicken box. Now  maybe I should have looked a little closer but I ve just got home and noticed that my once revered box of Southern fried chicken contains cheese! CHEESE!!! What are cheese filled bites doing in my chicken box??? Cheese is NOT chicken! Not only are these cheese bites not chicken  they actually taste like the Devils snot. You ve ruined my Friday Tesco  and I m not sure I can ever forgive you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1926878_10156541464745459_8084433472134886590_n.jpg?oh=3d521dce442602c77e17d90ed0ad68c0&oe=58D5C6BA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/1926878_10156541464745459_8084433472134886590_n.jpg?oh=40de75ccd49248313910d690a0de8e35&oe=59162FC6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156541464745459&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-11T19:23:45+0000	1457724225	2016-03-11 20:23:45	17	3	17	0	20	2	1	1	1	0	16	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is not the first item from the same online delivery which was substandard. Safe to say I m disgusted at the products I ve received  not to mention the cost of having to throw several items from the delivery away.

When i asked him to back up a bit so i could fit into a space so he could pass he refused. He told me that he would wait all day as he is paid to drive.

This is just another prising trick to cause confusion. I asked two store assistances about this and non could tell me what was going on here. If your store assistances can t work it out how can the general public? The pack on the photo that is marked half price is from a shelf around the corner. This missed priced pack is on the end of the shelving.

We all like the new prizes but to raise the money to £2 per ticket and extending the numbers from 01-59 is pathetic. Go back to the original numbers 01-49 and keep the new prizes that are handed out.					2016-03-11T15:07:46+0000	1457708866	2016-03-11 16:07:46	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Even though it can give saving to your wallet  but it won t guarantee consumer walk out from the premise safe and sound.Car lost and car being broke in  ransacked and even lost of valuables seem like normal at Tesco car park. Ladies handbag being snatched by robbers seem to be a norm at Tesco car park. Nobody willing to rendered a helping hand is one thing  but even the administration of Tesco also doesn t seem to bothered much about the car park security. Or are you try to telling me that the car park security is out of your work scope and it should be fall under public liability? Can sombody out there really answer my question?

A small gesture that really touched me today  I was not having a good day. My mum has recently passed away and after a month of struggling to sort out her bank account (rubbish customer service) I got back from a visit from the bank feeling a little down and upset. To then receive these flowers ( which were one of her favourites) was something I really needed and made my day a little better  keep up the good work.					2016-03-11T14:26:19+0000	1457706379	2016-03-11 15:26:19	7	2	7	4	13	2	2	0	7	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

The first time they took it down was because it  promotes violence  and now they are coming out with its  not for the community  i believe cancer will effect a lot of people in every town so for non professional everyday people to want to take part in a sport and raise money for such a great cause. To then have a poster thrown away when there are other posters in there shop advertising modelling thats not just local is absolute disgusting!

I had purchased something that needed a tag removed. Firstly she refused to remove it until we paid for it in case we were shop lifting  then once we had paid for everything she wanted to remove the tag AFTER she d seen our receipt  to  make sure we had paid for it . I suffer from a visible disability which has affected my face today which she didn t stop starting at  then at my husband as if to imply he d caused an injury!! When I asked for her name I had to ask 5 times which were all ignored and I was only given it when another member of staff said it!!!

Chose to block the lane completely and after waiting I beeped to let him know I was there. Cue him returning and glaring at me  then instead of reserving back as couple of metres he gesticulated aggressively for me to move back. Had he parked a few metres back he could have still made his delivery and traffic could have passed. He did not thank me for waiting and moving back nor did he apologise for blocking the road or making me wait. As a Tesco delivery customer myself  I think this is appalling. Maybe it s time for me to switch.					2016-03-11T13:06:28+0000	1457701588	2016-03-11 14:06:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sadly your Horwich branch aren t. I wanted to change some money as I m away for the weekend. Got to the travel exchange at 9am and was turned away as  we don t open for another few minutes.  Strange time to open at a few minutes past 9.   Came back at 5 minutes past and it honestly looked like I d asked the lady behind the glass to skin her favourite cat by asking her to serve me.   Turns out she wasn t ready and needed  another 15 or 20 minutes.  Why open at 9  or a few minutes past as it turns out  and then not be prepared to serve your customers.   As it turned out  I managed to drive to Asda  get served by a nice friendly young lady  get home and make a brew  all before misery guts would have served me.					2016-03-11T09:39:53+0000	1457689193	2016-03-11 10:39:53	37	12	41	1	54	11	8	3	10	0	35	0	2	2	0	0	0

To you it s a drop in the ocean but to me  a student nurse  it s nearly £300.   That £300 could pay my rent this month  it could buy me 6-8 weeks worth of shopping  it could pay for a months worth of petrol to get me to my placement where I look after people just like you and me.    I ended up having to escalate a complaint of not receiving my shares 3 months after leaving with a similar background of false promises by emailing Dave Lewis. It s amusing how as soon a you involve the big boss  things get sorted fairly sharpish!   It s worrying how hard a company such as yourselves make it for previous employees to get what money they they re owed as I imagine that some people would just accept that they re not going to get it.

We ve just visited and it s in the usual state it always is. Plastic packaging  boxes  stock and cages thrown anywhere and everywhere all over the isles. It s a serious health and safety risk for your customers and it isn t safe working practice at all. If your staff are told to work like this then surely the store shouldn t be 24 hours? I think you need to seriously look at safe working practices here for the sake of your customers  this is not just a one off  it s every single late night we visit and has been going on for months. The only pleasant experience consistently we have is your lovely member of staff  an elderly gentleman who works Tuesday late night on self service  he s always pleasant  chatty and willing to help where he can.

After the call I received an email saying my collection on the  03/05/16 had been cancelled so i assume somebody got the dates wrong for that days collection  so today I once again waited in from 7am-7pm rang someone to double check and was told i was definitely on the list  then it got to 7pm and nobody had been to collect my FAULTY tv. I have now waited in for 3 days. So Tescos  Im obviously annoyed by this  and now I want to know what your going to do? I don t really want to talk to your customer service department again and i really don t want to waste another day waiting in for a driver who may or may not turn up  I would also like my money back for the faulty TV you sold me					2016-03-11T00:21:15+0000	1457655675	2016-03-11 01:21:15	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of the main reasons to visit the store this evening was to pick up the new James Bond film and use the “100 points when you buy any DVD” coupon. The item was scanned by Rachel almost in the middle of our grocery shop and just passed straight down  this was then put in to one of our own bags that we had brought along for packing. At the end of the scanning of items Rachel gave us the total price and we handed over the coupon to redeem our free points  at this point Rachel advised us that we hadn t bought a DVD or Blu ray and so we could not have the extra points  I pulled the film out of the bag and showed it to her  then  much to my amazement she told me “Well  that hasn t gone through my till  YOU must have just put it straight in to your bag without paying for it.” I protested my case and told her it had been scanned  she proceeded to tell me  in an ever increasing accusatory tone that I had bypassed the till with the item and that even the security tag hadn t been removed. Eventually she checked her monitor in front of her and said: “No it definitely hasn t gone through  you have just put it straight in your bag.” so Rachel took the film  scanned it and removed the security tag  we paid and as I had already seen the item listed twice on the receipt (once at the very end and once in the middle of the itemised bill) I showed Rachel the receipt and the fact the same item HAD been scanned twice and therefore I had not bypassed her scanner. An apology was not even mentioned  instead she called one of her colleagues over  Helen  and said “I ve made a boo-boo and scanned this twice” No apology for basically accusing me of attempting to commit an act of shoplifting. To say I was upset would be an understatement. To Compound this even further  and my secondary complaint  Helen (one of the ladies who patrols the areas by the tills just in case of queries) laughed at me when I expressed my displeasure at being accused of attempted theft. Helen told me (after laughing) “Rachel has been here a lot of years she wouldn t mean it like that” I m not really too fussed if Rachel has been there two days or twenty years  to accuse someone of theft  when the evidence is clearly available on screen and on the receipt  is beyond anything I have experienced before from a customer service focussed organisation such as yourselves.   I myself work as a manager for a large industrial solutions and supply company and have to deal on a daily basis with some of the largest blue chip companies across Europe  if I had shown such a poor attitude to my customers  as your staff have shown towards me and my family this evening  I would be losing contracts all over the place. And more seriously  if I had accused some one of trying to steal from me without valid grounds or checking first  I could be facing legal repercussions also.  The only thing I can say is that the young lady at customer services who did credit one of the films did apologise for any inconvenience  but by this point I had had enough. I made my feelings clear (in a polite manner) to all that were involved  but I feel that two of the individuals  Rachel & Helen  clearly were not very focused on their customer service skills  or  general manners this evening  and  as a consequence I am not at all a happy shopper.  Yours Sincerely Stuart Skelton					2016-03-10T22:06:38+0000	1457647598	2016-03-10 23:06:38	25	21	29	17	67	21	13	8	15	0	24	0	4	0	0	0	0

The total lack of respect for your customers is disgusting and customer service even worse. Why do you employ people who clearly cannot speak respectively to your customers?

No telephone call either to inform me of delay and driver did not apologise.   Two crates arrive one crate had shopping in bags the other crate was not bagged and I payed 40p for bags in advance.  Also some of the waters were busted.  Not good - not impressed.					2016-03-10T21:22:48+0000	1457644968	2016-03-10 22:22:48	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They ve turned up tonight and despite saying on your website that there are 16 eggs in a bag there is actually only around 13 (not enough eggs for the amount of children!) To top it off when I was sorting through the bags I found 10 broken ones so practically a whole bag wasted...so there are even less eggs! Not happy Tesco.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12705510_10153503669236243_2040456930740706250_n.jpg?oh=b088d92014f6c8860f1bdf089fa7832c&oe=5908EACC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12705510_10153503669236243_2040456930740706250_n.jpg?oh=a8552d0c8c9ba98682d4466baa9da0a4&oe=59196EC1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153503669236243&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-10T21:20:52+0000	1457644852	2016-03-10 22:20:52	8	2	8	0	10	2	2	0	0	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

Always order from tesco and usually all fine. The driver told me I had one substitution which I was happy with. He failed to tell me that I has a whole chicken and mince that had both had tomorrow s date on which I only noticed after he had left. Somehow I think I might find it difficult to eat a whole chicken and mince at 9pm before tomorrow.					2016-03-10T21:06:11+0000	1457643971	2016-03-10 22:06:11	2	6	2	0	8	6	3	3	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered my Tesco.com shop to be delivered between 8pm and 9pm on Tuesday. At 9pm I received a call to say the driver was running late due to  staffing problems  and he would be with us between 9:30pm and 9:45pm. At 9:50pm still no food shopping so I called the helpline and they tracked down our order which eventually arrived just before 10pm!!! The driver had no paperwork with him therefore I did not know if there were any substitutions  omissions or short dates!!! There was no pda available for us to sign for the order. The driver said a manager from the Worksop branch would call us the following morning (Wednesday) to discuss the issues.   By 6pm on Wednesday no one had called us so I called the helpline to be told no call back had been logged. The operator could not get a response from the store so be logged a call and I was PROMISED I would receive a call from the store today. It s now 8:15pm  I have not received a call and no one has answered on your call centre for 20mins!!!!   I have had to use my email of items ordered to check all our shopping was present  this took a substantial amount of time!

But to still take payment for this order on the 3rd of march   and only notify the customer of this on the 9th and say it should be refunded back in 3-5 days! So for 2 whole wks  tesco keep hold of my weekly food money and just say sorry  admin error is not on. What about bank charges and other bills that could now be messed up.

I have had quite a few friends who have been sent out discount vouchers which offer money off over a specific amount spent but I haven t received this type of offer for months now and can t understand how come.

I have tried calling 4 times and no answer today.					2016-03-10T14:18:19+0000	1457619499	2016-03-10 15:18:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This was witnessed by my brother and he chased after the truck after the driver decided to drive off. Upon confronting him  the driver denied the allegation (despite my brother witnessing the entire episode.)  When contacting Tesco by telephone  we receive no apology and have been told  we are looking into the matter  and yet we have never been contacted with regards to compensation or an apology. The last time we contacted Tesco  we were greeted with animosity  we are not going to speak about this subject  the lady told us and proceeded to hang up on us.  Clearly Tesco supports a culture of damaging people s possessions. Your response to the matter has been abysmal. Quite frankly  I am appalled at your disgusting behaviour and we have decided to shop at another supermarket.					2016-03-10T13:52:09+0000	1457617929	2016-03-10 14:52:09	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The delivery was cancelled due to bad weather (although I had managed to get 3 busses across Stockport that day) and I was not informed that the delivery was cancelled. An hour past my delivery slot I eventually phoned up to check and the cancellation was finally confirmed  but my account had already been debited. I was promised my money would be refunded between 3-5 days  but 6 days later still nothing. I complain through Facebook and I quickly receive both a voicemail and a message to tell me that my refund has been submitted but it will take another 5 days to be in my account. I m a young  recent graduate and to be without £72 in the middle of the month on top of the rest of Tescos shortcomings is insulting and I am clearly not a valued customer. This is ridiculous and it has put some financial strain on me and has been incredibly inconvenient. I will not be shopping at Tesco again.					2016-03-10T13:30:01+0000	1457616601	2016-03-10 14:30:01	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Some people like me that have a busy life during the day can only do big shops a night time and rely on this   the last thing you want to do at 10.00pm is stressing about packing your own shopping ! I would like to say that I will never shop in Tesco again but probably that won t be the case as I only leave around the corner  but in future I would be definitely do my shopping elsewhere and use Tesco as my last option!

I came home today to find a parking charge on my doormat. Apparently I stayed over the allowed time at Walsall tesco?  I didn t even know you had an allowed time  the charge says signs are around? I can safely say they have never been noticed be me!   You want £70 for a 30mins stay and if it s not paid in 14 day £140 what kind of extortion is this tesco? no one s car parking is £280 an hour not even NCP!  worst of it all is I went into walsall tesco and spoke to customer services who were unbelievably rude and very intimidating when I spoke to them. Such a flippant response frome them was just not needed. They even told me they don t own the car park? This car park is under the building no one is that stupid to believe this surly.  It s sad to say but I spend a fortune in your stores I ll be happy to give you my clubcard number to show you. I buy everything because it s convenient from petrol to kids toys tesco made my life easy. I m sad to say I ll never be going again. Sainsburys here I come 😢  Shame on you tesco.					2016-03-09T20:42:12+0000	1457556132	2016-03-09 21:42:12	0	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The first pack was absolutely rancid. It stank. The smell was revolting. I am a chef and noticed straight away. Maybe someone else would not have noticed and eaten them. They would have been very ill.  I defrosted the other pack today. I was dubious about this pack. When I opened them they were the same. Really not good. I had to go out and get something else for dinner.  Again not good  a mile walk to the nearest supermarket  another mile walk home. After a day at work I wasn t happen I had to go back out. I complained before and was given a £5 gift card! If I was a pensioner and eaten those I d have been quite sick. To offer a fiver for something so rancid is a joke.  I was told that was more than tesco would normally offer.  When they were brought they went straight into my freezer so it s not like I had them sat around.  I am appalled that two packs can be the same quality. It s bad management in a store to sell items in this state. Poor control of goods.  I am once again disappointed in Tesco.					2016-03-09T19:58:51+0000	1457553531	2016-03-09 20:58:51	0	8	0	0	8	8	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had my grocery booked for delivery on Wednesday last week. Unfortunately I was ill in bed and couldn t get out of bed to answer the door when the driver knocked. I accepted that he would take the shopping away which he did but I certainly didn t expect Tesco to come back later in the day  luckily when my husband was home  and redeliver my order.

Despite being within its use by date and unopened the coconut has gone a strange bright yellow colour in places and we will not be eating it.   I don t have time to go to a store just to get a refund (that s why I shop online) but I think you should be aware of this. I also think there should be a way to request a refund online.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12809802_10156613288260710_1085824151677966301_n.jpg?oh=8a514569867c693191c3b824d27bcbd1&oe=58D61175	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12809802_10156613288260710_1085824151677966301_n.jpg?oh=b6f886493c571f656bbf3a6277b7dc49&oe=59087C78	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156613288260710&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-09T19:43:23+0000	1457552603	2016-03-09 20:43:23	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

All staff I encountered wanted to bend over backwards to help me when my daughter woke up in her pram halfway through my shop & was rather loud (crying in pain due to teething/still being tired).  Kerry in particular was an absolute star. I was mortified  frantically trying to get my essentials to the checkout  paid & out the store to settle my baby when she took the pram from me & walked up and down to try to calm my daughter down & let me get organised. The reassurance from Kerry & lady serving me that they had been there with their children and that we weren t a bother was lovely. Really above and beyond service today in Buckingham!					2016-03-09T19:30:26+0000	1457551826	2016-03-09 20:30:26	33	6	33	1	40	6	5	1	3	0	33	0	0	0	0	0	0

I arrived for my 3.10pm appointment however due to an online booking error as I hadn t realised that I needed to confirm through an email link to verify my booking so  I was not on their system. The staff on duty were very welcoming and tried their best to fit me in between appointments however the customers were arriving for their appointment slots and to save me waiting around a lovely colleague named Leanne very kindly got me a free drink and chocolate bar with a magazine to wait in the cafe until an appointment came free before the 4.50pm slot that I was now booked in. Her personal skills were impecable  she is such a credit to your store and a valuable addition as I believe that she has only just been transferred  from the Blackpool store a week ago. She sought out to ensure that I had a relaxing wait and as a busy mum herself she realised an hour or two away from motherly duties is a luxury. It so happened that somebody didn t turn up for their appointment so I was seen a bit earlier. I had my eye test and purchased my first pair of glasses with the help and encouragement  of Leanne.  I would definitely recommend  Tesco Accrington Opticians for their professionalism and excellent person centred approach to customers. Please can you ensure that this message of appreciation  is relayed back to the store. Thank you and regards  Miss Aimee Smallman					2016-03-09T17:08:30+0000	1457543310	2016-03-09 18:08:30	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have noticed this in its extremity today.  I am a frequent visitor to Sainsburys cafe. However  today I chose to visit the Thetford Tesco branch for my lunch to see what they had on offer.  As you enter the cafe  it seems to have a nice atmosphere  looks clean and seems laid back enough for the casual luncher. Unfortunately  looks can be deceiving. Behind the counter were four of the most sour faced people I have ever met. They looked like they had just been told the Bank Holiday was not being paid  all future Christmasses were cancelled and their favourite puppy had just been hit by a bus. They didnt dare to make eye contact lest I ask them to do something for me and  despite standing there for a good 5 minutes  I was not even welcomed with a  hello  or even a  be with you in a minute  despite my being the only customer there.  The person on the till at least looked me in the eye like a fellow human being and smiled when I d paid for my Chili Con Carne  offered me a cup for my soda and told me my food would be brought to me. She was the cheeriest of the bunch and to be honest had she not have been so welcoming  I would have turned on my heel and left.  When my food arrived  I was taken aback. It looked worse than hot dinners I had mournfully eaten at school. The Chilli Con Carne should ve been called Chilli Sin Carne (Chilli WITHOUT meat.) I mean  to be fair there was a relatively large amount of sauce  but there was nothing that I would call meat in there. Some beans which broke up the monotony of eating a meal someone without teeth could ve swallowed but no actual meat content. There was a lot of spice in there too.....and I eat hot curries but I think the aim of the Chilli Con Carne is that you are still meant to be able to eat the sauce without the insides of your mouth peeling off.  As for the rice? It added as much to the dish as a piece of parsley balanced precariously atop a pan fried venison - but at least the parsley looks good. I have chewed rice cakes that had more moisture than that which was in the rice I was served today.  All in all it was such an underwhelming and disappointing visit that I wont be darkening your door step in the future  choosing instead your more orange cousin for my lunching needs.					2016-03-09T14:18:29+0000	1457533109	2016-03-09 15:18:29	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This tradition consists of popping down to our local Tesco to purchase baked items which have usually been faultless.  However  today s purchase has left us all very hollow. These  fondant filled  cookies have been anything but! Not only is the fondant totally absent  the general flavour of the plain cookie is disappointing. This item was purchased today at 12:30 from your Large Thetford  branch.  Hope you take this feedback on board and we all look forward to your response.

I am starting up a small business making sweet hampers and I purchased some Easter eggs from you knowing they were each 25p cheaper in sainsburys and having faith that the money would come off at the till. After paying i realised the money had not been taken off and I queried it with a member of staff who said it is based on the whole shop and not individual items! What is the point of that? Anyone can shop round several supermarkets and work out that buying different things in different shops is saving money. The whole point of the brand guarantee is so that you can shop with peace of mind knowing that you will never pay more for ANY item and without the hassle of shopping round! Especially when starting a new business profit margin is very important. I am very disappointed in tesco and will not be shopping there anymore. You are misleading people with your brand guarantee banners flooding the stores. 3p saving on a £67 shop is deplorable!!					2016-03-09T11:31:38+0000	1457523098	2016-03-09 12:31:38	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We called Tesco this morning and they were getting hung up on proof of perchase which isn t our objective. We want this item removed until we get into store to show them the garment and then they can recall it. This is rediculous and slightly worrying that dispite these images tesco are reluctant to take a chance all be it for an hour or two and remove these items until we can prove to them that they are dangerously faulty.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12813963_10153580433474315_2486287460155916255_n.jpg?oh=739b0c0912192f129c98b92b62de9a08&oe=58DB78AF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12813963_10153580433474315_2486287460155916255_n.jpg?oh=1eb80122b12233c0198daa65ecc9a295&oe=58D64DA2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153580433474315&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-09T08:52:49+0000	1457513569	2016-03-09 09:52:49	0	13	0	1	14	13	4	9	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I feel the need to share my experience with you as I m very unhappy.  Today I made myself a nice tassimo hot chocolate drink and thought a dunk on some lovely biscuits would top off what was a good morning only to be disgusted that my favourite biscuit was missing and replaced by  shortcake  and a sticker to say this.... could the sticker not have been placed over the bourbon picture?  I feel robbed and very disappointed.  Shortcake is nothing like a bourbon so it s not even second best... there normally 1 of the last left in the tub.. now my kids have eaten all the other chocolate ones I m left to eat the tat..... they know not to touch my bourbon but because there is no bourbon they had the rest of the goodness before I had a peep .. these chocolate fingers I brought yesterday are just as bad as the Shortcake as soon as I dunk it in my chocolate I m left with a plane biscuit.!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12814804_10208521030439935_6699320469177535873_n.jpg?oh=0a30c64d26d7f97e8d0786eca8a872d3&oe=59060D6E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12814804_10208521030439935_6699320469177535873_n.jpg?oh=fb40fb7e3796cd692b7d50f9cf9afe28&oe=58D6B963	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208521030439935&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-09T08:02:08+0000	1457510528	2016-03-09 09:02:08	2	12	2	0	14	8	5	3	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Out of 4 night pumps  2 were coned off and then one had the nozzles padlocked  So all in all out of 4 pumps only ONE is functioning! This is a common thing in West Sussex. In Horsham at the 24hr petrol station a while back all the night pumps were ON but padlocked!! Maybe some retraining? Or some signs at least so customers know?  #farcical	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12801601_10156567309805368_1091217944827698813_n.jpg?oh=11e927b317f1167b65c0ad233feaf328&oe=59170344	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12801601_10156567309805368_1091217944827698813_n.jpg?oh=6f024868b706a6f437da5dcded6f2511&oe=58DC5349	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156567309805368&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-09T01:47:46+0000	1457488066	2016-03-09 02:47:46	7	1	7	0	8	1	1	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday was our first day out as a family with my husband and 3 week old son. Being new to this i figured tesco was a good place to stop for a coffee  croissant  nappy change and feed. I was upset to find zero changing facilities in the toilets. I had to change my newborn on a disposable mat (which I was so glad i had with me) in between the sink area in the ladies. Which was stressful for me and unpleasant I m sure for the other ladies using the toilets.  Baby changing facilities in a store that size would be a welcome addition!

Wanted to exchange my Dulce Gusto machine as it was faulty.    When I was at the service desk I pressed the buzzer for help. I waited for a few minutes and one of the assistants came  completely ignored me used the computer and walked away.  I pressed the buzzer again  again waited for another 5 mins when the same assistant came back.   I explained that the coffee machine was faulty and produced the receipt.  The assistant looked at the receipt  took the the machine out of the box and told me I would have to call the customer service number  because I was out of the change your mind guarantee.  I explained that I hadn t changed my mind  the unit had been faulty for weeks and I was just looking for an exchange. I was told to take it away and call the number.  When I explained I work unsocial hours as I work for the emergency services and it is not easy for me to wait in for things to be collected.  I specifically brought it into store as this was easiest option and I had someone take me as I don t drive and couldn t manage on the bus.  I am very disappointed I would have expected better.  When I eventually agreed to go home and call the number as the assistant could see I wasn t happy with this option I was told you can speak to a manager if you like.  I was soo disappointed with the service and attitude   I packed the coffee machine up myself as the assistant couldn t work out how it all went back in. If she had no intention of exchanging it why on earth did she take everything out of the box.  I did not want to speak to a manager in store as  shouldn t have to  to get a faulty item exchanged.    The machine was purchased just after Christmas 2015 and broke in February 2016.  I have spent a lot of money purchasing pods and accessories for it.  Not impressed Tesco won t be purchasing anything else like this from you!					2016-03-08T21:21:18+0000	1457472078	2016-03-08 22:21:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Google is actually penalizing them in the SERPs because of that. Also  first time in my life to see a supermarket charging for their click and collect service. Why should someone pay for collecting items from your store? Moreover  they have free delivery for a shopping basket that s more than £10  but you have to sign up with Tesco first  and you can only enjoy that free delivery if you sign up for their monthly paid service which costs a xxx/month. Finally  if you want to buy items from different sections from the store  there are separate delivery charges for their delivery  which means the delivery for the items that we needed would cost as much as the items themselves  and these items are not available in our local stores. This experience makes me not want to shop there anymore.					2016-03-08T20:44:24+0000	1457469864	2016-03-08 21:44:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A few months ago (maybe october/november time) we bought a 9 month - 11 year cozy  n  safe car seat from tesco direct  paid for with boost points.  My 22 month old son has now grown out of the harness at the highest setting  but is way too young/small to just be wearing the seatbelt. I have messaged cozy  n  safe through their facebook page and emailed them on their website to see if they can help me (asking can I put the straps over the top of the back of the seat instead of through the top holes? or would that be dangerous? Is there some setting I m missing on how to use it? etc) I had a couple of replies through facebook a week ago promising to phone me and haven t heard anything. I never got a reply from their website.  Can I take the car seat back to Tesco? I don t have the reciept  but I think it should be in my order history on tesco direct. It s not fit for purpose if I now cannot use it until my son is 4 and can use the seat belt!  What can I do? x					2016-03-08T20:27:25+0000	1457468845	2016-03-08 21:27:25	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The office staff have been fantastic and done their best to get in contact with the drivers and the store on both occasions  with no joy. Best they could do was offer a voucher and refund the delivery charge. Dont get me wrong I appreciate the gesture  but I dont want your money  I d like the delivery slot to be honoured as expected.

I explained that I had forgotten due to having to make an emergency appointment for my 1 year old daughter and I was currently waiting to be seen by the doctor  he said it was no problem and to just ring up to rearrange!  No more than 5 minutes late the same man rang me back to say he had rang the office and sorted a later time out for my shopping to be delivered!  I didn t get the chance to thank him properly as I was still in the doctors. (thank you soo much) When the other guy came to deliver my shopping I thanked him for taking on the extra drop and he told me it was no problem at all!  Just like to say what a fab team of delivery drivers you have they are always friendly and helpful!

It s convenient  the parent/child parking is usually right by the store  aisles are spaced out and usually I find everything I need. Thank you.   You could help your customers with young children out even more. Please  please  please  provide trolleys that have child seats with BRAKES.    It s challenging to put your child into the trolley safely when it keeps sliding away. It s hair-raising when the trolley starts to slide into the path of other cars as you try to load your car with either child or groceries.

I have come to your Tesco store at Hamilton Leicester to get a prescription. There is a wait for the medication so I think I will go into your cafe for my dinner. There I m told they are only serving drinks! I find that odd at 6:30pm to have stopped serving food?? So I asked if I can purchase a sandwich in your store and eat in the cafe. To which I m told that wouldn t be allowed??? I find that absolutely ridiculous. Can you explain please?   Yours a very unhappy customer sat in there car right now! Cold! And with my back hurting for which I m waiting for prescription.					2016-03-08T18:54:09+0000	1457463249	2016-03-08 19:54:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been going there every week since Easter eggs first appeared on the shelves in search of dairy free eggs for my two children who both have a milk allergy  but there haven t been any at all.  I asked at customer services today and was told that they probably weren t getting any this year. Last year there were a few different ones to choose from in that store  which is just a couple of minutes walk from my home. The lady at customer services did offer to check stock elsewhere but that isn t much use when getting to other stores is a problem.  I know the Trent Vale store isn t the biggest one around  but surely it could stock at least one free from Easter egg option?!					2016-03-08T18:32:52+0000	1457461972	2016-03-08 19:32:52	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Same branch  same issue and I m not going to give them another chance. WELLS  Somerset  the Fish was OFF - AGAIN! First time it was skate wings and tonight Seabass  both bought and attempted to cook by the useby date. My children have now had sandwiches for dinner  because I only buy what I need  so when my friend arrives for dinner later  it s either sandwiches for her too or I make a dash back to the supermarket  leaving her to baby sit my children. Embarrassing and extremely inconvenient either way. This is an utter disgrace. I d like to know what you are going to do about this? If there is a third time I will just report this branch straight to the local county council health and safety as something is clearly going wrong with stock monitoring/rotation and management.					2016-03-08T17:36:04+0000	1457458564	2016-03-08 18:36:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We left via an emergency exit in front of the tills and as far as I am aware no people were allowed to take their trolleys with them. I couldn t believe that this fire exit used was partially blocked by a long row of parked shopping trolleys which meant it took a lot longer for people to leave. Luckily it was a false alarm because If it was a serious event then shoppers and staff would have got trampled or crushed with a hundred people trying to get out as the trolleys parked created a very narrow space that only one person could get through and these are actually double doors. Attached photo shows people waiting to get back inside. One of the doors had been closed once people were outside and senior staff investigated. The blue sign clearly says not to block this exit so why are staff at this branch leaving trolleys near the door? There must have been at least 50 trolleys to the left of this photo in a long line.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12814456_10154093922732033_949749003375160142_n.jpg?oh=50c4724af94255c34f65605329e749fb&oe=58D5CB36	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12814456_10154093922732033_949749003375160142_n.jpg?oh=3d69affdc47734c915c80057b5f580ff&oe=590F3823	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154093922732033&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-08T17:02:15+0000	1457456535	2016-03-08 18:02:15	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please could you tell me why you are still charging £10.00 for the cans of SMA formula milk?  A few weeks ago SMA changed their can sized from 900g to 800g yet your price has remained the same.  I have contacted SMA regarding this and they inform me that supermarkets set their own prices.  I am happy to forward the email from SMA to yourselves. Also is formula milk part of your brand guarantee? I look forward to hearing from you.  Many thanks					2016-03-08T15:18:15+0000	1457450295	2016-03-08 16:18:15	2	6	2	0	8	6	4	2	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

How on earth can you justify such a hike in price? £1 here or there I could understand but to double it with no prior warning is  quite frankly  disgusting. I ve already spoken to your customer services team so I have heard the  make it fair for everyone  excuse. You need to consider that you re pricing yourselves out of the market and I can t imagine I m your only customer now considering taking my business elsewhere....					2016-03-08T14:16:35+0000	1457446595	2016-03-08 15:16:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She apologised and offered good will and as she said that she said.  I see you eat a lot of pies?  I think she meant it in a different way to say i ve ordered more and wanted to give me credit for that on my next shop. She was mortified by her slip up. Anyway just as well I m not sensitive but I thought staff should be really careful as it could have been much worse.					2016-03-08T14:01:48+0000	1457445708	2016-03-08 15:01:48	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sadly I struggled to park because of the large volume of non disabled customers parking in the blue badge spaces. Unfortunately this is a regular occurrence at this particular store. I have  with other disabled customers  complained numerous times to be told there is nothing they can do! So in effect anyone can park anywhere in your car parks and in any manner. I suffer from a genetic condition and regularly dislocate my joints and also have to use a wheelchair when I have bad days. I need to be nearer to the store. How can you help your disabled customers?

My wife makes a shopping order for  click and collect  on a Friday evening that I collect on Saturday mornings. The chap at your Leyland store is always polite  welcoming and makes the experience a lot better than the hustle and bustle inside a busy store (I m a bloke with not more patience for shops I m afraid 😄). A BIG thank you!					2016-03-08T12:02:50+0000	1457438570	2016-03-08 13:02:50	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

In less than 10 days my Hudl has been collected  repaired and redelivered. It was packaged well and even had a new software update installed on it. The customer service has been fab with regular text updates  a phone call and even the ability to view the parcels delivery status online. Fab service and all for only £59. Much cheaper than buying a new tablet :) 5*					2016-03-08T11:44:13+0000	1457437453	2016-03-08 12:44:13	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

These cost my son £20 and I am shocked at the poor quality.

We are in search of auction items for the evening and would be extremely grateful if you could find anything possible to donate.The four man team are either full amputees or part and between them  have only 3 legs.They will be giving a talk at Henley River & Rowing Museum on Sat 19th March if you wanted to find out more about these heroic ex servicemen.Also you can look on the website @row2recovery.I very much hope you can help and anticipate hearing from you. Thank you  so much for your time. Sharon Brown.

I go most days. I ve a 3 year old and a 6 month old and every single time I go your staff are smoking at the side of the shelter where the trollies are with infant carriers in. It s absolutely disgusting. If that isn t bad enough the trolley parks are always full so these trollies sit outside in the rain because there s no where for them to go once they ve been used. So the seats for the baby are disgustingly filthy with rain and debris from outside. Then when they make there long journey to the trolley park they get covered in the staffs cigarette ash. I don t smoke myself and do not want to subject my young children to cigarette smoke.					2016-03-08T10:46:53+0000	1457434013	2016-03-08 11:46:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At approximately 22:10 this evening a Tesco home delivery van turned up to deliver what I can only presume based on the volume of food was a entire weekly shop however this is completely irrelevant. What is relevant however is where the delivery driver choose to park his heavy van. He parked on a grass verge outside the house he was delivering to. Due too the recent heavy rain when he tried to pull off from the grass verge he became stuck. After a short wait backup arrived (another delivery van) and towed him to safety leaving a VERY large trench dug into the grass verge. I trust the council will be notified and sent to fix the problem created by your very experienced drivers.  Yours sincerely a Waitrose customer.					2016-03-07T23:20:32+0000	1457392832	2016-03-08 00:20:32	2	4	2	1	7	4	4	0	41	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

On this we decided to visit one of you re stores and decided on a pizza but not just any pizza  one we never tried before. We were delighted and excited at the prospect of a meal that we didn t have to reheat in the microwave. We decided on the American style nacho chicken and couldn t wait to get home  arriving home I was quick to preheat the oven to only find that when I opened the pizza they had forgot to add the key ingredient Nachos. I know you never get what s on the picture but to find one nacho that was broken in two and placed on top you can imagine my shock and disappointment. I am absolutely gutted 😭 so now I m stuck with a simple chicken pizza which I could of picked up cheaper 😭😭😭😭	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12804831_10156693148240624_8345509069667913370_n.jpg?oh=bf24fb4e2255a77c8ccc4cc29f1fc2fc&oe=58DBFD00	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12804831_10156693148240624_8345509069667913370_n.jpg?oh=9cc28f05dcd963c042e06b804e570d11&oe=5911EF0D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156693148240624&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-07T23:18:16+0000	1457392696	2016-03-08 00:18:16	0	9	0	0	9	9	4	5	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Another checkout was opened but too late for me as I d already loaded my shopping. I have complained about this for before  it improves then goes downhill again. There were many staff on the shopfloor replenishing shelves- it really needs more multiskilled staff who have the ability (and authority/initiative) to hop on a checkout as needed. Also more management actually on the shopfloor. I hope that the reduction in opening hours means that staff can be deployed better to assist customer service. You ve a great location in LB and potentially a great brand but as the customer you feel at times that you re put last rather than first.					2016-03-07T22:12:22+0000	1457388742	2016-03-07 23:12:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I realise you may not be able to find it as I may have also lost it in the car park or whilst filling up on fuel.  But if by any chance the cleaners find it or someone hands it in I would be very  very grateful for its return.

This device that i can only assume is to vent vapor back into the pump has been fitted in such a way that it has widened the nozzle enough not to fit in the filler pipe of our mg zs or the bmw 540i we had. Only managed to get £7 in by using a fuel can spout. A well known other fuel station has this device fitted but done to a much better standard and fits still. Bit silly?

Do you think you ll also start stocking vegan ice creams like the one from Rice Dream any time soon? After all  you do sell Rice Dream rice milk  and I m sure their ice cream would be a hit  too. It looks so good! I m also positively surprised by the Tesco brand vegan options. The cheeses are not bad at all. I love the soy ones! And the ready meals for vegetarians are great. Well done Tesco!					2016-03-07T18:27:06+0000	1457375226	2016-03-07 19:27:06	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I regularly shop in one of the tesco express shops (Woodside street  Coatbridge  Lanarkshire) and the staff there are excellent. As a wheelchair user  each member of the staff go out of their way to help and assist me with all my needs. They are polite  courteous  cheery and extremely hard working. They all take the time to chat and if I ve not been in the shop for a few days  they always ask  on my return  if I m ok  if I ve been ill etc. We regularly hear of bad customer service  but this is certainly not the case in the Woodside Street shop. Each member of staff are ambassadors for your Company and you should be extremely proud of them. A special mention for the young boy who regularly serves me (unfortunately  I can t remember his name). He is a lovely  cheery young man who goes out of his way to help and nothing is ever too much trouble for him. Congratulations to whoever interviewed and hired the staff here  they did an excellent job and I hope each and everyone of them continue to be there and serve me for a very long time. 👏👏👏👏👏					2016-03-07T18:19:50+0000	1457374790	2016-03-07 19:19:50	27	15	27	6	48	15	7	8	16	0	25	0	0	0	0	0	0

After giving them as gifts  I was informed that one bunch had two flowers that could be salvaged and the other bunch had less than half that could be salvaged.  They looked fine when all wrapped up in cellophane and paper but when opened to put in a vase they were snapped and dead.  I m not very happy about it as they weren t cheap bunches.					2016-03-07T17:56:06+0000	1457373366	2016-03-07 18:56:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Reply  The income I receive in Clubcard points from a failing supermarket was and is being further reduced. Thus I may as well shop at a supermarket that offers lower prices and no points  for example LIDL and Aldi. This results in an overall benefit to me.

Help for hero ester eggs! I have asked a lot of people who are very keen to buy these but still yet like myself haven t been able to get them! Why for such a good cause do these eggs seem very rare? Can you explain why Dumfries and surrounding tescos don t have them? There use to be a space for them but hasn t been many if any on the shelf!! Very disappointing especially for such an amazing cause! And also can you give me a way of how I would go about getting some please!!					2016-03-07T16:19:10+0000	1457367550	2016-03-07 17:19:10	1	16	1	0	17	16	5	11	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Parents dont use these spaces because we are lazy but to allow space for us to take children and babies in car seats out of the car easily and without damaging other vehicles. If the spaces were at the other end of the car park we might actually get to use them instead of all the lazy ********* taking them first! Oh and if you have a car seat in your car but no child with you  that shouldn t give you the right to use them either.

I m currently sitting in Leo valley tesco extra next to ikea in Tottenham. Iv compared to 3 member of staff now about your revolting toilets. There is poo on the floor blocked toilets blocked sinks mold everywhere hand dryers don t work no toilet roll and no one has gone to attend to this 3 of the toilets are blocked and it smells so bad it s making people gag!! Not only this I had 2 member of staff posh in the queue in front of me to use the customer toilet. As I was queuing another lady informed me they have been like this for WEEKS. I think this needs to be addressed.  Thanks					2016-03-07T12:40:20+0000	1457354420	2016-03-07 13:40:20	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our mail redirection for our old address is just about to end and I received a letter from them asking me if I want a credit card - I have Tesco pet insurance but also held a Tesco credit card years ago  so I m not sure which service it originated from. I updated my address in my Tesco/Clubcard online account and with the pet insurance team months ago  so I don t know how (or where) my old address is still on file with Tesco...but I need to get it removed in case anyone at the old address gets hold of future mail and tries to apply for credit in my name.					2016-03-07T12:14:53+0000	1457352893	2016-03-07 13:14:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sometimes when I go shopping I don t have my club card (my bad) instead of me having to take receipts with me to my next shop why not develop an app that can scan the barcode so the points can be added. There is loads of apps that can scan barcodes so I m doubting it would be that hard. What do you think?					2016-03-07T11:02:22+0000	1457348542	2016-03-07 12:02:22	4	7	4	0	11	7	2	5	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

However when said manager answered the call she was quick to shut my partner down on everything he said  coming from another large supermarket previously (Where I ran multiple  fresh departments) I feel I know a lot regarding food health and safety and trading standards/environmental health and also customer service. When he told the manager this wasn t the first or second time and that unfortunately bringing the item back to be replaced wasn t really sufficient the manager proceeded to talk over the top of my partner argue back and then when we mentioned that I knew the policies she hung up  fair enough that s fine  but surely this isn t your standard practice ?  #tesco #tescobad customer service #customerservice #unprofessional.					2016-03-07T00:15:55+0000	1457309755	2016-03-07 01:15:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The shelves were packed with everything but tins..... I asked one of the male managers who was walking past  why this was  and he said  we don t stock it anymore  we have had to make room for other lines  why not try the pouches?  So.... my cat of 18 years  who is used to the tins would have to change his food because you have decided to not stock it any longer... well  no..... I will not change his food  I will change where i shop. You have lost me as a customer.					2016-03-06T18:23:12+0000	1457288592	2016-03-06 19:23:12	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am gluten intolerant so I have no choice but to pay the higher prices for free-from alternatives for many food items. I have been a loyal tesco customer for years but am disgusted to find that you are charging considerably more for some of these items than other stores. One example I can give you is the Genius seeded soft rolls. £1.50 in morrisons (regular price  not special offer)   but the same item will set me back £2.40 in your store! Nearly £1 more per item! I find this immoral and offensive that Tesco are deliberately taking advantage of people who have no choice but to buy these items. Perhaps it is time to switch my loyalties and shop elsewhere!!					2016-03-06T15:53:22+0000	1457279602	2016-03-06 16:53:22	4	7	5	0	12	7	5	2	1	0	4	0	0	1	0	0	0

I had brought a four pint carton of milk  the seem of the carton handle had split and leaked milk everywhere. I have since washed the carpets in the boot 5 times with a carpet cleaner but I am still faced with the stench of stale milk. Is this something that has happened to many others or is this a one off bad carton as far as you are aware?

About a fortnight (possibly longer) ago I bought one that was on your reduced section for  £1 as you were stopping selling them in this store. I went to the checkout and it said item not on file so the very helpful lady asked for a supervisor. The supervisor took the item and passed it to a colleague who was just passing to find a price and she went back to just standing there.  About 10 minutes later (no exaggeration) the colleague handed the item back to the supervisor and the supervisor approached me and asked me where the item was so I told her. I then told her I had bought one before from the store and it was reduced. I said to her it was £1. She looked at me and said it wouldn t possibly be £1 more like  £4 or more. I got awfully embarrassed at this point as people were looking.  She then went on to say she can t sell the item as she wasn t sure on the price.  Which is fine I understand that. What I couldn t understand is why your supervisor for the store needed to embarrass me so much on a busy Sunday morning. I felt like she was accusing me of lying in front of all these people just for the sake of a few quid.   I m not upset I couldn t have the item. Not at all. I m just upset that a member of your staff embarrassed me so much.   The checkout lady who was very helpful and apologetic stated even full price the items were not £4.					2016-03-06T14:53:02+0000	1457275982	2016-03-06 15:53:02	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Disappointingly when I got home I noticed that you do not appear to follow the traditional Italian medium of packaging for transport. I usually purchase pizzas that are packaged in boxes  however I must have neglected this expectation at the time of purchasing this product. I m not sure how I get the pizza out the jar? I was thinking perhaps its a home baking kit  like the Dolmeo kits  with a layer of dough followed by sauce and cheese.   I have decided to further investigate the matter by unsealing the jar by removing the lid  only to find a thick substance brown in colour. What do I do with this? Do I shape this into a pizza and bake at gas mark 5 until the cheese is golden and crispy? I m concerned it wont be ready for my next scheduled lunch at 1300 hours Monday 7th March 2016.

So it s either dropped on the floor and someone s swiped it or it s been taken from my pocket. I m an easy target as I had a big trolley and a baby.  Security wouldn t help at all  couldnt supposedly do anything.  So now I ve left with no shoppijg and an upset baby. No one even tried to help me.

I went into to your stores to use my daughters world book day token yesterday  usually you have a stand at the end of the aisles with the books that can be purchased with the token but I could not see any there   I asked two members of staff and they did not have any idea about the token or where the books would be. Are you not participating in world book day this year? . My daughter was looking forward to using her token and was left very disappointed.   I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks in advance  Ayshea					2016-03-06T08:57:33+0000	1457254653	2016-03-06 09:57:33	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

What do you have to say for yourselves?!I bought a pack of bacon with 7 rashers..OR SO I THOUGHT! As you can see..you lied to us and i now have a sad fiance who as the man of the house has the extra piece of bacon to save arguments.The fact we have 3 each because you only put 6 rashers in makes breakfast slightly awkward.I refuse to give up a rasher as its Mothers day and i deserve it more. He says  I want my bacon!

I didn t quite catch his name  but he is a breath of fresh air. He s in his early 20s  quite built with slick back black hair. We visited this evening about 10pm and it makes a refreshing change to have such a polite  professional young man working their. Just finished a hard day at work  so I probably had a face like a slapped back side. But he was so friendly. He even packed our bags to precision. To top it all off  he wished us a good night. Now this day in age  it s very rare to receive such fabulous customer service from a younger staff member  especially on a Saturday evening. I hope you can find him so he can see this. He deserves the recognition and maybe a pint or two.					2016-03-05T23:00:04+0000	1457218804	2016-03-06 00:00:04	1	3	1	0	4	3	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Received an email saying it would be in the Alloa store today after 3pm. I went to store at 6pm but it wasn t there as all the click and collect deliveries for Alloa had been sent to Gatwick!! I don t think you could have delivered it any further away if you tried. You didn t even send out a notification to say the delivery had been messed up and I still don t know when it will be delivered!! Very disappointed and so will my mum be now too ☹️					2016-03-05T20:59:39+0000	1457211579	2016-03-05 21:59:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was finally delivered on the Monday.  I actually was so despondent with the level of service from Tesco that I vowed never to use you again.  However  after conversations with the Manager at the Hanley Branch and reassurances from  yourselves  plus I was extremely pleased with the products when they eventually came and the amount of shelf life on  them (I feared I would get items nearing there sell by date  which most definitely was not the case) I agreed to give the online shopping another chance.  Today I have my order  arriving between 8pm and 9pm...  Ready for me to  begin cooking for Mothers Day first thing.   Guess what?  I have just received a telephone call from the Tesco Hanley Branch to inform me that they are very sorry but they have missed off and forgot to load items from my order...  mainly the chilled  which included the chicken and many other items for my planned mothers day meal!!!  They cannot sort it tonight now but will TRY to get  it to me tomorrow  hopefully 2pm!!!! What is going on please?  Another Sunday and plans ruined courtesy of Tesco.   It really is not fair  or ok.   I feel so frustrated with your service and absolutely silly for giving Tesco another chance only to have the same mistakes made at cost to me and my family.  I really feel that there needs to be a review of the online shopping within the Hanley Branch and I would like to know how this mistake has happened yet again.  I am also aware that  I was not the only person last week to not receive their shopping.  I was informed there were 12.  Incredibly shoddy practice.					2016-03-05T20:52:42+0000	1457211162	2016-03-05 21:52:42	4	12	4	0	16	12	4	8	5	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tracked my delivery which should have been here between 2-4pm to be phoned at 6.35 to say that my delivery the next in line would not be delivered because it is too dark. I am absolutely disgusted with the service I have received. I am now without any furniture to sit on over the weekend and just got told phone up to rearrange. To add to this the delivery van has to pretty much drive past my village on the way back to the depot.   This now means that when you do bother to try to re-deliver. I have to give 7 days notice of any time off  which will also be unpaid so now I will be left with no sofa for over a week and the prospect of not being paid to wait in for you.					2016-03-05T19:25:34+0000	1457205934	2016-03-05 20:25:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I explained to you that I have only been buying these in bulk every few days for the  2 banana flavour yoghurts in the 6 pack as it is the only food that my autistic 6 year old will eat and sadly as I discovered yesterday you have discontinued this flavour. I had 27x6 packs delivered and when I phoned yesterday I was told that a delivery driver would pick them all up today as obviously my son will not eat them now. So I was told I would get a phone call to let me know roughly what time this would be. I have kept them all in the fridge ready to be collected and returned and my money refunded. So I have been waiting on this all day and no phone call or Tesco delivery van have come to pick them up as I was assured would happen. Fortunately for me after buying several brands and flavours of yoghurt in the hope my child will eat one he has picked up on Sainsbury s cherry yoghurt which he used to eat but dropped. I have to go out tomorrow and buy Sainsbury s entire stock from my local store which fortunately for me is in the town I live. I therefore will be needing the room in my fridge and now am going to have to bin  the £27 worth of yoghurt that you were supposed to have picked up today and am therefore £27 out of pocket so thanks for that. Every little helps? I don t think so:					2016-03-05T18:37:10+0000	1457203030	2016-03-05 19:37:10	1	6	1	0	7	6	1	5	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Looked online this morning for a throw- found the perfect one for £9.20. There was a prompt to check local store stock- and lucky for me (so I thought it was available.) So I drove across town to get the throw to find it was £20-when I checked with customer service they advised I would have to click and collect to get it for that price. So not only did I waste my time and petrol I ve had to pay an extra £2 delivery to have to go back on Monday to collect the throw I had in my hand!!!!!

After checking to see that the magazine was inside (which I always do before purchase) none of them had the magazine inside. Despite the newspapers had been placed in their appropriate nobody had been aware of this. This is the second time in 4 weeks this has occurred. The suppiler doesn t make any effort whatsoever to mention this to the staff so that a notice is put up for customers awareness and avoids frustration.					2016-03-05T15:39:33+0000	1457192373	2016-03-05 16:39:33	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There are lots of teenagers at the end of each till asking do you need help with packing with a begging bucket taking up valuable space in the end of the till where shopping goes to be bagged.  You say no and they just stand there at the end of the till making it impossible to easily get things in your bags and then into your trolley and leave you in a situation where you have to angle your trolley at some insane angle totally blocking everyone’s easy route to pass you as they have concluded their business with you  I ended up asking the one in my way to move.  The  little helpers  then spend the next 5 minutes gazing at you awkwardly as you try and pack.  Finally after managing to pack my items and pay I am then onto the next frustrating part of the shopping experience.  The checkout operator proceeds’ to waste mine and every other customers time (I literally heard someone call a code RED which I think meant the tills were getting slammed at the time) explaining your Tesco brand guarantee and scribbling a circle around the fact that I had saved £2.33 over your competitors  she seemed surprised I had not seen the ads (I do not watch TV) but thought it an appropriate use of everyone’s time to get onto that topic for a moment.  Then she asked if I wished to take a customer survey online to gain a chance to win something (I had pretty much lost the will to live at this point and stopped listening to her).  Then after all this she then proceeded to wave this bucket of red tokens at me as a final try to waste even more of mine and everyone else s time and I really have no idea what she was going on about at that point as I had lost my final bit of ability to stay polite and just turned around and walked away.  I am not quite sure what your motto of Every Little Helps means exactly but every little bit of your customers time is important.  We want to purchase goods and leave  not get dragged into insanity at your checkouts!					2016-03-05T15:37:59+0000	1457192279	2016-03-05 16:37:59	0	1	0	1	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I got home i went to open the box and realised the BB date was 28.1.2016. I was working the next two days so was unable to return item to store until yesterday (4.3.16) when returned I was offered a half apology and my £1.39 back. I would have understood if the BB date had of been up only a few days ago but it was over a month. If the stock isn t rotated on a packet of biscuits  I wouldn t like to think what else isn t stock rotated. I m extremely unhappy about how the issue was dealt with and I wasn t even assured that the shelves would be checked for anymore out of date items. If you could get back to me on that matter  that would be great  thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/10322802_1228343083861255_2795353571261975841_n.jpg?oh=828bbb1dfd9eaa34ffc13c44a9da4933&oe=5913B926	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10322802_1228343083861255_2795353571261975841_n.jpg?oh=1c2fa320b63df934eb98513aa5074bdd&oe=58D89E33	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1228343083861255&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-05T15:31:01+0000	1457191861	2016-03-05 16:31:01	9	7	9	0	16	7	5	2	8	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

Coupons printed by your own tills too?  I was so frustrated this morning when I presented the cashier with a voucherfor Nappies  and asked if she could scan it to see if it goes through. First she said it will  but when I asked her to double check because they were pull up pants  she changed her mind and out right refused to scan the coupon to check for me.  She insisted the coupon would not work because I had pants and the coupon said  Nappies .  I kept asking her if she could just try to scan the coupon to see if it works  then finally she turned around to discuss it with the cashier behind her  in her own language.  It seems because that cashier told her to give it a try  she finally decided she actually would.  At this point I was ready to move all my shopping and find the manager if she wasn t going to scan this coupon.  In the end the coupon went through and she didn t even apologise for making a big deal out it for 5 mins   what would have been the harm in just trying?  This isn t the first time I ve had problems with your staff being stingy with money off vouchers so i just wonder if this is something you make them do  like avoid using them if there are variations with words to trick your customers or something?? Really takes the mick especially as I go there often to find products discontinued or out of stock.  Rude.					2016-03-05T15:17:33+0000	1457191053	2016-03-05 16:17:33	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A few months ago I bought a packet of pens (Staedtler Triplus Fineliners  10 Pack) that were secured by a safety alarm of which I was not aware of. Arriving home I placed my pens into the drawer  forgetting about them in the meantime. Coming across these pens again just recently  I realized I could not open them and returned to the store last night at around 8 pm  in which I had purchased them. Upon arrival I immediately approached the security guard (named something like Apher) explaining my situation. He then tricked me into giving him the packet  claiming I had stolen them. He would not give them back to me. I was angered and asked him to call the manager (Charmaine). She told me that unless I had a receipt  I could not get my pens back  also implying that I had stolen them. Now I am left with no pens  no receipt and no proof at all. The manager was not willing to understand my situation  nor engaged me regardless of the situation having occurred due to an initial mistake by an employee  who did not remove the safety strip in the first place. Afterwards she merely dismissed me  claiming she had another customer to attend to.  I am angered due to the fact that my pens were taken from me and that I was accused of being a thief. The company has no right to confiscate my pens without any proof of me having stolen them (which I would like to stress that I did not)  or even without any proof that I purchased them from Tesco. I demand that the pens I have paid for are returned to me. And that the employees at the Hackney store are briefed about the presumption of innocence and their legal rights to confiscate items from customers.					2016-03-05T14:05:18+0000	1457186718	2016-03-05 15:05:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yes  they said. That was three weeks ago. Still no sign of my flier on the community noticeboard.  Why? Am I not a member of the community? And don t tell me it s for charity events only. Line-dancing isn t a funding event  nor Slimming World. Why not something that says  Hey  shoppers  aren t you aware of the local talent?					2016-03-05T14:02:25+0000	1457186545	2016-03-05 15:02:25	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have had the same issue with a product being out of date since October 2015. The product in question is walkers spicy mix ups. Practically every week since last October I would go in to the leatherhead store and find at least one bag out of date. Today I went in to store and found 11 bags out of day with the oldest being 12/12/2015!!!!!!!!!!  Each week I would take the out of date crisps off the shelf and hand them to a member of staff to make them aware. So two weeks ago I thought that this was not getting resolved in store so called up the help line hoping this would get this resolved. Finally speaking with the store manager of the leatherhead store today  she had not been informed of any complaint nor had she been informed of a problem from any of her management team. I have seriously lost all confidence with this company and if anyone wanted to complain to the customer services helpline  most likely you will be made to feel that it s a product issue and not a staff issue as this would be because if it was a staff issue  it would give the true complaints figures for the company. I then mentioned today to the telephone customer services manager (Gareth) that I could post something on social media to make other people aware of the issue and he said there is nothing to stop you doing that so here is my post. Please check your product dates when buying stuff in store as Tesco will not refund you if you take the product back to store. The only positive is that a telephone customer service manager Gareth seemed to understand and true to his word did investigate and called me back as promised. Time will tell if this get resolved. Confidence has certainly been lost with this company!					2016-03-05T13:17:24+0000	1457183844	2016-03-05 14:17:24	3	4	3	1	8	4	3	1	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I shop at Slough  Taplow and online  I have 3 phone contracts with you  2 hudls  and earn a huge number of clubcard vouchers per annum and I have never recieved anything like this nonsense that I have had this morning.  I will not pay a  charge  for being able to shop in your store and I request that you make contact with me and this ridiculous matter be put to a stop immediately.					2016-03-05T11:35:45+0000	1457177745	2016-03-05 12:35:45	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered it a week ago and to do click and collect. Last night I decided that I could pick the food up earlier than first arranged so changed by time not knowing this would affect my order at all as I was changing time not day. On completion and receiving my email I found the party food removed. On contacting what u call customer services I was told yes it had gone off the system  nothing could be done and that s because u need 6 days notice to order the food and because i had changed the time it had taken it off as its then a new order. Although I had the same order number. I did point out if I had been told this by the system before completing I would never of changed. Now 24hrs to party and I need to try and sort out food that I don t have time to make.					2016-03-05T08:39:05+0000	1457167145	2016-03-05 09:39:05	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having had the Fridge-Freezer delivered  it was immediately apparent that the item was not as expected. It was smaller than imagined and not fit for a family  despite being advertised as a family fridge-freezer. With only two shelves  it would not be suitable for our needs.   Thinking this would be fine  as I had purchased online and knew I had 14 days in which to return an item  I called Tesco.   I was told that I had purchased via a third party being Appliances Direct and given their number. So  I called them.   They informed me that I did have 14 days to return the item  but would have to do so at my own cost and they were based in Derby or Huddersfield! Having obtained courier quotes (most commercial couriers won t take kitchen appliances  as I found out!)  we were shocked to find that it was going to cost £140 to return the Fridge-Freezer!!!!   Obviously  we have to purchase a new Fridge-Freezer  and do not have an additional £140. At no time in the purchase of the Fridge-Freezer through your website was it made clear that any return would be at our expense.   We are a hard-working family and feel we have been treated wholly unfair and are now out of pocket by a considerable amount. This is not a great reflection upon my opinion of Tesco!					2016-03-05T08:12:40+0000	1457165560	2016-03-05 09:12:40	3	26	3	0	29	26	10	16	8	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was really excited as he skipped to the till with his toy. The lady scanned it a few times and then said we couldn t buy it as it wasn t on file..  I checked with customer services and they said the same. It broke his little heart. He cried his little eyes out and not in a bratty kicking off way  in a really heartbroken way. Are no checks done when things are put on the shelves to make sure you can actually buy them???					2016-03-05T07:45:08+0000	1457163908	2016-03-05 08:45:08	2	8	2	0	10	8	4	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am very unhappy with your home delivery service yet again.  They constantly turn up very early and unload their vehicle before knocking on our door half hour early some weeks. As we have a baby this is not convenient. Neither is the fact that they could not find a convenient subtitution for some vegetables today. We usually buy pre chopped bags  carrots  broccoli  cabbage and a mixed bag. Today I received 1 whole broccoli to last a family for a week. How is there no loose carrots as a substitute for example. I now have to drag my baby to the shops which defeats the object of home delivery!  Not happy with this service yet again and I would like to see this sorted. Either the store has very very poor stock or the staff are useless!					2016-03-04T21:15:07+0000	1457126107	2016-03-04 22:15:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In Tesco Fulbourn today I was told I could not purchase a bottle of wine for my friends birthday because of scars on my arm. I am working hard on my mental health and to hear this (and loudly in front of the other customers in the queue behind me) is not only negative towards my progress  but triggering  and also highly humiliating. The woman said that it was  company policy  to refuse to serve alcohol to people with scars on their arms. I have now been informed this is not actually company policy at all  but no manager would come out to speak to me and this was the impression I was left under.  My personal history and mental health should not be speculated upon when I do my weekly shop. Tesco  please train your staff.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12799257_10153944045834817_6484265374267133350_n.jpg?oh=b08d617208a7a9159720aaff482b2e4b&oe=5912BA7C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12799257_10153944045834817_6484265374267133350_n.jpg?oh=762f95f0401ff4349e876ffba432ca21&oe=591F5D71	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153944045834817&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-04T21:12:45+0000	1457125965	2016-03-04 22:12:45	4296	999	5252	2012	8263	946	481	465	6255	0	4186	9	29	2	151	734	0

Went in yesterday morning (3.3.16) after a night shift to buy bread etc  having watched staff loading the bays with loaves one might be forgiven for expecting it to be  fresh  bread. No such luck have noticed the  fresh  bread I bought in the morning had a BB date of - you ve guessed it 3rd March - in other words the bread was already stale before it was actually put out for people to buy. Not happy  I don t use bread that quickly and there is only so much toast that can be eaten.

I knew it would be cheaper than your competitors on the whole trolley price as I am a savvy shopper and bought a lot of deals. It was £6.00 cheaper and so nothing came off at the till.  During our shop my husband picked up some carte noire decaff coffee which was £3.90 in your shop and £2.50 in Asda (can t quite understand that price difference) but I said  its ok there is a price guarantee . When i asked why the price wasn t matched on the receipt a manager said  because its overall £6.00 cheaper  and i said but it should be another £1.40 cheaper. she tried to flumax me with an explanation of the total price being cheaper. But I am not sure why you are advertising a brand match when you are not brand matching. She said  you are the only customers that don t understand this  whilst smiling.  Confused just because i shopped smartly does that mean i can be ripped off on coffee?					2016-03-04T20:44:10+0000	1457124250	2016-03-04 21:44:10	4	29	4	0	33	29	11	18	11	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst looking at cards  we spotted a balloon with the words  best mum ever!!  After having a discussion with the duty manager  Katherine Rhodes  about how long the balloon would last  and explaining about her funeral on Tuesday  she said it would likely last another week. Me and Arron wondered off to look at more cards  when Katherine came over to us  tapped us on the shoulder with the balloon in her hand as said we could have it free of charge and that she was sorry for our loss. To say I broke my heart is an understatement!! Just them two sentences alone was more than enough to restore my faith in humanity. I just wanted to say a massive thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your kind actions at an extremely difficult time. And also a very big thank you to Sharon on the shop floor who spoke to us both for 5 minutes  telling us how sorry she was for our loss. Tesco extra Huddersfield road..... You really did go that extra mile!!! Thank you again from Arron and myself xxxxxx					2016-03-04T20:36:37+0000	1457123797	2016-03-04 21:36:37	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ended up not eating anything we bought from there and Tbh we re disgusted  someone obviously is making them with their hair down or something!!

Up until now I have always been impressed with the quick  easy service. However  last month I ordered a substantial delivery  only to find items missing! I noticed a couple  so asked the driver  who claimed they were not in his van! After unpacking  I also discovered numerous other items missing. I appreciate you refund these missing items. However it is still very frustrating  when you really need them!  Tonight  I expected a delivery between 6&7. I am still waiting at nearly 8 o clock!! Surprise surprise  customer service have no answer & can t get hold of driver!!   What s the point in booking a time slot  if you can t keep to it!

I took my two boys to the cafe for their dinner  we was served by very friendly staff  one of the staff in particular was AMAZING!! Her name was Rebecca  she managed to get a conversation out of my eldest son who has autism  she persuaded him to draw a picture for the kitchen. He did such a great picture for her that she then gave him and his brother a doughnut each. He was so happy and it made his day. She is a fantastic person and a credit to the store. 👏🏻😊					2016-03-04T19:46:57+0000	1457120817	2016-03-04 20:46:57	19	2	19	1	22	2	1	1	3	0	18	0	0	0	0	0	0

I make a minimum of 4 visits a week to this store. I work in retail and I am aware of the pressure put on members of staff. Working in retail I am aware it is clear that customer experience is what increases customer loyalty. Unfortunately  it seems as though customer experience is not a high priority within this store. I often use the tobacco kiosk within the store  I spend a minimum of 15 minutes waiting to be served. There is a clear lack of communication within the store as there is only ever 1 member of staff on the kiosk  I have been in the store with 20 people waiting to be served at the kiosk and there has never been a member of staff to support the kiosk  it is evident the store is run in departments and not everyone is trained or employed to work on this area however  if it is that there is only one person capable to process the tills on this area within the whole store at one time then this is a serious issue within a large store that senior management should be extremely disappointed in. It is an area where customer service is vital which has been let down on many points.   On the 04/03/2016  I came to the store with my sister and her two year old child and 8 week old child. With a distressed and hungry 8 week old child we wanted an easy shopping experience which is something I would expect from Tesco. I needed to purchase a few items (bottled drink x2  cocktail sausages  chicken bites  cigarettes). My sister needed two packs of Huggies pull ups and Cow and Gate baby formula. As I needed to purchases cigarettes and we both had less than 10 items (which is stated in an unprofessional  poorly made  hidden sign above the kiosk) for convenience we thought it would be easier and quicker if we both completed our transactions at the tobacco kiosk. We waited patiently in the line as it continued to grow to a minimum of ten people. As the lady in front completed her transaction the member of staff (Ginny) proceeded to continue her conversation with the customer  stating her unhappiness with the company and her dislike to her job. I was eventually served  the member of staff did not engage in conversation with me nor was I offered a carrier bag  my items were rushed through the till. As my sister stepped forward to purchase her 3 times  the member of staff made a negative comment in a negative tone  you two are sneaky  this was completely unnecessary  after my sister asked what the member of staff implied by her comment she repeated her previous comment  that was just sneaky . I was completely disgusted that she felt  it was acceptable to make this comment in front of a two year old who was very aware of the dynamic and atmosphere.   On a previous occasion  involving the same member of staff. I entered the store at 06:50 am  Ginny told me she could not serve me until 07:00 am  I had no problem with this. I stood and waited  Ginny then engaged in a conversation with another member of staff. At 07:00 I waited as she continued her conversation  I did not want to be rude so I continued to wait. At 07:08 I asked if she would serve me I was told it was not 07:00  when I told her the time she pulled a face and rushed through my transaction.   I am thoroughly disappointed with repeatedly receiving poor customer service within the store. I have previously not mentioned the poor quality of customer service that I have received as I am aware of what happens within stores  however  as this is something that repeatedly occurs it needs to be addressed.					2016-03-04T18:02:00+0000	1457114520	2016-03-04 19:02:00	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

To say I was disappointed is an understatement! The left photo was taken before her cut.. the right one is after her cut. And I was insultingly charged £9.50!!! The girl who did the cut said she had taken an inch off and tidied it up... no she hasn t. .. she has snipped at it and done her fringe which I could have done myself... maybe if the staff paid as much attention to paying customers instead of dying each others hairs and getting ready for their Friday night out then my daughter may have got a haircut worthy of the £9.50 price tag!!!! I asked for it to be thinned out... this hasn t been done... I would have complained to the manager but she was too busy having  her hair dye washed off.... absolute bloody joke!!!!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12832465_10208450696366887_4821535994901684354_n.jpg?oh=398a4f935dbaef823a974eb2dced89f9&oe=5917FA6F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12832465_10208450696366887_4821535994901684354_n.jpg?oh=9f34ee294ada9832451b582a69ae67af&oe=591E6662	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208450696366887&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-04T17:21:48+0000	1457112108	2016-03-04 18:21:48	2	21	2	0	23	20	10	10	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Money is going to either of 2 projects in Lowestoft or 1 in Ipswich (not at all local to Beccles)  both of which have their own Tesco stores. Surely a local cause would be better? I m sure my oldest child s school would welcome help for the school to help fund trips  books and equipment.					2016-03-04T16:35:26+0000	1457109326	2016-03-04 17:35:26	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently bought a £29.99 mothers day bouquet from  DebenhamsFlowers  and was completely embarrassed and upset by what they delivered. (it looked like the left over  out of date  bruised and battered petrol station flowers of Christmas just gone). I was in an absolute panic (due to breaking my ankle yesterday) and needed something that appealed to my mother - and fast. Your Tesco s team in Kings Lynn had placed out the most amazing display of mothers day flowers and in my time of need  i said to my mother to pick out £20 worth of flowers - to hers and my surprise  we ended up with 6 extremely large bunches of flowers - and i have never been happier to see her face beam with the glee of having so many flowers in her house. On my mothers behalf and on mine - i would like to say a HUGE thank you... you seriously helped me save face  and kept me in the good books with my mum.

My daughter was bundled up in the buggy  full of cold  and the man who was re-stocking the bananas pointed out the free fruit for children (fab idea!) and he asked if she would like somthing. She didn t today as she s not feeling 100% but how nice it was for him to offer. After a bit more shopping  and a lot more in my basket than I went in for  another male member of staff said  excuse me  then  I just needed to put that down as it was heavy  I replied  No probelm  I know the feeling!  To which he replied  Do you heed any help? . Bless him! It s not everyday you struggle with a buggy and a full basket and a member of supermarket staff actually offer to help. Finally  at the till  after the offers had come off  I was 17p short of being able to use my money off coupon  and it was no trouble for the boy on the till to let me quickly get something else. It s not just money off that keeps customers happy  it s the friendly staff like the ones we saw today. Thanks Tesco! :)					2016-03-04T14:05:49+0000	1457100349	2016-03-04 15:05:49	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I must have been 5 mins late home from the school run and he had been and gone. I phoned up at 11 to ask where my delivery was and was told they had already been but noone was in but would be back out to me in 20 minutes. When he arrived he straight away started on me that he had knocked and I wasn t in and was shouting at me.

Neither my name  what store or what product despite advising them it was a piece of silver. Told to take back to store to fill in a form. Surely you should be taking details over the phone so there is a log of when this  happened. Normally wouldn t bother ringing but I thought as it was a hard silver piece it might not be the only one.

In particular today Penny was so nice to me   we got to her till and just as I started to put the shopping through the my daughter decided she needed the toilet (3yr old timing!!) I had my son on the top of the trolley in his car seat and all the shopping to sort out  Penny very kindly watched him for me whilst I ran my daughter to the toilet and by the time I got back she had put all the shopping up onto the conveyer belt from my trolley for me and was chatting away to Oliver keeping him happy. It s little things like this that really do help and are so so appreciated and I think it s important to say thank you and give recognition to people who go out of their way like this for others so thank you Penny!

Get either £9 or £6 off a £60 spend. I can t remember the last time I spent £60 in any supermarket in one spend. If Tesco were to send me coupons with either £3 or £2 off a £20 spend I would be much more interested and would use the coupons. As usual I have filed the coupons that have arrived in the recycling bin.					2016-03-04T09:44:49+0000	1457084689	2016-03-04 10:44:49	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Charlie is a 13 year old moggy who enjoys the finer things in life  as well as yowling and following me around the house. One of the finer things which Charlie enjoys is his food. He will yowl and mew until he has been fed  and every time anyone walks into the kitchen...in short  he loves his food. One of the foods he enjoys is the Tesco  Looks so Tasty  range. Now imagine Charlie s disappointment this morning when  upon walking into the kitchen and yowling incessantly at his sleep-deprived-mother-of-a-7-month-old-teething-baby  he realises that he cannot have the sachet that has been lovingly opened for him because the whole sachet is full of gravy and no meat! No cat can live off gravy alone! Charlie realises the end must be nigh and the yowling turns to uncontrollable sobs of hunger and sadness that there may never be food available to him ever again. In a brave move and fortunate turn of events  his mother opens another sachet and low and behold! It s a miracle! There is meat!! Charlie sniffs at the food suspiciously  takes his usual 4 mouthfuls and disappears off to steal some poor unsuspecting neighbours defrosting sausages.  It s is going to take some time to build Charlie s trust in your food again  and he wanted me to convey his disappointment and hope that this will not happen to any other cats in the future who may not have the psychological strength to deal with this near death experience.  Kind Regards   Emma  and Charlie  #justiceforcharlie #catscannotliveongravy	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12804681_10153931942328638_6724084970646596285_n.jpg?oh=a094c8a905d4f8d4a40074ff5de4dbba&oe=591A55EF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/12804681_10153931942328638_6724084970646596285_n.jpg?oh=62b581d475cd5ae69939858816fd50c9&oe=590D22FC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153931942328638&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-04T08:05:45+0000	1457078745	2016-03-04 09:05:45	28	18	34	6	58	18	8	10	11	0	28	0	0	5	0	0	0

Has to be the quickest and most efficient service I ve ever received. I bought a tesco microwave in may last year. It has already stopped working after less than a year so I sent an email just quickly stating the problem and that I have an email somewhere with the order number. I sent it in the evening and wasn t expecting a call back for a few days. Literally within two minutes they rang my house phone and somehow had already pulled all my order details up and arranged for a new microwave to be collected from my local store. I was absolutely amazed. Thankyou! 👍😀					2016-03-04T08:01:00+0000	1457078460	2016-03-04 09:01:00	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just been delivered my Tesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurt 6X125g which since last week have changed from a German nice tasting fresh not too sweet yogurt to a British gloopy over sweet product with bad aftertaste.  Is it too difficult to product test a change like this.					2016-03-03T22:23:36+0000	1457043816	2016-03-03 23:23:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have to say your customer service is amazing when you’re selling your products its first class couldn t be more helpful. My complaint is the aftercare I’ve received....  I purchased a Samsung S6 champagne gold online on the 16/01/16 came within the week I couldn’t wait to use it although because I spent all that money on it I thought I’d invest in an otter box defender case  as I had to wait for my case to be delivered my new phone sat in the box as I wouldn’t trust myself with a phone that cost me £399.97.   Once I got my cover the phone came out of the box and I couldn’t have been happier with it up until a week ago when my phone started to freeze and not respond then decided to switch itself off and not come back on.  Tonight I rang you’re company asking for advice and was told it shouldn’t have gone like that and to take it to a local store and would be given a replacement  so I got in my car and took the phone over to one of your branches at Knoocknagoney  Co Down Northern Ireland… this is when my opinion of Tesco changed. I explained the situation to one of your colleagues and he rang you’re support team on advice of what to do  once on the phone it was explained and I got an absolutely ridiculous solution to the situation. I was told that there is nothing you could do for me  I wouldn’t be getting a new phone in replacement of the broken one  I wouldn’t be getting my money back  instead I would have to send it to your repair shop to get it repair which would take 2-3 working days for a package to be delivered to me that I put my phone into and return it to yourselves to be fixed which would take 10 days  then I would have to wait for the phone to be returned. This isn’t good enough the phone is less than 2 months hasn’t been used from the date I collected it.  I spent my hard earned money on a phone that doesn’t work correctly  I can’t get an exchange  I’m not entitled to my money back to go and buy a new phone  I now have to wait days on this box getting to me.  Then go for 2-3 weeks without a phone…  I need my phone for work. When I asked about a replacement phone the lady from your company said “use an old one  there is nothing we can do” if my old phone was functioning I wouldn’t have spent all that money in the first place and I wouldn’t be in this predicament.  To say I’m fuming is an understatement  absolute disgrace spending all that money on a phone and knowing that if I get the phone back from repairs it will be a refurbished phone that wasn’t working for someone else so in fact I’m getting a second hand phone in replacement for a phone used for 4 weeks!  Future reference I won’t be buying another phone from yourselves neither will my family and friends and I hope that this is read by other customers and is taken as a warning that if your phone stops working after 14 days of purchase you might as well have thrown your money away… next time you need a new phone go see Apple. The most unhelpful  disappointing  disgusting  time wasting customer service I have ever received.   Regards  Tamsin  A very unhappy customer.					2016-03-03T21:38:28+0000	1457041108	2016-03-03 22:38:28	53	15	56	13	84	15	10	5	5	0	52	0	0	0	0	3	0

Nelly had gone into gut statis which is bad for bunnies. Turned out she had tucked into some cat biscuits! I just went in for milk and Annabelle was working on till.

I was called forward with my items so I passed the items to the server Stephen and he started a conversation the customer to my right...he didn t ask if I wanted a bag but speaking to the other man he filled the bag with my items.  The other customer had then been served by someone else and was leaving shop still talking to staff member serving me. I bleeped my own clubcard as I was not spoken to I entered my card details and forgot I needed another item. Whilst I was still standing there waiting to ask him could I have batteries he still carried on speaking to this other customer that was leaving. I said excuse me but are you serving me? What s with the attitude he said to me... you had attitude as soon as you got here.. I said excuse me? I said you called next person and I walked up with my items  you never asked if I wanted a bag you spoke to that fella and did not once ask me anything or give me eye contact so how could I of given you attitude. I am reporting you to head office I said.. go head was his reply. I can speak to who I want.. he was VERY argumentative and I am DISGUSTED!					2016-03-03T18:52:46+0000	1457031166	2016-03-03 19:52:46	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I directed her to your website and she was very happy to see your free clubcard points offer and I explained to her that she could use them to buy lots of bonios for me (well after all  it was my idea to get pet insurance  so it’s only fair!)

My daughter bought this sandwich from the Tesco petrol station in Winchester yesterday (2nd of March). Thank god she doesn t like tomatos because if she hadn t have opened the sandwich to remove them she would have eaten this disgusting mould which can be seen in the photo and on other areas of the sandwich. Not much in a way of an apology when taken back to the store  at the end of the day and this left her without any lunch before a full college afternoon as she did not have time to go back again in her lunch hour😕 I suggest someone looks at the cooling units in the store so this doesn t happen again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12806233_493383240847795_5891376202558436564_n.jpg?oh=a4e6687dbf0e922c7d68c285eef15cfc&oe=590E24E4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12806233_493383240847795_5891376202558436564_n.jpg?oh=afcacd17adf5cbaa36979614fddeb1b5&oe=59168A1B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=493383240847795&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-03T17:58:36+0000	1457027916	2016-03-03 18:58:36	1	12	5	0	17	12	8	4	6	0	1	0	2	0	0	2	0

There looks to be no space available for it either.  This was in aisle 17.  There are bottles of flavoured Volvic  but that is not what I want.  I had to buy Buxton again.  Is there some conflict with the suppliers of Volvic then?					2016-03-03T17:46:09+0000	1457027169	2016-03-03 18:46:09	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Managed to fix the first problem on my own which was the  connection is not private  issue. But now I ve sorted that out  I have a blue screen on death invading my laptop every 30 mins or so telling me  Bad_Pool_Caller  I asked Tesco they said phone Acer  I phoned Acer  other than being bloody rude  they said contact Tesco. I m sick of being sent to the other one. All I want is a refund on the faulty product I received. I am so angry writing this. I have always shopped at Tesco. I ll send you my clubcard information to disclose how much I have spent in the years I ve been shopping here. I promise if this isnt sorted I wont be shopping here again. Please will someone just allow me to bring the product back to store for a full refund. I m not asking for too much.					2016-03-03T17:26:47+0000	1457026007	2016-03-03 18:26:47	1	3	1	0	4	3	3	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have bought my milk from Tesco as part of my shopping for years.  However  on my way home from family on a Sunday I called into a different supermarket to buy extra milk as I knew I woudn t get to my Tesco before it closed.  I couldn t believe the taste in this supermarket s milk as it was much better than Tesco s.  It was a much creamier taste which made Tesco milk taste very watery - so my question is what has happened to Tesco milk... is it being watered down?  I would be interested in a reply to this.					2016-03-03T17:14:50+0000	1457025290	2016-03-03 18:14:50	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Everything seems to be as usual until I reached the cashier with loads of my supplies when I heard that there are no medium  most common plastic #bags at store at all. Sounds like a not big problem  but this is not the first time! I had the same experience twice in City Centre and once at #Douglas  which are two biggest stores in Cork region. So today I bought 4 small bags instead of 2 medium  and in my previous experience I had to buy bags for frozen food and those extra large. Every time I had to buy something that I don t need and had to pay double for it.  As I spotted big enough paper bags sitting at the another counter and ask for those I been told that they are only for customers who buy clothes (?) Since it happen often I can not believe at word  sorry  we are out of bags  as I mentioned  it is about hipermarkets. If you look into the figures and math is seems that district managers pumping up extra sales with that old fashion sales method in 2016  which is dishonest to the customers and makes me ask my self.. What are the Tesco s (Cork) company values? Is that way of making extra profit environment friendly? Thank you for considering my complaint and letting me share this with you					2016-03-03T15:43:28+0000	1457019808	2016-03-03 16:43:28	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter scooted into store and he marched after us and demanded that I give him the scooter. He said that my 4 year old was not allowed to ride her scooter  I said we ve never heard this before after several years of scooting in there...and he replied  I work here now  - I refused to give him the scooter  I had to say I would carry it 3 times before he stopped and walked off.   It s not unreasonable to ask her not to scoot but his manner was extremely rude and verging on aggressive. He walked away and my daughter burst into tears. I saw him by the checkout and told him he d made my daughter cry and he pushed past me and marched towards her. I ran back and blocked him with the scooter and he tried to push past me. I said 5 times  do not go near her  while he pushed to get past me to my daughter...and eventually a cashier left her post to intervene and tell him to leave us alone.   She is 4  not a shop lifter.   sent to Tesco store customer service.					2016-03-03T14:26:41+0000	1457015201	2016-03-03 15:26:41	1	6	1	0	7	5	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I first put them on I thought was great. I threw away the receipt and wore them today. After having them on for about an hour they started to go really loose and baggy. By lunch time I had to go home and change they as they had lost their shape and looked terrible. Am I able to exchange them as they are not fit for purpose?

I have just had my 4th consecutive  random  (sic) check in 4 visits to my local store (which I visit usually once a day). Prior to that  I had many weeks of blissful trouble-free checkouts  but prior to that I had my own personal world record of 10 consecutive  random  checks! (Yes - ten!!!) And that included shopping at a different town 160 miles away!  Statistically  this doesn t appear to be very random  and almost smacks of victimisation! :-)  I have been told to write or contact head office  using the details on the paper they give you at Customer Service helpdesk  but I have emailed  phoned and written in the past - all without a single reply  so I don t hold out much hope here?  For the record  previous checks have never revealed any missing un-scanned items  so it can t be that?					2016-03-03T13:11:52+0000	1457010712	2016-03-03 14:11:52	0	17	0	0	17	16	5	11	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered an item at Tesco Direct online and paid for express delivery. Was told it would be delivered on 29th Feb  Nothing came so phoned to be promised it would now be with me on 1st March. Checked tracking (which still says 29th) to see it had not even been sent out. Then got an email on evening of the 1st to say it would be 3rd. Not impressed. Could have got the item for £50 less elsewhere for deliver on 3rd.

Also i mean i do like salad some times but when its green. When i get salad as a side i dont expect the lettecue to be yellow and the onions to be dried out messes. Thank you for showing me why you should never eat in your cafe due to fear of death by chocking on days old chicken.					2016-03-03T12:17:38+0000	1457007458	2016-03-03 13:17:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon inspection of the box  i noticed it was 10 DAYS OUT OF DATE.. 10 DAYS.. so now my brothers birthday is spoiled because he loves thomas.. and you ve helped spoil he s day.. thank you tesco for making me the worst brother in the world.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12321591_10153449599950754_6023475573975809445_n.jpg?oh=8a4bae77815319dfc91b55f117827023&oe=592036CB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12321591_10153449599950754_6023475573975809445_n.jpg?oh=0f21ceebc7a0436796fc7ddd28591ad4&oe=592211C6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153449599950754&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-03T10:40:40+0000	1457001640	2016-03-03 11:40:40	40	16	43	1	60	16	8	8	10	0	39	0	0	3	0	0	0

I did not have change so visited your cash point then went in store to change into coins  I would normally remove my helmet when going in store but was only popping in briefly then riding over to your jet wash. When I got to the counter the woman behind the counter was pleasant and exchanged a few words with me whilst forfilling my request. Whilst being served a manager came over and asked me to remove my helmet for safety reasons  I replied  what s the difference between me and someone wearing a burka? .  she replied   they are wearing them due to religious reasons so it s allowed .  My quarm is why is religion a valid excuse to breach store/customer safety?  I consider myself religiously a biker. In my opinion this is blatant discrimination and a breach of my rights as a UK citizen.  I look forward to your reply Regards David James Greensmith	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12798873_10153565681143789_4860710149140919958_n.jpg?oh=a7712c64fda657bbda46ecae7ed38392&oe=58DD59D3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12798873_10153565681143789_4860710149140919958_n.jpg?oh=b3f7f121857e966fb135c9100c34d726&oe=58DBE4DE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153565681143789&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-03T10:35:27+0000	1457001327	2016-03-03 11:35:27	17	18	17	0	35	13	10	3	9	0	17	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last Tuesday I discovered a sharp piece of Perspex - triangular and fairly large in size - in an in-store blueberry muffin which was ordered as part of an online home delivery. This item was in a muffin my five year old son ate; luckily he realised that there was something in his mouth that shouldn t have been. However  I dread to think what would have happened had he swallowed it. I contacted the appropriate departments and can confirm that a gift was sent through with my next home delivery. What I m unhappy about is the promise of calls to update me on this situation - none of which have materialised - and that despite chasing an update myself I have been  in my opinion  fobbed off. This is an extremely serious incident  which could have had unforetold consequences and I naively expected more from Tesco to be honest.  I m contacting you in the hope that this avenue of communication will get me further  and may provide satisfactory answers and a suitable form of apology.					2016-03-03T00:19:26+0000	1456964366	2016-03-03 01:19:26	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I made an order to be delivered today between 9 and 11 PM. it s 11:25 PM  I ve been home since 9 and no truck has arrived  however  when I look online it shows as  delivered . What is going on? I waited up for you and I needed some of the things I bought for tomorrow morning. Did you give my order to someone else and charged me for it? Are you going to re-deliver my items tomorrow (when it s extremely inconvenient)?

I arrived at your Chorley store just before 7pm with my two year old daughter - ALL parent and child spaces were taken which was very surprising considering the time. I waited for a space to come free which was made available by a couple with no children. I parked up  moved round to get my daughter out of the car when another person came back to their car which was also parked in a parent and child space - and guess what ... No child! I confronted your customer who told me to get a life! So I explained (quite loudly) to him why stores make child friendly spaces and also explained it isn t for people like him to park his stupid flashy cars! I think you need to do something about these spaces - I know I speak for all parents these spaces are a god send when you are getting your child in and out of the car. They aren t made so people in flashy cars can park closer to the store! Something needs to be done to stop people parking in these spaces when there is no need for them to be					2016-03-02T23:21:47+0000	1456960907	2016-03-03 00:21:47	2	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Easter is nearly upon us and NOT 1 Diabetic Easter Egg. You cater for Nut Allergies Gluten Free Diets Low Calorie Foods Low Sugar (NOT Diabetic food)  and a few other  Polish Foods Halal Foods Chinese Fookds Indian Foods  but NOWHERE are there any Diabetic Foods. For such a worldwide name you are sadly lacking in this area. I have enquired in stores and staff know nothing of you stocking such foods for Diabetics. Please amend this asap as there are many Diabetics who would like  a pice of cake or a biscuit or even a pice of chocolate so they dont have to ruin their health (eyesight   kidneys  etc) because the only produce is NON Diabetic. I look forward to your response  Thank You					2016-03-02T20:21:44+0000	1456950104	2016-03-02 21:21:44	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The driver was not only 20 minutes late  she didn t even apologise for being late  I didn t get my receipt  and she wandered off up the road to her friends house  leaving the van outside my driveway for 20 minutes  with the shutter rolled up. I thought the whole point for paying for delivery was that it was between that one hour  and surely if she was going to be late I should have been contacted to say so? Really frustrated about this; I ve never had an issue before but I sat waiting in for my delivery and it was late. This is unacceptable behaviour. The reason I paid for that delivery slot was so that it would actually come on time? It s also not the first time I ve not been given my paper receipt either  or told if there were any substitutions  which there has been in the past and I ve not had the option to return them.					2016-03-02T19:32:50+0000	1456947170	2016-03-02 20:32:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a TV from you in July 2014. Seven months later the screen had dark marks all over it.  I contacted you and you arranged a repair via a third party. I explained at the time I was not happy about that as the fault I thought was with the TV.  The marks on the screen have come back in exactly the same place. I contacted you and was told I should expect a call  I confirmed my mobile number with the staff member. I got no phone call and chased you to be told I was sent an email. I got no email.  I called his evening and was put through to someone who told me you are going to refund me £160 for the TV.

Young lady who eventually went to the tills at Royals express store  southend was either not the brightest spark or I feel her customer service was something to be desired. I asked could she reset the self checkout pls. She just said  that one aint working.  Well I know that straight away. The idea was to login and correct it and it could be used again.					2016-03-02T18:20:24+0000	1456942824	2016-03-02 19:20:24	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of your tesco employees stood with the lady while another employee went to get her a trolly with a wheel chair.  Unfortunately there were none available but she returned with a normal wheelchair.  The two lady employees then helped the lady into the wheelchair.  What happened next made me smile  one of the ladys then pushed the woman around tescos in her wheelchair while the other pushed the womans trolly and helped to get all of the ladys shopping.  They also packed her shopping and took her outside and waited for a taxi for her.  They helped her into the taxi and helped put her shopping in the boot.   I just wanted to let yous know that these two ladys deserve a huge pat on the back they took that extra bit of time and consideration to help a customer in need and show genuine compassion to make sure she was ok.  Well done to these two ladys. you should be very proud!					2016-03-02T15:52:51+0000	1456933971	2016-03-02 16:52:51	2266	133	2339	130	2602	123	102	21	117	0	2238	62	8	0	0	0	0

The problem is  every other supermarket I had visited had opted to sell their hot pepper variants (birds-eye  Thai) in a restrained 20 or 30g format  something I can t understand. How is the average person supposed to start their own chilli jam business from their kitchen without access to a wholesaler?   Anyway  I saw the 250g packet in your convenience shop and to be honest it s still nowhere near big enough for my needs. How did you arrive at 250g exactly as opposed to a round kilogram? What is the package sizing in your Thai stores  and why does their perceived higher tolerance for spice trump my need to make exotic conserves in bulk?  Please advise as to why there isn t a range of options in sizing for this product. For example  a 250g bag such as this might be adequate for a day s sandwiches for my mother in law. However  for the necessary benefits to those manufacturers without a Macro card it is abundantly clear that an additional 1kg bag and maybe a 5kg bag would not be amiss.   Please respond at your earliest convenience as I really need to be starting production.

The customer car park has room for about 40 customer cars and backs onto one of the main roads into the centre of Exeter  probably about 15 - 20 mins walk from Exeter Centre. The car park was full  I nearly didn t stop  as I assumed the store would be busy and queues at the till  I was going to go to Co-op 2 mins drive away but I specifically wanted the Soup offer.  A car pulled out of a an awkward car parking space at the side of the store and I drove into it.  I had found the only car parking space available.  I was stunned or should I say flabbergasted to find out that there were only 3 customers in the store.  The Manager  think he was called Arek  explained that there is no sign up saying customers shopping only or 30 mins maximum  to stop non customers parking there.  One driver parks in the car park everyday and then walks to work  saving £25 a week perhaps on car parking.  All the streets around there  are now residents permit  as drivers were using them for free park and walk to work.  People park in the Tesco car park and walk to work  go to the Doctors surgery  go to Wetherspoons across the road which has no customer parking or shop elsewhere down the road.  This Tesco car park needs signage  limiting parking to customers only 30 mins maximum while you shop in store and some kind of parking attendant.  Bottom line  I thought the store was full due to lack of parking and wouldn t have stopped unless I specifically wanted the soup.  Arek the manager said that he had spoken to a  driver who used the car park all day  parking in the same space daily  explaining that the car park is for customers  not a park and ride  the driver just said  what you gonna doing about it  - word has got round you can park all day  for free - full car park and empty store.  No way can you compare this stores performance and sales targets with other Tesco Express until you sort out the parking fiasco.					2016-03-02T13:29:04+0000	1456925344	2016-03-02 14:29:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I do my main shop online and I never spend £20 in one go in store. It is a shame that those that do the majority of their shopping online miss out on these deals.					2016-03-02T10:06:17+0000	1456913177	2016-03-02 11:06:17	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My children are grown up now but i would like to make a request....in your stores maybe you could allow children to eat free fruit /veg whilst their parents are shopping along with perhaps a small bottle of water.  Believe me sometimes you cant shop easily with children and an already stressful outing becomes even more so.  I think this would be a fab idea as long as children were monitored by their parents to avoid any choking issues  and would encourage healthy earing from an early age ..... this free healthy food should be offered at fast food outlets too to provide a balance between naughty and nice. Just a suggestion					2016-03-02T07:51:40+0000	1456905100	2016-03-02 08:51:40	2	34	2	0	36	25	11	14	77	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I am unable to finish mine due to the short and wiry white hair I found in the middle. As a brunette I am slightly put off as to where this may have come from as is most definitely not mine and was nicely nestled in the middle with the prawns and pollock. Safe to say I doubt I will be eating them again soon. Your comments and feedback are appreciated.

Not only did your driver carry everything inside for me- when he saw how excited my 19month old was to see his  Truck!  (One of his favourite words) he let him sit in his van after everything had been bought in. It really & truly made not only my day but definitely my little boy s. Thank you to the driver - such a little touch  but meant so much to us.

After leaving the store I realised my 9 month old had lost his drinking cup. I went back  but it wasn t in the salon. There was however a manager of tesco there who got me a new cup right off the shelf for my baby which I didn t have to pay for. I was so shocked and surprised. What lovely customer service. I was so grateful. Please can this be noted. I m sorry I didn t get the ladies name  but she was lovely. Well done tesco!

I was told they only had barbecue sauce instead of tomato  sauce but they could make the pizza up without sauce & I could buy my own sauce & add it when I got home  was I supposed to remove all the topping & then add the sauce???? The girl said the barbecue was lovely so I told her to put that on. It was disgusting & actually tasted more like HP brown sauce instead. The whole family were disappointed as it had to go in the bin. I can t understand how a store like Tesco can run out of tomato sauce for a pizza when they sell Lorry loads of the stuff. I was out of pocket by the price of the pizza plus I had to get another tea for the family. Sort it out Tesco  either don t make pizzas without tomato sauce or stock your pizza counter.					2016-03-01T21:14:34+0000	1456866874	2016-03-01 22:14:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We bought this on Sun in Tesco s Redding (near Falkirk).  It s obviously been dropped or tampered with but then been sellotape closed and put back on the shelf  probably by staff.

There are such lovely staff in the little Tescos on Bishopstoke Road  Bishopstoke that both my partner and I always come out shocked thinking wow - that s refreshing!  I was most recently served by Chelsea but they are all very nice in there and go out of their way to be polite and helpful  going far further than most assistants would.    I also had a Tesco delivery this evening which was quarter of an hour late  I got a text to tell me it would be late which was great  then an amazingly professional  friendly and polite driver delivered my goods  profusely and guenuinely apologising for being late highlighting what had a short life and what substitutes had been made - one was a bit odd (as they sometimes are...) I had ordered a shampoo and conditioner  and the conditioner was out of stock so I had been substituted shampoo instead...a bit odd  surely you would just choose a different conditioner?! I would have been annoyed at this as I will now not be able to wash my hair tomorrow  but the driver was too lovely to be annoyed with!  I don t usually comment on service but all Tesco staff I have dealt with recently have been so good I thought I should mention it. :)  You re either very good at recruiting or very good at training!					2016-03-01T20:45:36+0000	1456865136	2016-03-01 21:45:36	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a regular £100+ a week shopper  when your child is un-expectedly violently poorly within store around staff  and I m all alone.  Every little helps  doesn t quite cut it... 2 members of staff saw me and the floor covered in vomit with a distressed baby  1 decided  sorry I can t help  it s break time  while one gipped and ran off?! I had to roam the aisles covered in vomit  for help only to find 1 helpful staff member. After being helped by the only staff member willing helping me wipe down and compose myself  to be suggested  to leave and sort my child out before returning to store  in a manner I can only describe as belligerent. Absolutely disgusted. No first aider  no one willing  no cleaner - goes to show every little doesn t help... Appalled at the level of service. However I want to thank the ONE member of nearly 5 I saw who helped me  I ll be ensuring she gets the praise in store she deserves. Contemplating never returning! So frustrated and upset.					2016-03-01T19:15:41+0000	1456859741	2016-03-01 20:15:41	9	16	10	11	37	16	11	5	40	0	9	0	0	0	0	1	0

I m a loyal tesco customer that has weekly shopping delivered  with bags  because my mobility is very poor it s much easier for me to carry bags through the house. But anyway I can t get into store to vote. I sent my husband all the way to tesco today for milk and newspaper  just to vote. It took him a while to find the box  and despite buying a bag was not given a token. So had to que at customer service.  I would like to see an option to vote with the home shopping  I feel because of my disability my right to vote has been taken away from me.   However  I think this is a good scheme  with some tweaking could be a great scheme that will benefit many community projects.

Today I did a weekly shop in your North Harbour store.   I was extremely disappointed with the half empty shelves that appeared to be there today. Now I m guessing Wednesday is your delivery day due to the gaps in products   As a full time parent  husband and shift worker  today was my only opportunity to complete the weekly shop and I m now finding myself having to visit alternative supermarkets to complete this task (which I struggle to tolerate at the best of times).   Can I also bring to your attention the rudeness and lack of respect for other shoppers some of your staff have. The personal shoppers you employ clearly need some training in manners and customer services. I lost count how many times I nearly got run over by those trolleys they use and pushed out of the way whilst trying to complete my shop.   Maybe I could have dealt with this a bit better if I was to have been able to buy the watermelon that I had spent 10 minutes searching for which you had run out of or couldn t be bothered to restock and also the 10 mins I had spent searching for the tea cakes that again appeared to be missing from your shelves.   In the current climate of trying to save money and retaining customers I would have thought an organisation like yourselves really should be doing more.   A very disgruntled customer who is now considering other options.   Phil					2016-03-01T18:01:45+0000	1456855305	2016-03-01 19:01:45	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My car insurance renewal was due today and  and I find myself asking why oh why did I renew with Tesco! I really should have known better..... I received an e-mail this morning with a link to download my documents.... Several attempts later  I gave up! The system kept telling me that I may have entered the wrong date of birth or postcode. Now I may get lots of things wrong in life but these really are two pieces of information which I can confidently say I am sure about..... when I was born  and where I live! So two phone calls later to Customer Support and I am told that apparently the leap year is to blame  their systems have been struggling since yesterday. Customers who have requested their policy documents by e-mail will have them sent in the post instead. I was then told that if I want them electronically once they sort their problem out I will need to ring to request them!  So a couple of questions Tesco      I Understand that sometimes unforeseen problems occur with online  systems.But seriously if this is due to the leap year  it can hardly be seen as unforeseen can it? It comes around every four years.....Did you not see this coming?  Was there any customer testing of your system in preparation for this? And secondly why oh why do I have to call back to get my documents electronically  once you sort your system out? Would it not be good customer service to re issue them electronically as a matter of course with an apology for any inconvenience caused?					2016-03-01T17:18:53+0000	1456852733	2016-03-01 18:18:53	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I brought one thing on line and now keep getting emails telling me of things I can  but do not want to  buy. Tried to un-subscribe and can t. Contacted Tesco and they told me they have to un subscribe from their end and it will take 2 weeks - this is a long 2 weeks. Have tried to be fair on this but now guess the only thing to do is go public and let everyone know how Tescos operate - be warned don t buy on line from Tesco.  Be interesting to see if I get a response from here  if not I will play the long game and post this every day.					2016-03-01T17:02:06+0000	1456851726	2016-03-01 18:02:06	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In my local Tesco Express in Reading  though  the 3 charities to choose from were all in Wokingham - which is 10 miles away and a vastly different place demographically. Can you tell me why these were the charities on offer  and why no local causes were available?					2016-03-01T17:01:05+0000	1456851665	2016-03-01 18:01:05	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I baulked at the advice to  boil or steam for six to eight minutes.   W H A A A T ??  My florets get 2½ min. in minimal water — and that includes the stalks — which is spot-on  as far as I am concerned. I can t imagine what kind of soggy mess must result from three times as long cooking (and I m not game to try it.)  I ve discovered also that I can switch off the power at least a minute before cooking time  with there being sufficient residual heat in the ring and pan base to keep the water boiling away. If I do that every day  I ll save some six hours of electricity per year.					2016-03-01T15:07:44+0000	1456844864	2016-03-01 16:07:44	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Despite what you believe  your customers are not making an informed decision when they buy eggs or chicken meat. Most consumers have no idea what suffering the animal goes through during the egg and meat production process under the so-called  Red Tractor Assurance Scheme .   Free-range eggs and meat are more popular than ever  surely this is a sign that our meat and egg industry  and most importantly the shops that sell them  need to change to meet this ethical demand.   Please don t ignore this issue any longer  or fob us off with a copy & paste answer - make a change and lead the charge. It s the right thing to do.					2016-03-01T14:16:57+0000	1456841817	2016-03-01 15:16:57	2	18	2	1	21	18	9	9	29	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Took 2 bottles from display at end of aisle and asked assistant if they were still reduced. His answer was yes. Got to checkout and was charged £3.90. This happens all the time and I am sick of it.  Most supermarkets in Greenock also charge you £2 for 2 bottles of irn bru. Local shops charge £1.49 for a 2 litre bottle. Tesco prices range from 2 for £2.50 to £1.79 for a single bottke I find your sales tactics on these drinks misleading to the customer and encourages me to shop elsewhere.					2016-03-01T14:03:42+0000	1456841022	2016-03-01 15:03:42	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Lego have no notice of recall or fault  is someone in your stores stealing the best ones or what? This comes from a variety of sources by the way on a thread  so its not isolated. Perhaps I should ask Lego to comment too  as I am sure they will be interested to hear they have a faulty product?					2016-03-01T13:33:05+0000	1456839185	2016-03-01 14:33:05	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yet with all the savage cuts that West Berks is making  cancelling all support to the voluntary organisations delivering valuable local services  like Mencap  they can t come up with a local charity? What they have come up with is: A log cabin in Burghfield to observe the wildlife A sports facility in Reading / Padworth An eco garden in Tilehurst.  What? These things are nice enough to have in another economic climate - but for the people of Reading  not Newbury! We need to support essential local services previously local authority funded and now cut.   So until Tesco has a better idea about who to donate the money to  I m hanging on to my little plastic disks.

After reading about how one of your suppliers  (Muller in this case) are reducing the price paid to its farmers do you feel in any way responsible for the knock on affects of the lower incomes farmers face? It s well documented that milk costs more to produce than the 20ppl Muller have informed their farmers that will receive for Aprils milk! Tesco may operate a. C.O.P contract but also buy milk and dairy products from Muller. As one of the largest supermarkets the power is in your hands to help British dairy farmers survive this crisis.... It s time to step up and do your bit before it s too late!!! The answer to this crisis is staring us all in the face yet nothing is done to correct it!!					2016-03-01T13:00:17+0000	1456837217	2016-03-01 14:00:17	6	4	6	0	10	4	3	1	2	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is now becoming very rare that you actually have this in stock! It is a nightmare to buy this milk and most high street stores don t stock it. I would just like to know as my husband has spoken to one of your employees this morning about the stock control issue  why are you selling such limited supply of this milk? It seems to be in great demand as it is always sold out. Your employee couldn t tell us when it will be back in stock   which isn t any good for us as we now have to drive 60miles round trip to try another one of your stores...I would like to know why you stock so much of the regular baby milk  which there is always plenty of in every store and not more of the comfort milk?  A baby who needs this milk can become quite poorly if given regular milk as a substitute. I have had to use this milk with two of my children in the past 6 years and the stock control in your carmarthen store isn t getting any better. There is plenty of shelf space in your baby isle so I would like to think you would give this some consideration to help parents like us have happy settled babies.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12794372_10156568956060716_7850780205664583035_n.jpg?oh=ccb4ef994fb8b344c0dcc31bddd45c4b&oe=591632F4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12794372_10156568956060716_7850780205664583035_n.jpg?oh=b263ff6696c2a29835761fc467a7beef&oe=5913AF53	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156568956060716&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-03-01T11:28:16+0000	1456831696	2016-03-01 12:28:16	1	12	1	0	13	12	4	8	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would very much like to send my thanks to the man who went above and beyond to help me during this crisis. A small act of kindness made all the difference to such an otherwise awful day.					2016-03-01T11:02:14+0000	1456830134	2016-03-01 12:02:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I d got a flat tyre and couldn t get the wheel undone  I was beginning to panic about how I was going to get the kids home and as we were stuck on a country road  in the dark  in the middle of nowhere obviously my children were getting very distraught thinking we d be stuck there forever. Your delivery driver drove past us and seeing us broken down stopped too see if we were ok  after explaining that I couldn t get the wheel undone and whilst I was trying to reassure 2 children that they would get home your lovely driver offered to help. Not only did he manage to get the wheel off  he also changed it for us and chatted the whole time to me and my children calming us all down and even had the children laughing by the time he d finished. I managed to find out his name was Tony and he was from the Banbury store  please could you pass on our families gratitude to him and make sure this lovely man gets the recognition he deserves. He really went above and beyond for us tonight when I m sure he was probably busy with deliveries but still made time to come to our aid. Thank you so much Tony  you re a star!!!
