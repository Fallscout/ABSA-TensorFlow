Since when has cat food been under hair care!? Its not persuading me to buy different items  its just annoying me.  Plus  how come delivery prices have suddenly increased a lot!? The double up event has stopped  delivery prices increased  the website is all over the place & annoying & your meat has gone downhill. Maybe its time to try another supermarket :(					2016-06-30T22:25:31+0000	1467325531	2016-07-01 00:25:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just gone to eat one of bananas and once I had bitten into it I looked at my banana and noticed that it was all brown hard down the core inside. I spat out what was in my mouth. I opened another banana and noticed the same. I think this is disgusting. People be warned when buying bananas. I have researched what it is and its a fungus in the bananas and makes you sick.

I was given an  ASOS  gift card as a birthday present which was bought in your rainham store. I tried to use it on Asos and was unable to. I contacted Asos who said to return it to tesco. Your Colchester store said they couldn t look it up as wasn t bought there. I even had the receipts as proof! The only thing  Tesco  would offer me was a  goodwill  Tesco voucher!!!! All I wanted was a refund or a new Asos voucher! Why is this such a challenge!? Any help would be appreciated.

We decided to visit the Caf√© for some lunch and grabbed a table and I went and ordered our food.  My son has major sensory issues and because of this can get upset and scared at noises and sounds that you or I wouldn t even notice. It could be a hand dryer  a hoover  a coffee machine or something we aren t even aware of.  I could tell on our visit that his anxiety levels were rising and I put it down to the coffee machine being so loud and the fact that it was going off quite regularly. The Caf√© was getting busy which could have also contributed to his stress levels.  My son started to get upset and stressed which meant he was becoming louder and people were starting to look over at us. A very nice member of staff named Rachael came over and informed me that I couldn t have my meal as the chef hadn t prepared any that morning. She told me that I would be refunded for this error and so I received my meal for free which I thought was great customer service.  She told me to pick anything else that I wanted from the menu. After taking my order she came back with everyone else s food and I had to wait longer for mine. This made my little boy even more anxious so I gave him my iPhone to watch in the hope that it would be a distraction for him. Normally if we are out and about and he gets upset  he will watch cartoons on my phone and be much calmer.  Today it wasn t working and his anxiety levels peaked and he went into meltdown mode. He was extremely upset and stressed out and was shouting and screaming very loudly. I noticed people looking over at us and I guess its part and parcel of having a son on the spectrum but it doesn t make it any easier.  My daughter was also becoming bored and anxious which made her cranky and upset. This makes my son even more stressed and it also made me feel pressured to calm him down. We tried everything with him: talking to him  singing to him  tickling him  distracting him  giving him the iPhone but nothing was working today. Most days  one of those distractions works but not today. I genuinely felt lost and was ready to get up and walk out without having my lunch. Then the very nice lady called Rachael walked over and approached my son. She addressed him by his name (as she had heard me talking to him) and got down to his level and placed a little booklet in front of him.   It was a free Tesco Healthy Eating booklet which were on display at the till and it had stickers inside it so you can create your own farm. She handed the booklet to my son and asked him if he would like to do some stickers. She opened the booklet and showed him the stickers and almost immediately he stopped and looked at her and said  stickers . My son doesn t use many words so this was massive for him. She spent a few minutes calmly talking to him.  I thanked her for what she had done and proceeded to help my son with the stickers where he created his own farm. He sat there for the rest of our meal  happy until we had finished.  I called Rachael over and thanked her for the way she dealt with my son. When everyone else was staring and his anxiety levels were rising  she came over and gave him 5 minutes of her time. What people don t realise is that what she did would impact the rest of our day. If he would have remained in meltdown mode then we would have had a horrendous day with him but just a little thinking outside the box and offering him her time made a huge difference and gave us a happy boy.  She told me that a friend of hers teaches children with additional needs and that she recognised what was happening with my son. I think this is absolutely fantastic and this lady changed the course of our day just by being understanding and giving him 5 minutes of her time. In a situation where I was getting stressed out and wasn t sure of what to do next  she used simplicity and diffused a challenging situation.  I would like to publicly thank Rachael for doing what she did. Not many people have an awareness or an understanding of Autism and it can be very challenging and scary for people on the spectrum and also for their families.  I would like this message to be passed on to her please so that she is aware how grateful we are and I think you should be proud of having a member of staff like Rachael in your Failsworth store. All staff should have some basic training in dealing with people with additional needs. At the end of the day its a customer facing role and your customers are all different and every store should be an inclusive store.  Thank you Rachael.					2016-06-30T21:07:13+0000	1467320833	2016-06-30 23:07:13	3522	333	3865	813	5011	330	286	44	602	0	3488	315	21	2	2	0	0

I ve had to ring customer services and been kept on hold and still no explanation apart from being told it would be up to 45 mins late..now wondering if I should brave the torrential rain and walk to the shop for packed lunch stuff as possibly not going to get any shopping any time soon.

Good amount of chocolate compared to the more well known brand in store and extremely tasty. Not sure if these are a brand that comes under the Tesco umbrella or if they are a brand that exist in their own right but I loved them - so much so I had to go back and have another one and will be purchasing the white chocolate ones next.

She was busy rushing about but still took a time out to look for a plaster and offer us some fruit while we waited. :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13528754_1071000109648131_4253974573174037526_n.jpg?oh=041e9bd2b913b07372211c6215c3573c&oe=5922B6BB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13528754_1071000109648131_4253974573174037526_n.jpg?oh=0d6e670a8e06f2b16511a4851c551312&oe=58E580AE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1071000109648131&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-30T19:38:15+0000	1467315495	2016-06-30 21:38:15	1	3	1	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to make a sandwich ealier and came accross flies on the loaf  ive been put off eating bread now as you dont ever think you will find that in your loaf. I returned it to store and was informed that the bread is sliced and repackaged in store and that it would have came from the supplier outside.. If this is the case why would your baker not notice flies on the load before cutting and repackaging it.. I was offered a refund or another loaf of bread which i declined.. I think they may need to look in to this as its unexceptable!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/13537985_10155087520939863_1911046324_n.jpg?oh=c73b4d99afc0ab1a6b7b0d231349adcc&oe=58E9D125	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/13537985_10155087520939863_1911046324_n.jpg?oh=c791c37e8f24a061f710c433bf7c740f&oe=5924AAE8	https://www.facebook.com/10155089437009863/videos/10155087511529863	facebook.com	2016-06-30T19:32:07+0000	1467315127	2016-06-30 21:32:07	1	8	3	0	11	8	3	5	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0

It s teatime in my house  as well as many others across the country (I d imagine) and I decided to do something a little different for my family s tea. Gnocchi  I thought. So I grabbed the packet out of the pantry  (no  I don t live at Highclere Castle or have butlers  I just have a cupboard under my stairs where I store all the dried foods  tinned foods  and the cheeky packet of Doritos I plan on demolishing one Saturday afternoon when my Husband and son have gone out)  boiled the water and tipped them in; very useful cooking instructions on the packaging  I must say  for a beginner gnocchi chef like myself. However...and this is where my problem-free teatime quest becomes a story full of woe  self-doubt and a fair amount of pity -  why me?    why did I pick gnocchi for tea?    what did I ever do to Tesco?    I m hungry ...floating at the top of the pot was this delightful little bundle.   What the...  was my first thought  and you may imagine my surprise and disgust as I grabbed the nearest utensil and fished it out. My second thought turned to my dinner. Was it ruined? Did I have enough time to substitute the delicious pasta parcels I was lovingly preparing for my family? Was this blunder going to throw my diet out of whack for the day? No  of course not! I ll get onto the ol  Book of Faces and tell you guys all about it  in the hopes that by the time I d finished writing War and Peace  some suggestions for alternative foodstuffs for my dinner.

Well  not technically me  but yes my car was parked in your carpark. While my daughter spent some of her money in your shop. And then for a while when she pootled around other shops in Silverburn. You remember  Tesco  the other shops that make your Silverburn location so attractive to my family and others. And then still parked for a while when she returned to complete her shopping in your store.  So yes  Tesco  she broke your rule by leaving the car for longer than your arbitrary time limit. Which she could have done quite easily by spending a little more of her time (and  once again  her money) in your recently refurbished cafe.  I can prove to you  Tesco  that I was not on your property on the day you charge  since I was at work  and I can see no basis on which I have to disclose to you - who have no authority over me - who had custody of my car that day. But life is too short  and there is far too much else to worry about  to engage in a petty legal battle with a conglomerate.  So  Tesco  you may have my ¬£40. And with it  my disgust at your treatment of your customer. You may have my ¬£40  but be assured it is the last you will have from me or from my family.  A formerly loyal customer.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13502044_1043992475697761_386077278253291232_n.jpg?oh=72030eac63068111b1e7413cbc437017&oe=58DE14BD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13502044_1043992475697761_386077278253291232_n.jpg?oh=0d9c7697f9c22fd2370289226c20c4fe&oe=58D9E742	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1043992475697761&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-30T16:52:56+0000	1467305576	2016-06-30 18:52:56	11	11	12	1	24	10	8	2	8	0	11	0	0	0	0	1	0

I received an email stating that my order was confirmed and I would receive my delivery between 2-4 on Thursday. Today Thursday at 15.50 I received an email to say my order had been cancelled due to lack of stock. Two phone calls later to your helpline and customer services. I m still very disappointed that tesco  won t honour their side of the transaction. Tesco let me waste my day waiting  for an order that they had no intention of delivering. When I asked if tesco would honor the transaction I made with them I was told no even tho I was told my order was confirmed. Shame on you tesco.

I was heading back to my car with a full trolley and 10 week old son in his car seat on top of the trolley. The gentleman who was clearing the trolleys away came over to me  told me to sort my car seat out and he would load my shopping into the boot for me. He was so helpful and came out of his way to do so. I don t know his name but I see him there regularly. He had dark hair and was wearing a high vis vest over his uniform. I do hope the Manager of the store thanks him. It was lovely customer service. It can be difficult managing shopping on your own with a baby. Thanks again!					2016-06-30T15:32:12+0000	1467300732	2016-06-30 17:32:12	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Calm down tesco  she put the sweet back I didn t need to be stalked and watched by 3 members of staff whilst I scan our shopping.. Then approached and made to feel like she had stolen a telly.. She s a little child for gods sake.. 3 members of staff having a melt down telling us off and moaning  no one else can now buy these sweeties now ... And saying its stealing in a loud voice and talking about us.. just because she went to take one..

We did our weekly shop in Tesco today using the self scanner as usual. At the checkout we were told that a full search and check if all our shopping was required. No reason given but we had to stand in full view of the shop whilst two staff members went through all our shopping! We felt like we were being accused of shop lifting  and our previous quick checks have always been ok  so why? Robert complained to a manager afterwards and was told that was life in as many words.

I ve been having my eyebrows threaded for the past 5 years and always happy with the results.  However yesterday I decided to go somewhere new ( Tescos Sandhurst around 5pm ) and as you can see from the photo attached it looks like I ve been attacked by a cat rather than had a pamper.  I m so upset.  I m going to have to hope a lot of make up can rectify the mistake that you have made.  PLEASE SHARE!!  As I wouldn t want anyone else to experience   Tescos pampering  . ( It still really hurts- this is not normal)üò•	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13501798_10157041152970117_5720279535437740832_n.jpg?oh=5ef8ea0f38ac3f2b89e749242984044b&oe=58E736B8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13501798_10157041152970117_5720279535437740832_n.jpg?oh=6214a4b3ddb64439b3aefb495cd7681b&oe=5918EA5E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157041152970117&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-30T10:47:32+0000	1467283652	2016-06-30 12:47:32	2	12	3	2	17	11	9	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	1	0	0

I have a 6 month old and a three door car  I need the room to open my car door fully to get him out  that and somewhere to put my pushchair.   The amount of lazy people parking in the parent and child spaces when they don t have any children prevents me getting my son out the car safely and  without damaging mine or someone else s car.   I have raised this in store and they said it isn t enforced  nor is is disabled parking.   Sainsburys enforce their parking to ensure everyone who needs a space gets it.   Is there not something you can do to prevent this?					2016-06-30T08:51:39+0000	1467276699	2016-06-30 10:51:39	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This afternoon  having just picked up my car from its MOT  I popped in to Tesco in Bursledon to pick up a few bits. Unfortunately when I went to leave my battery was completely flat. I have to admit that I panicked a little! It has never happened to me before and I didn t know what to do. I had let my membership to the RAC lapse and when I called them they said they would charge me ¬£130.00 to come and jump start my car! As a last resort I went and spoke to TINA at customer services. I explained the situation  fully expecting that they wouldn t be able to help me. Little did I know that you employ such wonderful people!! After trying and failing to call someone  TINA went on a mission to see if there was anyone who could help. She returned with SIMON from dot.com (I think). He had jump leads in his car so was going to jump start me. I seriously wanted to kiss him!!! I was parked in a bit of a tricky spot so he decided to try to push me to a hill and try and bump start it. With the help of a kind man in the car park he succeeded!! So thank you  thank you  thank you to TINA and SIMON. There are some good people out there and today I met two of them.

First time we have been here and we won t be coming back..  Security guard seemed really pleased with himself when the dreaded alarm went off as we were leaving shame we soon wiped the smile off his face when we produced our receipt and he was like ohh..

I forgot to add milk to my shopping list and within 5 minutes I had a knock at the door and they had returned back to my house with 2 pint milk for me that they had grabbed from the shop around the corner. It was so thoughtful of them and very unexpected. Put a smile on my face and they deserve to recognised for this ‚ò∫Ô∏è					2016-06-29T20:41:48+0000	1467232908	2016-06-29 22:41:48	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

We thank you Claire and all others who helped x   I want to thank the staff at Tesco Rochdale for how they cared and helped my lovely neighbour this afternoon after some low life scumbag stole her handbag. She had withdrawn money at the cash point outside the store  something she never normally does and whilst shopping in the store her bag was stolen. She is a petite lady in her early 70 s who would do anything for anyone.  The Manager who my neighbour said is called Claire Gaffrey went above and beyond  she obtained all the numbers my neighbour needed to cancel her cards and block her phone straight away  something that my neighbour tells me she would have struggled with  and put my neighbours shopping through the checkout at no charge to make sure she had  the shopping she needed.  My neighbour has been badly shaken up but keeps saying how lovely the Tesco staff were with her  so thank you again Tesco especially Manager Claire    Michelle Giles do you know her??					2016-06-29T18:37:45+0000	1467225465	2016-06-29 20:37:45	3	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ordered and received 2 10x8 metal sheds from Tesco Won t say it was a smooth transaction as the roofs never arrived and then did seoerately But we got them! On the 8th June we then decided we d order another 8x6  Chased it up today only to be told because you re on the Isle of Wight the supplier won t come So not only have we wasted 20 days  were without the shed!!!!! The 3 sheds some to just over ¬£1000  They could have said there s a surcharge towards it Staggered that a company the size of Tesco accepts this from their suppliers Glad to know they re obviously busy enough to turn away orders and satisfy a customer!

Oliver my little 2 year old had cut his head on the car door as we were about to enter the store  I went and asked for a first aider to give it a wipe to see how bad the cut was and all the staff I came across from security to the customer service desk  the lovely lady who applied first aid  the duty manager and of course fernando who made Oliver smile with a juice and magazine were totally amazing and super helpful. You guys just made a horrible situation for me a lot easier and made my little boy feel a lot better. Luckily it was only a small cut but the staff at this tesco store made a big difference! Thank you! :-) these guys deserve a big pat on the back! X					2016-06-29T13:20:01+0000	1467206401	2016-06-29 15:20:01	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Right since the store was first opened I have written to you many times  and commented here and in my surveys that a foot access on the north side would make much more sense; the way you constructed it  every single foot customer had to walk across your car park  sometimes negotiating with your delivery lorries too.  Thank goodness that as from now all customers coming from the north will not have to walk in your car park at all; and customers coming from the south now have the choice whether to take a chance crossing your car park and delivery bays or whether to walk a few paces further north and walk in complete safety around the newly constructed  pavement .     Out of interest  I wonder if you would consider letting us know how many accidents to people on foot have been reported in your car park (though I appreciate that some would be drivers and passengers getting to/from their cars).  I also appreciate that not all incidents would have been reported  not to mention  near misses ...... big big thanks for making your premises that much safer!					2016-06-29T12:04:11+0000	1467201851	2016-06-29 14:04:11	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked her if she had some tissue she asked what had happened if we were okay and she offered me first aid( which I declined ) and got him a ice lolly to help with the swelling. It was a lovely thing to do even if he didn t want it. What lovely caring service !!

On June 26th I ordered a clubCard boost  which usually is delivered very promptly. However this time it took 36 hours for the email to reach me which meant the boost promotion had run out. When I email customer services  they refunded the clubCard point but told me it was my own fault for leaving the purchase until the last minute. Yes I was last minute but I was still within the time frame detailed in the terms and conditions so I should have been able to use the vouchers. The new pairs of glasses I was going to put the vouchers towards are still sitting in the basket and I am thinking of going elsewhere for specs. Being told it is my own fault does not make for good customer services.					2016-06-29T10:43:27+0000	1467197007	2016-06-29 12:43:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But on 2 separate occassions i have brought your own brand nappies comfort dry ones in size 5+ for my daughter....   Before you changed the design with the  expandable sides (which i think is good)   My daughters nappies have exploded out of the side of them with the gel crystals...  Doesnt matter how many times i change her bottom... She has only got to have 1 wee in them and it does this.   I use to buy your nappies always but i have lost trust in your brand.   I have spoken to a few of my mummy friends who have had the same problem as this.   I have now decided to move to another supermarket brand					2016-06-29T10:29:03+0000	1467196143	2016-06-29 12:29:03	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was little more excited at the prospect of my delivery due to this fact  as I am sure you can imagine.  I have 2 things to report to you. 1. The delivery driver was marvellous  happy  friendly and extremely helpful. Something which has brightened my day. Been stuck in the house since Sunday so was nice to see a smiling face. My order number is 220388216  if this helps you to get a message back to him!  2. Unfortunately not great news for number 2. After the joy of my delivery it appeared to be snack time for my little (nearly) one year old girl  Arienne. Imagine my dismay when her favourite kingsmill pancakes were not there? Thankfully her being only 1 years old she seemed happy enough with a hot buttered crumpet so all was not lost (currently on offer 2 for ¬£1.20 may I add for the readers benefit). Anyway  I m not after a refund as its only a couple of pence but thought I d bring it to your attention. Had it been my nappies it could have been a different story. No nappies for arienne would have been a disaster of first world proportions  can you imagine?  Anyway  please try and pass my thanks on to Mr delivery man and tell if he comes across the pancakes  he s welcome!

It was a box of 4 glasses in bubblewrap in a box  in another box with more bubblewrap & paper packaging in another box! 3 large boxes 6 small boxes & loads & loads of paper & bubblewrap!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13529176_10154235170144098_3319249402068294825_n.jpg?oh=baead7404fd1f81f9ca644fe14f84e78&oe=5919153E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13529176_10154235170144098_3319249402068294825_n.jpg?oh=b6bd6eeee1401397917d6017da1aa110&oe=59186033	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154235170144098&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-29T09:31:06+0000	1467192666	2016-06-29 11:31:06	1	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

That s one way to diet  I guess!  It s ok though  even though I had to go shopping somewhere else first thing this morning (at my own additional expense) to be able to eat at all today  which utterly defeats the point of  home delivery  if nothing else  and have had to work from home today to collect my ¬£100 worth of groceries lest another delivery fails  I guess I did get offered a ¬£10  good will  voucher and ¬£1 delivery charge refund.   Absolutely unbelievable - it cost me more that in time wasted alone.   Obviously one customer moving to Ocado here as a direct result of this insult over injury  but I just wanted to let people know that it s pretty pointless relying on you lot. Even the  delivery manager (?) managed to ring me later than promised!  -  Valued customer   lol.					2016-06-29T09:28:21+0000	1467192501	2016-06-29 11:28:21	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Was supposed to cost nearly ¬£90 and when it came only ¬£70 of it was on the receipt. No meat - I ordered a full chicken  bacon  mince etc - all gone off the list. Some veg too including celery. Any idea why!? I have to go out now to top up  and I paid the delivery fee to get everything i put in my basket not just some of it  üò°					2016-06-29T09:16:05+0000	1467191765	2016-06-29 11:16:05	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I fancied something different today  I knew what I wanted but couldn t seem to locate it so thought I would ask one of your (usually) helpful and friendly staff...  Firstly  with this day and age of self scanning handsets I would NEVER assume that because someone was holding a hand scanner that they worked in the store.   Secondly I wouldn t assume that someone wearing a navy blue jumper worked in store either. (Unless Tesco have a trademark on that exact pigment that I was unaware of) especially as they don t say  Tesco  on the back.  So back to the story... I see this older lady wearing a navy jumper while scanning products and I wasn t entirely sure if she worked in the store. After a few failed attempts to check if she had a name badge or anything on her that may indicated she was in fact an employee  I thought I d just ask.   excuse me  do you work here  I said  with the friendliest consumer smile on my face I could manage at 9am.  She responded by holding the scanner up to my face and saying  WELL DUH?   Never been made to feel uncomfortable by a member of your staff before  but I think this encounter will stick with me for a while.  Manners... every little helps.					2016-06-29T09:06:53+0000	1467191213	2016-06-29 11:06:53	23	17	32	4	53	16	7	9	16	0	21	0	2	3	1	3	0

I just called in to my local Sainsburys because it s walking distance away. I just wanted a few emergency items as I didn t have time to go to my favourite tesco store.  I can t believe it but they actually refused to serve me because I wanted to use my nectar app instead of a plastic thing. What a gall! I have never had any problems in any Tesco or any other store that has a points card.  I have learned my lesson and will never spend one more pence in any Sainsburys stores.					2016-06-29T08:53:52+0000	1467190432	2016-06-29 10:53:52	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This from the people who the last time I had the misfortune to be expecting a delivery from them  eventually after I phoned them at gone 5pm  admitted they had forgot to put it on the van that morning !  Today  despite downloading thier app to my smartphone  and clicking on the box saying please only deliver between 9 am and 2.30 pm  at quarter to nine it said thier driver was 15 mins away  at 5 to nine he d been and gone and I d missed my parcel.  Now the only way I can get my parcel is to have it delivered to a shop  2 miles away  where even though I have a disability and have to take regular prescribed pain relief medication for a severe back injury  I have to go to and collect the heavy parcel myself  and then once I get it home carry it up 2 flights of stairs to my flat  and this is the service I paid so much for !!  Maybe in future you could give customers the option to arrange thier own delivery service  as I regularly use HERMES parcel delivery service  who are hands down a far better company. Yours sincerely  Miss Jessica Berry ( a customer about to be in agony ! )					2016-06-29T08:49:56+0000	1467190196	2016-06-29 10:49:56	0	3	0	1	4	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My question is...What happens to the food items that have been returned? Hopefully you don t re sell them ( as you don t know where they ve been ) and the alternative is throwing them away  which will increase food waste. I  myself work in food retail and I m also a food buying customer who is concerned about the amount of  waste created on a daily basis.					2016-06-29T07:37:11+0000	1467185831	2016-06-29 09:37:11	4	8	4	0	12	8	3	5	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

What I did get however  was tiny lumps of broccoli poking their heads up from what resembled a dry African river bed complete with cracks and in addition to that I was unable to find a piece of tomato anywhere....what I did find was a slathering of sweet sickly tomato puree under the cracked riverbed holding the darned thing together!!  My daughter had a different flavour  she had quiche Lorraine....oooh yummy I hear you say....not I think  again a dry river bed but this time it had pieces of what can only be described as a worn out girly pink trampoline cut into squares masquerading as ham...  If you insist on making food that defies description please do include a free stomach pump with every purchase   Yours sincerely   Hungry					2016-06-28T19:49:26+0000	1467143366	2016-06-28 21:49:26	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

While browsing the toy aisle  Autumn spots a pack of  puppy in my pocket  toys and immediately falls in love. I quickly check the price label - ¬£2.50! What a bargain!  My daughter states that  I am the best mummy ever  and in the trolley they go.  On going to check out  you can imagine my horror when the  so called bargain puppies  scan at ¬£10! Yes ¬£10!  I cannot dream of breaking a four year olds heart  so there s no way I can put them back.   I m dreadfully unhappy Tesco that not only am I ¬£7.50 down  but I also have five! (I repeat five!) hungry mouths to feed all due to a simple pricing error!  These dogs are going to eat me out of house and home!

Whilst at the same time part of the link road was shut. Already causing tail backs at the main roundabout. Tesco staff continued to stop traffic by the garage to tell each individual car the store was closed. Causing more tail backs onto the main road. Very frustrating as not all cars are visiting Tesco. Alot were actually going to Argos or Wickes. When we advised of the issues with the traffic the Tesco staff were very rude and ignorant. They seemed under the impression they were doing some sort of traffic job when in fact a simple sign saying Tesco Closed would have been sufficient. Or even stopping cars as they enter the Tesco carpark. It would have also saved us the 15 min waiting time. Thanks Tesco!					2016-06-28T18:25:15+0000	1467138315	2016-06-28 20:25:15	2	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were at the self scan checkouts so I was very aware of holding up the queue and I couldn t abandon my shopping and go to the toilets to tend to him.  A First Aider was called and David  a gentleman we usually see on the security desk came to our rescue.  To say he is a credit to you Tesco is an understatement  this man was beyond kind to my son.  Josh can become a little worried when he suffers a nose bleed and David kindly took him to one side and sat him down whilst I quickly scanned the last bits of my shopping. He sat with him for over 15 minutes until his nose had stopped bleeding  and then proceeded to clean him up from head to toe despite me offering to do it he told me that was no problem at all. David joked with Josh throughout the exchange  making light of what was a worrying situation for Josh. When Josh failed to understand some of his banter and I felt I needed to explain that Josh is autistic  David explained to Josh in a way he could understand. If you could pass on my thanks once again  and to say that Josh spoke about his kindness all the way home and will remember that act for a long time coming.					2016-06-28T17:35:51+0000	1467135351	2016-06-28 19:35:51	2687	163	2864	192	3219	161	130	31	313	0	2661	170	6	0	0	0	0

I needed to use the facilities however  not for the first time  found the disabled toilet to be out of order. Now  this is not just an  inconvinience  as suggested on the notice on the door but a serious problem! I have various mobility problems  trouble with my grip (ie I cannot pull open heavy fire doors) and I need grab rails so the usual ladies facilities are just not suitable. Are your disabled customers of that little importance that you cannot have one functioning disabled toilet in your entire store on multiple occassions? I will be having to find somewhere else to take my children for a drink and snack before their dance class in future if I cannot have assurances that this will not keep happening.					2016-06-28T16:05:02+0000	1467129902	2016-06-28 18:05:02	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What particularly appealed to me was that it was magenta (I already have an older kindle).  When it arrived I was very  very disappointed to find I had been sent a very unattractive blue one :( I was then taken into hospital sooner than anticipated due to a sudden decline in health and eventually had a 16 kg tumour removed! Now I am beginning to recover  I wanted to bring this to your attention. Thank you  K A Wright					2016-06-28T15:34:28+0000	1467128068	2016-06-28 17:34:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have visited Barnstaple  Exeter and Crediton stores several times over the last month and have been unable to get any reasonably priced apples. You teased us with the new brand of  perfectly imperfect apples  at 60p a pack but you have not had any in stock since the first week. Not only that you never have the other apples at 89p in stock. The more expensive ones at ¬£1.50 are too big for children and I cannot afford to buy them. These are all red apples!! What is going on????!!!					2016-06-28T15:32:37+0000	1467127957	2016-06-28 17:32:37	2	5	2	0	7	5	3	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The fruit and veg manager and a young lady called Emily from the chilled section. I requested to speak to a manager about some dried up spilled yogurt that was on the shelf in the fridge. My reason for wanting a manager was that I had previously mentioned this yogurt twice  once on Sunday and once LAST Tuesday. As luck would have it the lady I spoke to last Tuesday was the Fruit and veg manager from today. She quite rightly was disgusted that a week later I had to complain again. She offered me some free yogurts and was very apologetic (even though it wasn t her section). And Emily although not her mess was happy to clean the shelf there and then  both members of staff were friendly  helpful and willing to go out of their way to put it right. I didn t get the managers name  but I would like to thank her again. And I hope the manager responsible for the free from yogurt section and their staff thank her too.					2016-06-28T13:51:05+0000	1467121865	2016-06-28 15:51:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This tragic accident would not have happened if you had listened and addressed the continual complaints from local residents about the size of lorries delivering to this store. Furthermore had the delivery bay of your shop been cleared of rubbish instead of resembling the local rubbish tip the lorry in question would have been able to reverse properly into the delivery bay - instead the lorry over hung the pavement forcing pedestrians into the road. This elderly lady was forced into the road to continue her journey and was not seen by the driver as he left the store. Tesco your arrogance and disregard of the immediate neighbourhood is beyond belief.  You have done absolutely nothing to address these issues which have been highlighted to you time and time again  but you choose to operate completely as you choose. Yesterday you made the grand gesture of closing the store  but today you opened as normal - very sadly a lady s life was lost yesterday because of your refusal to deal with the on going problem of deliveries to this store. Just what does have to happen to make you listen.					2016-06-28T11:58:31+0000	1467115111	2016-06-28 13:58:31	21	25	27	7	59	23	18	5	36	0	21	0	0	0	4	2	0

Due to misinformation from a supervisor in store yesterday I did not get the ¬£13.49 brand match on my shop. He told me that you no longer did brand match and that is why it hadn t happened. If he had known the rules I would have put my split shop (buying for 2 people) as one and saved the money! How do I get this back without returning to the store to refund/ rebuy it all as that is hard from a wheelchair!					2016-06-28T08:42:27+0000	1467103347	2016-06-28 10:42:27	0	10	0	0	10	10	2	8	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I think Tesco need to check their description of food on the menu and also check how long the food has been sitting before dishing it up to their customers.  i certainly won t be eating there again.					2016-06-28T08:33:44+0000	1467102824	2016-06-28 10:33:44	0	9	0	0	9	9	1	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I decided to walk to Tesco at Tower Park in Poole but made the mistake of following Google maps which took me to a horrendous set of steep steps at the back of the store into the car park  all would have been well if I didn t have my pram with my 5 month old daughter inside. I panicked and was about to turn back to go and find an alternative way when I realised where Google maps had taken me but the two employees shouted out to wait and they helped lift my pram down the steep steps with no fuss at all. I personally went back later into the store and to the customer service desk to thank the two men again but I forgot to get their names I just hope the thank you got passed on to them.					2016-06-28T07:16:51+0000	1467098211	2016-06-28 09:16:51	2	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just want to say a massive thank you to 2 of the friendly men and the lovely lady who was working today. You did more than i could ever ask for. After getting stuck in a lot of traffic up at Luton Airport and running very low on fuel I couldn t find any other petrol station. I actually ran out of petrol just before the pump on the forecourt (partially blocking the entrance). I firstly asked a stranger if he could help me and hes response was if you cant find anyone else then i will have to but i am running late. The next man i asked just point blankly refused. Now feeling very emotional and angry and upset i went in and just stood in front of the tills where the lady serving (sorry didn t catch her name) asked if i was OK. i explained what happened and i was trying so hard not to cry :( she immediately buzzed for a colleague who got another gentleman and they came to my rescue without hesitation. I am so glad they were there because my car is to heavy for someone like me to push.  I am so grateful for these 3 members of staff that i wish i could do something to show my appreciation.  Thank again Tesco Harpenden  Love Hayley Theed (the lady in the stranded car)					2016-06-28T06:25:51+0000	1467095151	2016-06-28 08:25:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The lovley Mr on the phone replied  it s not a problem I m from Goole. I finish work at 6 so I will bring the items with me for you to collect at the Goole store . He didn t have to do this but little did he know that today is my birthday and the item was my birthday gift from my husband and children. I didn t get his name but I wanted to show my appreciation and send many thanks. People are so quick to judge when something goes wrong. But praise where it is due always goes a miss.

I was stressed to death as my sim had stopped working  half my contacts had disappeared and as I had no network I couldn t my travel tickets to work. I bumbled into the phone shop to be met by Alex who was brilliant. He got me a new sim  got my mobile data working and sorted it so i could keep my existing number and all would be back to normal in 24 hours. He did this in 5 mins. He is awesome at his job and a really nice lad. He managed to make a really stressful situation into nothing at all. Credit where its due as Alex was fantastic today. Great Service.

I lost my bank card in store between paying for my shopping  writing in a couple of birthday cards and going to the kiosk for stamps.   Amanda at customer services looked all around the checkouts etc where I d been whilst I was searching through my purse    put my shopping to one side whilst I went to retrace my steps  offered to get me some new replacement frozen food when it took a while to finally give up looking  Gave my 2 year old daughter a fake flower (left over from an event) to keep her occupied whilst I was looking.  Taped up the envelopes of the birthday cards i d opened to check It hadn t accidentally fallen inside   And gave me two stamps to post the cards (to my two 6 year old god children whose birthday it is tomorrow).  She was so helpful and friendly throughout  I was clearly stressed and my tired two year old was being a handful!  She took my details and phoned me when someone handed it in about 30 mins later!  She was fantastic! Went over and above my expectations and she deserves a real pat on the back for her commitment to the customer!!

Seeing as we collies have a reputation for being pretty smart  I like to make sure my mum is doing everything she should to be a responsible pet owner (it‚Äôs hard work looking after these humans!) so back in February I told her to buy me some pet insurance in case I get hurt whilst out and about and being wonderful. I directed her to your website and she was very happy to see your free clubcard points offer and I explained to her that she could use them to buy lots of bonios for me (well after all  it was my idea to get pet insurance  so it‚Äôs only fair!)  Unfortunately though  my human has checked her card recently and seen that there are no points there  and we having a crisis as there are no bonios in my treat jar! Please help us to fix this tragedy.

John Allan the Chairman  should remember the fact  he is just another employee of Tesco s nothing more nothing less.   If he does not like the tough questions from the shareholders who are the owners of Tesco s plc  then he should seriously consider his position.   This is just part of the response I received from John Allan at the AGM.  ‚ÄúYour claims are a work of fiction and in your imagination ‚Äù he boomed. ‚ÄúFor the rest of us in the real world  we are focused on improving the company  and we don‚Äôt get much help from your repeated interventions.‚Äù    It is my personal belief that John Allan in his position as Chairman of Tesco s plc not only abused his position in providing this slanderous response  he did provide false and misleading information to the shareholders at the AGM concerning Tesco s UK complete and utter failure to keep Tesco s stores clean in a fit and proper manner.   Furthermore as Chairman of Tesco s plc along with Dave Lewis CEO of Tesco s plc and Matt Davies CEO of Tesco s UK they have allowed these stores to operate in violation of the health and hygiene laws in the UK. Even though I have not only raise my concerns these three men I had also provided evidence to the Executive office. The failure of these to ensure that Tesco Stores were kept clean in a fit and proper manner  have placed Tesco s UK in great risk of prosecution and severe damage to the reputation of Tesco s UK.   Is John Allan refusing to accept what is going on in the real world in Tesco Stores???   Is it John Allan s own imagination that he is focused on improving and denying evidence showing that the very serious problems concerning the cleanliness in Tesco Stores???   May I suggest to John Allan as Chairman of Tesco s plc  resigned from your position and take your arrogance with you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13502107_10153486050021923_8506927462926369556_n.jpg?oh=bc7f6739c24594c08a50f516e52f30dc&oe=59202268	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13502107_10153486050021923_8506927462926369556_n.jpg?oh=8a818a4a4b6b5b07ba9cd89a4c70cbcb&oe=58D7568E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153486050021923&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-27T09:07:35+0000	1467018455	2016-06-27 11:07:35	1	15	1	1	17	12	2	10	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you please enlighten me as to why staff in the Bakery in your Duke St Leith (Edinburgh) store do not wear gloves when handling baked goods? I as a customer am required to use tongs but staff there feel it is acceptable to handle baked goods ungloved. Yes  their hands were washed. But surely gloves are required? I will be writing to the store manager and requesting an environmental health inspection from the Council.					2016-06-26T22:40:12+0000	1466980812	2016-06-27 00:40:12	0	10	0	0	10	10	2	8	10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Appropriate appreciation regarding drive aways is given  but unfortunately some bikes are best filled when the bike is vertical. An unobtainable option if the bike is on side stand  and not all bikes have a centre stand that would allow obtaining a full tank.  Could you please openly post the company policy for motorcycle usage at your fuel stations? With issues regarding some modes of religious dress  is it necessary for the rider to remove their helmet?

Yesterday I tried to boost my vouchers at Tesco Cross Point Coventry (a very nice store with friendly staff) unfortunately the clubcard machine was not responding and the problem could not be rectified. I asked a member of staff when the boost ended  in a positive voice she replied that it would be on for a few weeks. Happy in this knowledge I left the store empty handed of uniform. This evening I logged on at home only to find the boost expiry date is today! Frustratingly school uniform is not available on line so I m now left with no obvious options  are you in any position to help me purchase school uniform for my two children by boosting my club card vouchers and enabling me to use them in the coming days please?  Yours in hope Hazel					2016-06-26T21:29:51+0000	1466976591	2016-06-26 23:29:51	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Today we held a family fun day to raise funds to enable us continue the work we do. We had a burger van booked for the event and then not long after the event started  this person let us down. I went to our local branch of Tesco extra on Winwick road and filled a trolly with items which we needed to run a BBQ ourselves.  After having a chat with the lovely Ellie  who was duty manager for the day  she donated the meat in our trolley as a gesture of goodwill after I explained our predicament.  I would just like to say on behalf of the families we support  just how much her kindness meant.  Thank you Ellie for what you did for us.  Ellie is the lady in the middle of the picture  1 of our family benefitters  is on the right.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13528892_10209051005499658_5343224249815201241_n.jpg?oh=58d1f55ec0ccdb70a423a9d0c0236c88&oe=58E8798A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13528892_10209051005499658_5343224249815201241_n.jpg?oh=b475f2aaea06b156006f43c8fc911aea&oe=58EACF87	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209051005499658&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-26T21:14:47+0000	1466975687	2016-06-26 23:14:47	171	19	198	28	245	19	17	2	19	0	169	24	2	0	0	0	0

I even steped in as abit of support as u had 4 women staff members working.... those ladies working on today (26.6.16) deserve a bloody pay rise!! They always have a smile and nothing is to much trouble for them. They always help me when i go in and entertain my children so i can load up my bags and pay with ease.

I thought I d have a joint of British Gammon  but for some reason I could only get Danish gammon.  Okay  change of plan....I ll have a joint of pork! But guess what....it wasn t British either!!! Whaaaaaaaat???? I live in Great Britain I want to support Great Britains dying farming industry (dying farming industry probably because every single person that goes into tesco can t buy British meat even if they chuffin wanted to!) Sort it out Tesco and support British farmers before they go out of business and give your customers the opportunity to support them. I sourced my joint from a local farm shop after all every little helps üëç					2016-06-26T19:12:50+0000	1466968370	2016-06-26 21:12:50	65	13	66	0	79	13	10	3	7	0	65	1	0	0	0	0	0

I have just had to call customer service again  after finding two more rotten items in my fresh food from the Click and Collect order that I picked up two days ago. So far in the last few weeks I have had the following rotten items - slimy strawberries  squashy sweet potatoes  x 2 rotten cantaloupe melons (one was so bad it had to actually be poured away down the sink!!)  bananas with the skins all split  a brown pineapple and potatoes that were full of rot. What is going on with your fresh food lately? I have always shopped at Tesco for my fresh food as it has always been excellent quality but lately it has gone completely downhill. I am not a fussy consumer  I don t mind a bit of wonky veg or a bruise on my apples etc but rotten food is not on. (I do have photos but as i have already received refunds for each item I don t think it would be fair to show them  especially the video of the melon being poured out - it s vile!) Having said that you customer service advisors have been fab each time  very friendly and helpful. I just wish I didn t need to be speaking to them so often!.....it s getting embarrassing! Please tesco  sort it out before I have to defect to another supermarket. The new farm brand is rubbish and your other fresh bits are not much better recently :(					2016-06-26T17:35:13+0000	1466962513	2016-06-26 19:35:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner and I were in tesco Carrickfergus on Friday night.. We bought what we needed and inserted the card into self check out and left. We did not realise that we had either left the bank card in the machine or dropped it putting it away. We noticed on Saturday that the card was missing and remembering that tesco was the last plus that we had used it  went down to check.  We went down and the girl at the check out at customer service confirmed that the card had been handed in after checking ID .. However due to in incident happen else where in the building no one could access the card for us at that time. She said we could either wait or come down the next day assuring is it would be safe as it was locked away.  However when we went down this morning to collect the card that was not the case. Tesco lost the card!! All the paper trail was there saying it should be there; all details of the card wrote down so clearly the card has been there however in the bag in which the card should have been held in there was no card! Sounds funny right  it s a good thing we noticed when we did. Right now anyone could have that card so we have had to cancel the card because tesco have lost it after claiming that it would be perfectly safe locked away!  Appalling behaviour and does not reflect good on them whatsoever!  Please check that you have your card before leaving!					2016-06-26T16:57:52+0000	1466960272	2016-06-26 18:57:52	7	12	9	6	27	11	4	7	4	0	7	0	0	0	0	2	0

Sales Lady  Umm  thats for?  Me. Straining loose tea from a pot.  Sales Lady  Let s try the tea aisle. (lady looking smug as though I should have thought of that before asking).  Me  (feeling stupid why didn t I think of that before asking; they have those product strips in some aisles selling small items).  Sales Lady  Am sure I ve seen one on a product strip  ah yes here we go  is there anything else I can help you with?  Me  I stare down at the pizza cutter she s just handed me and polietly thank her and say no that s all...  So what have I learnt today? Well for some strange reason Tesco although they sell loose tea do not stock tea strainers in their Wisbech branch. However they do keep their pizza cutters in the tea aisle.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13524477_10153564122400776_2252595250595008123_n.jpg?oh=a0e6414c732a4227e6f95cca1f43503a&oe=591F6086	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13524477_10153564122400776_2252595250595008123_n.jpg?oh=a1a119d848cb5ddec69ab1ef76a8b256&oe=58D8D38B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153564122400776&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-26T14:34:07+0000	1466951647	2016-06-26 16:34:07	5	6	7	0	13	6	5	1	3	0	5	0	0	2	0	0	0

I have been billed twice  I ve spoken to customer support but their reply was wait and see if the money goes back in. NOT GOOD ENOUGH! I want my money back today! I can provide you with bank statements to prove I ve been billed twice!  A payment of ¬£72 was taken on Friday and a payment of ¬£61 was taken today when in fact I was due a ¬£11 refund for part of my order not being in stock.

Until this week that is. We were informed on the morning of our due delivery date that our order had been cancelled due to the money not being in the bank. So we checked our online banking to discover that ¬£120.00 has been removed from our account  as it has gone to yourselves. Our first issue with this is that our shopping bill was just under ¬£75.00. So the amount didn t even make sense. So my wife called customer services and spoke to a lady who basically said that it would be sorted by the next day. This would of been regrettable  but understandable.  (remember. Two small children.) The next day comes and no money in our bank  and no call from yourselves. So my wife speaks to the bank and you have our money  one of your customer service team confirms you have our money  but the lady dealing with this days that you havn t. They then inform my wife that the problem will be resolved Monday. We now have no shopping  no money and two children to feed. We have had to beg for money off friends and family  something I feel shamed to have had to do  just so our children can eat. But it s ok because you advised us that we would be  compensated . Probably in the form of online coupons to spend within your company. So yes happy times.					2016-06-26T11:58:01+0000	1466942281	2016-06-26 13:58:01	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just a message of thanks to the delivery driver of my tesco online order i had last night- i live in a top floor maisonette and in 7 years of living at this address and 7 years of ordering with tesco this was the first driver that actually offered to help me bring my shopping up my stairs to the kitchen.. He was so friendly and also told me that i should ask the drivers from now on to help as unless theres a risk they should be bringing it up for me.. Not only has no one ever mentioned this before but he seemed he genuinly wanted to make my life a bit easier. So thank you to him : ) p.s my local store is tesco hythe greenstead and my order was deliver at just after 9 last night. ..just incase you would like to reward said driver for being so good at his job :)					2016-06-26T11:08:37+0000	1466939317	2016-06-26 13:08:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The store is an absolute disgrace. I m aware it s going through refurbishment however there is no excuse for the staff smoking next to the trolley parks at the front of the store. Also no excuse for the trolley parks in the car park overflowing into the car park. I have two children one is 4 in October. The other 9 months. Could I find somewhere to leave my trolley without leaving my children unaccompanied in the car park? No I couldn t. This isn t the first time. I said in my precious message that I would probably not bother visiting tesco in cleckheaton anymore and I definitely will not after the two visits I ve had this week.					2016-06-26T09:24:28+0000	1466933068	2016-06-26 11:24:28	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Does it get binned? Or does it get sold on as second hand goods?   Technically it is second hand and I wouldn t fancy buying second hand mince which hasn t been stored at the correct temperature in somebody else s house and not forgetting the chance of it being tampered with.					2016-06-26T08:40:57+0000	1466930457	2016-06-26 10:40:57	1	8	1	0	9	8	3	5	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed a online order a couple of weeks ago as I couldn t get out as my little boy was really poorly with Scarlett fever.   I placed the order for delivery the following day but realised that I needed the shopping sooner than expected as I was running out of cold things for him rapidly  he had a very very high temperature and I was doing all I could to get it down. I telephoned and asked if there was any chance I could get it on the very first slot the following day and explained the situation. The staff very kindly moved my delivery slot forward to the same day so that he had his ice lollies and stuff for his temp and delivered it promptly  within 2 hours! The delivery manager ever called me the following day to see how my little boy was and to see if I needed anything else.  So a huge huge thank you to your wonderful staff.  I literally had no one to get to the shop for me and you were all amazing- Thank you! Xx					2016-06-26T08:03:24+0000	1466928204	2016-06-26 10:03:24	12	1	13	2	16	1	1	0	0	0	12	1	0	0	0	0	0

Myself and my husband were in store with the intent to buy a Amazon firestick  we approached staff at your customer service desk  to ask if they can check if you had any in stock as the shelf was empty. His reply was  6  but that s from midnight this morning so probably all gone if none there now.  We asked if he could check in the back.. Which he didn t seem keen  he did tell us that they were expecting another delivery at midnight tonight  but the store shuts then. To which he found amusing. Having been disappointed with this service we approach a young lady on a till  explained none on the shelf  6 in stock  and could she check the back  she went and asked  Bob!  Came back laughing saying  Bob doesn t know what they are!  . I explained they were for a TV  she went back to Bob and came back hysterical saying  he still doesn t know what they are!!  I told her that it didn t matter and left your store!  I m glad that your staff got some amusement out of your stores poor customer service and lack of effort in assisting us with a query and potential purchase.					2016-06-25T20:42:48+0000	1466887368	2016-06-25 22:42:48	1	5	3	0	8	4	2	2	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0

On opening these products all items were very wet  and soft  some of the potatoes had mildew on them. As we live 15miles away from your store  it was too far too take them back. I was very disappointed with the products and this is not the first time we have bought vegetables that are very wet. l just wanted to make you aware that it would appear to me that the packaging or the storage of these items is not up to standard. l look forward to receiving your reply.

A couple of days ago i visited a store with a view to buying a new tv. The first 2 stores were out of stock. At the 3rd store  they had the tv i wanted. Hooray! I took the ticket to the desk and the member of staff went out back to get it for us. 15 minuets later he came back out and said he couldnt find any but would speak to his manager about a discount on the display tv. We agreed  but as only 1 of the 15 or so tvs had a programme playing  i asked if the feed could be switched to the tv i wanted so i could check for any damage or dead pixels. This is where it went even more down hill. The guy serving us didnt know how to do it. And apparently neither did the other 6 members of the electrical department. Thats right.... 7 members of staff trying to get a picture up on the tv. After about 30 mins  my girlfriend suggested to them that they take the hdmi lead out of the working tv and plug that in. After another 10 mins and 4 staff not being able to do this  one of them comes out with a usb stick with a demo vid on it. He finally plugged it in  to find there were no files on it. Anyway  it was getting late so i gave in and just said id take the risk. 3 guys removed the tv from the wall  and one went to get a screwdriver to take the wall bracket off. 10 mins later he still hasnt come back  so i used my multitool and did it myself. Then they couldnt get it back in the box  so again i did it myself with them watching. I asked them if everything was there and they did check and assured me it was complete. Remote  yes. Stand  yes. Manuals  yes. Power cord  yes. Great. Lets go pay. The cashier then couldnt work out the 10% discount  so again  i told him what it was and the final cost. Took him a while to figure out how to use the till to put the new rate in  but he finally got there and i paid. Another nice man gave me a hand to take it to the car  as the girlfriend had got bored and did some shopping so had quite a few bags with her.  At 9pm  2 hours  yes  thats 2 hours after arriving at the store  we finally left with the tv. Got home went to plug it all in and guess what. The part of the tv stand that goes between the tv and the base of the stand was missing. Great. Called the store and after looking they said it wasnt there. So the discount i had for buying a used tv   was spent buying the adaptor for the stand. I shound have just gone to curry s and bought a brand new one from there!  Im just glad we didnt have our 2yr old daughter with us during this total farce. Thankyou tesco. Thankyou.					2016-06-25T19:10:39+0000	1466881839	2016-06-25 21:10:39	1	7	1	0	8	7	2	5	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have recently been on holiday to Norway and was pleased to see much food packaged in paper and card as oppose to plastic.  As I am sure you are aware a large amount of plastic enters the marine environment and has devestating and long lasting effects on marine life. Even a large portion of plastic that is recycle able  such as plastic bottles and pots  cannot be turned back in to the original product  therefore technically we do not recycle it but  down cycle  it. It inevitably end up in landfill where it can take hundreds of years to break down.  As I saw in other shops  products including pasta  cous cous  nuts  seeds  rice and many more came in resealable cardboard cartons. Bread came in paper bags  not plastic bags.  Paper and card are 100% recycle able  biodegradable and renewable  making them a cleaner greener choice.  Is it possible for you to switch to more sustainable packaging?

A staff member told me around three weeks ago he would do a store order for  6 cushions I wanted which were not in stock. I never heard from the store  went in twice to check on this - was told once they d let me know when they came in  second time NOBODY could be found to help me  according to Customer Service staff.   When I still heard nothing I went ahead and ordered them from Tesco Direct for pick up from this Banchory store. I received the message yesterday that the 6 cushions were ready to collect. I went in to the Banchory store this morning and after a long wait for assistance only two cushions could be found. It honestly seemed at that point that it would be left at that  but I had paid for 6  and so I persisted in trying to find out what to do then. I was told three different things -  only part order had come and they d follow    they may have been lost    they would have to re-order the 4 others   but nobody could confidently assure me there wouldn t be an issue if I signed for the part order.  Throughout all this everyone was adamant they were definitely not in the store. After 4 members of staff were involved  and a second check of the bonded warehouse was made at my urging - the other 4 were found.  Somebody had put them in the returns area  was the explanation apparently. Had I not stood my ground I may never have seen them  as it was agreed these might have been returned with having been put in the returns area.   Very unimpressed indeed  especially as the store is almost 12 miles away from my house and I had gone especially to get them today. I have made 4 trips to the store regarding these cushions  and that has cost me fuel and precious time. I was there almost 25 minutes this morning. This is NOT the service you advertise -  More Choice  Made Easy .  I hope this very unsatisfactory customer experience will be taken on board in an effort to prevent other customers experiencing the same poor service.					2016-06-25T18:26:33+0000	1466879193	2016-06-25 20:26:33	1	6	1	0	7	6	3	3	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can someone please help me before it is too late?					2016-06-25T14:58:49+0000	1466866729	2016-06-25 16:58:49	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A few days ago my boyfriend locked us out of our car in car park after shopping and my son s nappy had leaked through his jeans. A member of staff came out took me back in and gave me a new pair of trousers and a nappy to change him.  It s the small things that make love tesco! :)					2016-06-25T14:30:18+0000	1466865018	2016-06-25 16:30:18	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He keeps failing the screening questions it would appear. Please advise me  does the online application screen the entire document?. I am beginning to think that maybe it is his DOB or school grades that are affecting his application  and lack of success. It is so frustrating as he is very keen to gain employment with you  and our local store in Bishops Cleeve is always desperate for staff.  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.					2016-06-25T14:06:51+0000	1466863611	2016-06-25 16:06:51	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought a Hudl2 last year that the screen cracked on whilst on charge after 11 months. As I had taken the optional insurance  I was advised to speak to them. They arranged a repair and the Hudl was returned  fitted with a USED screen. I rang to complain  but was told it was policy...  Lo and behold  a couple of weeks later the same thing happened. I rang to speak to them  to be told that they had  paid out the maximum under the policy  really? For a faulty used screen?  Wrote to Tesco as advised they couldn t take a complaint either over the phone out via email  which is surprising as we live in the 21st century.   Anyway  they emailed back saying they aren t interested and passing the buck to Square Trade  the warranty company.   Looking online there are numerous instances of this happening  and I am disgusted that not only did it happen  but that they used a screen taken from a 2nd hand item that is known to suffer with this fault. The fact that they obviously don t warrant a repair for any length of time is also not good. As far as I m concerned the Hudl2 is nether for purpose  not of merchantable quality. I now have an extremely unhappy 4 yr old son who doesn t understand why his tablet has broken TWICE.   I d advise anyone to avoid purchasing electronic items from Tesco as their attitude to problems is woeful.					2016-06-25T14:02:08+0000	1466863328	2016-06-25 16:02:08	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My young son was very chatty and desperate to drags bags in for us but he wasn t impatient and really engaged with him. He went the extra mile for us and I wanted to make sure it didn t go unnoticed! He s part of the Exeter team and these are my delivery details.

I had a grocery delivery Tuesday morning at 10am in sandy  Bedfordshire I usually get a text after to rate the service but this time I didn t so thought I would say how wonderful the man was. My 2 year old is potty training this week that morning he had an accident just as I saw your driver pull up and I had just started giving my newborn his bottle so I quickly sorted my toddler and answered the door whilst feeding baby n he immediately said oh is it breakfast time shall I bring this through for you he walked past the mess in the living room and wasn t fussed over all the potty stuff he went to get more trays and I put the bottle down to start unloading the shopping with my 2 year old who loves that job when he came back with more trays he picked the bottle up passed it to me and started unloading everything with my boy helping him lift the heavy items on t the side .. Little things but it was just one of the moments where u think oh no typical everything happens at once and it s so much easier when you have a friendly helpful person to get even the smallest of things done for you thank you so much :)					2016-06-25T09:04:33+0000	1466845473	2016-06-25 11:04:33	13	3	13	0	16	3	1	2	0	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0

I phoned them up and the lady on the end said she would see what she would do.. shopping delivery yesterday evening 3 hrs later than we had originally booked it   no extra charge and a nice smiley face... and we here to receive the order.

Recently went into your Rugby Supermarket store to have a look around. As I was wondering round I noticed your online shoppers do the usual shopping. But what really bugged we was I saw a colleague of yours pick some bread up of the shelf on bakery. Walk straight in to the bakery  didn t was there hands  didn t put a hair net or hat on! She proceeding to slice the bread and walk back out. Correct me if I m wrong.. but I m pretty sure you can fail a food hygiene visit with both these things not done?   Can I ask what your policy is on this? Cause now I ve seen this. I m very reluctant to buy anything from your bakery or counters.

I had an email regarding my boost order and change of account details  I had done neither. Looked online and saw 80% of my vouchers had been used. Contacted clubcard and got it sorted as it looked like fraud. I looked at my account and saw the clubcards used on the orders ( there where several ) where not my current card number but were different and shorter numbers in some cases. So I m beginning to think it was not fraud but a system problem  maybe associated with the end to boost?					2016-06-25T07:17:11+0000	1466839031	2016-06-25 09:17:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m not very impressed by the fruit to juice ratio of Tesco Raspberries.  I opened the tin and drained the juice so I could use the fruit in a crumble for fathers day to find under half of tin was fruit and the rest was juice/syrup.  Now I know I can t expect the tin to be 100% full of fruit but this is ridiculous.  Please see the photo. You can see how much syrup there is. Do you think this is fair?

Only to find what was already a sore angry rash  now has open and chaffed areas on looking at the nappy there is exposed elastics on both sides which has come unstitched and has rubbed.   See pic.

That s twice in 2years..as if you don t make enough money because of pharmacists taking the risks to work for you and making your pharmacys run with your staff shortages..!! No reason or valid explanation has been given and shifts that have been booked many months ahead should be honoured at the same rate which Tesco also don t agree with.

Surely the expence of shipping  not to mention the environment ethics of transporting them from abroard  would make you want to look to buy from UK. I know that these items are available and at competitive prices in other stores so Why cant Tesco support the growers and farmers in the UK. Now that we are out of the EU  help build our nation but giving customers what we realy want and not what we are dictated to have.					2016-06-24T17:01:52+0000	1466787712	2016-06-24 19:01:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Rang me at 4.10 asking if I m in ( I arrived home at 4 on the dot from work) I said yes. When he arrived he went on to say he knew he d come early and was aware my booking slot was between 4 and 5pm but he needed to get it delivered and go and I should been here! Saying he d call his boss who said try again and I was lucky he said that because he would of just gone! (Bare in mind He was knocking on my door 10 min s EARLY TO MY DELIVERY SLOT) continued telling me if he didn t get back his boss is funny about paying him!!! How unprofessional and rude! So upset at the service I received made to feel guilty that i wasnt here BEFORE 10 to 4 when I was at work!					2016-06-24T16:12:03+0000	1466784723	2016-06-24 18:12:03	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in the process of purchasing alcohol when I was asked for ID  so I provided it  then my girlfriend was asked for ID even though she wasn t purchasing anything. She didn t have ID and we were refused the sale. Apparently it s policy to ask everyone for ID which would be fair enough except I was in the same store buying alcohol a few weeks earlier with my girlfriends 5 year old niece. I was asked for ID but the child wasn t. Where do you draw the line on asking for ID? My girlfriend is 23 and looks considerably older than her niece. This was very inconvenient and actually quite embarrassing as I was made to feel like I was purchasing alcohol for a minor. Thanks.					2016-06-24T13:26:06+0000	1466774766	2016-06-24 15:26:06	7	8	7	0	15	8	2	6	2	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

She is registered blind  having enough difficultly already needing to be guided and helped to shop...when we reached the till I was assisting her to pay for her goods  her card is chip and signature  the woman on the tills refused to allow her purchases  as the back of her card was not signed. I explained her predicament and the fact that she had just got married so the other cards were in a different name. By this time my SIL was already reduced to tears at the checkout  we were asked to go and withdraw cash to pay but this was also unfeasible as her cards do not have a PIN number. I asked for a manager who also said as tescos policy they wouldn t allow her to buy her shopping. Fortunately I was with her so I payed for the shopping myself. But I feel tescos handled this situation wrongly and by such discriminated against a disabled person! Makes me think twice about continuing to shop there!!!					2016-06-24T11:15:20+0000	1466766920	2016-06-24 13:15:20	1	29	7	0	36	28	8	20	41	0	1	1	0	0	0	4	0

Was just shopping at your Witham store  I bought several items including a bottle of wine.  I  was buying it  I was accompanied by my 19 year old daughter  who literally took the bottle from me to put in a bag! She wasn t paying for it  but because she touched it  the assistant demanded ID  which was in the car. I said  she wasn t buying it  I was  but this wasn t good enough. It was 1 bottle of prosecco! What would have happened if my 16 year old was with me  who doesn t possess official ID  and doesn t carry a passport to every Tesco trip! What would have happened..the same as today I guess  I wouldn t be able up but my shopping!! Totally ridiculous!! Please can I see a copy of your policy  and if it is as rigid as it seems  I ll take by business elsewhere..including my regular deliveries! Never had such a thing at your competitors!! üò†üò†üò†					2016-06-24T11:10:54+0000	1466766654	2016-06-24 13:10:54	2	23	3	0	26	22	4	18	8	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

Especially when I ve just seen your new advertisement. After only 2 months our television bought from yourselfs has a fault  after 2 months which I would and so would many class as still been new. So our new televisions is faulty and all tesco can offer is a repair  this is discussing and not a way to treat a customer.

Having the lights go from night time faded to bright and then back down  CONSTANTLY whilst shopping  is at the least annoying  but it has caused me a massive headache  I found it really hard to drive back home this evening tbh because of my headache and strained eyes. To find out at the checkout that this was happening last night and that a member of staff had to go home earlier because of headaches is terrible  that H&S matter are not being followed. Why wasn t this fixed? If someone had epilepsy they d be having a really bad time! Also sick to death of having to push cages out of the way so that I can either reach items I need or just to get my trolley down the aisle					2016-06-23T23:10:55+0000	1466723455	2016-06-24 01:10:55	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was on the tram home in Sheffield and saw what looked like an unconscious man in a wheelchair outside Tesco West Street with people walking on past him.   By the time I had registered what I had seen through the tram window it was too late for me to get off at that tram stop. I was really worried though so I found a phone number for Tesco and miraculously got through to a real person who called the store and sent staff out immediately to check on him.   I don t know how it all ended  maybe he was absolutely fine  maybe he did need medical help but I was just so  relieved to know that there was someone there to help him if he needed it.

When in Tesco on my way to work today  the cashier asked me if I had voted  to which I replied yes. She then asked me how I voted  to which I told her. I didn t think this would be a massive issue - we all have our own opinions and that s ok  it s the way of the world and we can t all agree 100% of the time can we?!   I was very shocked by this cashiers response which was along the lines of  Oh my god  why did you vote that way? Should ve voted this way!   Please tell me lovely Susan (this wasn t actually her name but I don t know her name so she s now called Susan!) why shouldn t I have voted the way I did? Because it s the wrong way according to you? Because it s not the same as the way you voted? I m intrigued as to why it infuriates you so much that I have my own mind and today I actively used it by voting for what I believe should happen?!   As you can see I have left out specifics regarding whether I voted in or out. This being because it s no ones business except mine  I am not going to judge anyone on the way they ve voted today  or their reasons behind it. We are all DIFFERENT and INDIVIDUAL and that is what make us  us.  Rule of thumb for me from now on will be that I will NOT discuss my voting decisions; not to friends  family or strangers.  So thanks  Susan  from Carmarthen Tesco for teaching me to keep my mouth shut from now on  because sadly the world will always judge or have something to say about your views and opinions.

I have found some old vouchers it says they run out next month. I have tried going on line to see if they haven t been used but it won t let me log in as it keeps saying my password is wrong so I have tried to do a new one and it keeps telling me my postcode is valid. If I take them into the shop will they be able to tell me? Thank you.					2016-06-23T20:05:58+0000	1466712358	2016-06-23 22:05:58	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today we celebrated my mothers 100th birthday and to make things easier I ordered the food to be delivered to her. When I went to serve it we found the salad was dated 22nd ( there was no mention of short date on the invoice) and it was compost. the second bag was in date but also compost. I had put a notice on the order stating that this was an important occasion but Tesco did not care. I phoned to complain and the guy I spoke to was lovely and agreed it was not right. I was refunded ¬£1.79 but the money means nothing. one of our party had to go out to Sainsbury and buy new salad. I won t be bothering with Tesco again. Even the cous cous salad I ordered did not come (did not notice that when I complained. So useless packer. Yes I am still angry.

We were not in a rush to have it delivered and selected Saturday the 25th of June as a delivery day as a Saturday is the only day where one of us is guaranteed to be home.  On Wednesday last week (22nd June) my partner received a call from Arrow XL (the courier) to say that they were at our house. They were rather rude about the fact that we weren t in and had to take our furniture back to the depot. They claim they don t deliver on a Saturday so why were we able to select this option?  Since then we have been plagued by phone calls from extremely rude staff in this useless company  the latest of which informed me that I had to pick one of two days next week for the delivery to take place. I told them that after 1pm on friday would be the only time that would suit us and I was told in a rather sharp reply that they cannot guarantee a time.  I would ask that you as a company take heed of this and of the terrible reviews Arrow XL receive on a daily basis and stop using them as a courier.  Cheers.					2016-06-23T17:35:19+0000	1466703319	2016-06-23 19:35:19	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Disappointed and discussed I am with Tesco store    Fox and Goose  hodge hill Birmingham. About three weeks ago I slipped on some washing up liquid which had been spilt on the floor at 31 weeks pregnat at the time and hearing a staff member openly tell  me she had told a cleaner to clean it up. Instead of putting down a wet sign or cornering it off it was left. I have been very worried about the safety of my unborn child as I experienced a lot of pain. Tesco store   coshill Rd Hodge Hill  have not even written to apologise for the accident which was clearly Thier fault. As a loyal customer as this is where I shopped daily /weekly I m very disappointed  in this store.					2016-06-23T17:22:03+0000	1466702523	2016-06-23 19:22:03	2	2	3	0	5	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0

There is also mould growing in certain places. Last night  an entire aisle was filled with water and no one had attempted to mop it up  they had simply thrown paper towels on it. The store smells like rotten fruit. There are never any plastic bags available at the self-check out  so you have to go and queue in the other check out just to get a bag  and the receipts are left to pile up everywhere as well. There are also dirty signs that are handwritten and mispelled on bits of disgusting paper  such as the signs on the self checkout  which say  card only . It s just generally really dirty and disgusting  and turns you off wanting to shop there.					2016-06-23T15:36:31+0000	1466696191	2016-06-23 17:36:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

While waiting at one checkout   the young man on the till behind was asking all his customers if they had voted yet.  Those saying yes were then asked how they voted.  Those saying no were told that it was very important to vote.  Ok so far   but when he then tells each one he voted to remain and why and then made statements about remaining that were wrong it s not good enough.  Whether in or out   checkout staff should not be politicising the checkout and spending political views especially those that are erroneous.					2016-06-23T14:51:25+0000	1466693485	2016-06-23 16:51:25	3	11	4	0	15	11	4	7	0	0	3	0	1	0	0	0	0

I have spent a total of 4 1/2 hrs waiting in and 1 1/2 hrs on phone calls  including veryfying with my bank that everything was ok. Tesco cannot work out that if I log in to my account with my password   and have the shopping delivered to my home address (they have the details - I have a clubcard after all)  that I still may be a thief. I was even told by the store manager that it looks suspicious that your second online order is so large!  I have had aphone call from the store where I was offered platitudes but with no sincerity. Customer services are keen to PM you so that it is not visible to everyone else. But best of all   after all of the inconvenience  and stress  they have offered me a ¬£10 giftcard  the shopping in the basket has gone up by ¬£20 alone  --- every little helps  well in this case it doesn t !					2016-06-23T13:22:05+0000	1466688125	2016-06-23 15:22:05	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I broke them in half and they re dry  hard inside  and not even flaky on the outside. Since when are croissants chewy without any flake and crisp? I get this isn t Paris but this is truly unacceptable. And when you ask in the shop if they were made today we get told yes which there is no way these were.

Last Friday my husband was doing the usual Friday afterschool shopping trip with or son (14  profound autism) he loves to shop  he waits all week to do it - it is actually used to help him manage his time and  wait for things  helping him also to manage behaviours and anxiety associated with wanting to buy things constantly. Accompanying him on this trip was his 8yr old brother. The trip started generally uneventfully apart from the couple who found looking at our son constantly an art in iteself  think it distracted them from thier shopping (i digress.... we as parents have travelled this road of educating the general public in autism awareness many times! ) The stinger on this trip was the securtiy guard  he was actually like some kind of shadow  he followed my hubby  my 14yr old (who is quite a vocal child with autism  lots of noises  hand flapping and pacing around shouting random words out for all to hear!) Tesco  this went on for the whole shopping trip  to the point that my husband asked him if there was an issue.The secuity guard was even waiting at the end of the checkout. Please note that our 14yr old needs 1-1 as he has no sense of danger so getting side tracked as a parent can be a problem! Lets not forget 8yr old brother who just coasts along on these trips and just  takes it on the chin  what random events occur when you have a brother with autism. My point here  I know i am rambling somewhat  the point I slept on last night was  we went back to store yesterday  me & my 8rd old. Do you know what he said!?  I hope the secutiry guard doesnt follow us mummy  he shouldnt though because we dont have my brother with us  Now Tesco  come on  this isnt the type of thing an 8yr old should be thinking! He has enough to deal with from the general public and their lack of awareness  I hope we have bought our children up to be kind  and compassionate little people who take in to account differences. Autism awareness  would the store like some tips? We have shopped in this store since our son with autism was a small boy  he has learnt to wait  be patient (doesnt always work) and to understand he cant always get what he wants  there have been times he has layed on the floor and flatly refused to move but generally staff  get it . I will point out here Mr Tesco that head office are aware of this event and they have asked the store to contact us  twice! it has been escalated but head office. They have so far not taken them up on this offer  sorry for the long post  I do feel better now I have got that off my chest! Look forward to hearing from you.					2016-06-23T08:37:29+0000	1466671049	2016-06-23 10:37:29	20	16	30	3	49	16	10	6	25	0	20	0	0	0	4	6	0

I would just like to praise this friendly  helpful gentleman.  Today he arrived a little early to find there was nobody home so he rang me and I explained I was on the school run but would be there within a few minutes. The man said don t worry he will start unloading and wait there for me to arrive. I got back at 9.05 and everything was all ready to bring in and the man was so enthusiastic and welcoming to my 2 year old.  He did not make me feel rushed or like an inconvenience and it was lovely to listen to his happy conversation and whistling.  So thankyou Mr Delivery man you cheered my day up! It s lovely to encounter someone so friendly and helpful.üòÄ					2016-06-23T08:30:28+0000	1466670628	2016-06-23 10:30:28	5	7	5	0	12	7	2	5	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

By go was I wrong. So fast forward two weeks and both shoes are utterly embarrassing  (here s me looking like a bad mum for sending her daughter to school in holey shoes!) So I popped into store this morning thinking surely after all the lovely adverts you ve done of late about no quibble exchanges I d be able to swap for another pair which may last the next couple of weeks till school ends. Alas the ladies on customer services decided not to be very helpful stating wear and tear (I exclaimed that surely a pair of shoes advertised as school wear should last longer than two weeks even if they were cheapies!?). They really werent very helpful and my daughter exclaimed about the rude looks i was getting from them! no...they wouldn t swap so I had to buy the 2nd pair in two weeks! Tesco is (or at least was) my go-to store for last minute essentials...and the weekly shop but think I might by shoe wear  elsewhere from now on!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13450249_10157062377435383_453145248829659541_n.jpg?oh=05ac4eb76eba9d2d096015fbf9c3a0fe&oe=58D904FE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13450249_10157062377435383_453145248829659541_n.jpg?oh=2bde1cf6cb05ddb76930d669e944ac5d&oe=58DFF8EB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157062377435383&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-23T08:21:42+0000	1466670102	2016-06-23 10:21:42	4	12	4	0	16	12	5	7	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can t believe in this day and age  2016  that sexism is so publicly promoted in your stores and it still exists at all.   I was just looking for some nice Cadbury mini rolls and I came across some gingerbread  men . Now this has deeply offended me as I have strong views that all genders should be equal  seeing a male dominated product is absolutely disgusting  as a product that s mainly aimed at kids it s sending out the wrong message that men are superior  this needs to change fast.  I will be looking forward to your response on this.

Having left my purse and all cards/money at home  missed my train by seconds and the next train didn t leave for another hour  I was feeling like I was having the worst day ever. They helped me work my phone so I could pay for some food using Android Pay  which I had never used before and didn t really know how it worked. I appreciated the moment of support after a slightly stressful evening :) Thanks!					2016-06-22T21:44:47+0000	1466631887	2016-06-22 23:44:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I first went to the till with milk and bread which came to ¬£2 the person behind the till did not even acknowledge me being there as he was too busy chatting to his colleague I asked him if he had a carrier bag but they didn t have any suitable bags as usual in this store I took my items away without my receipt as this is also common practise not to give you a receipt. As I was about to leave the store I remembered I needed Coca Cola which I brought back to the same person straight away as there was nobody else waiting at the till  I put my items which I first purchased back down by the till and said that I needed the cola as well   but still chatting to his friend and still without any acknowledgment I gave him the a further ¬£2 for the cola and his words to me was  You are joking mate and the rest  at this I checked the price on the cola and I said it was ¬£2 he said what about the bread and milk and I said I had already paid for that about 30 seconds ago and his colleague agreed that I had but the person serving said he hadn t served me. And to top it all off he said I over charge all the time my till is always up. The information on the bottom of my second till receipt was as follows   22/06/16. 21.35.  2382.  004.  6009.  6562  I look forward to your reply					2016-06-22T21:13:51+0000	1466630031	2016-06-22 23:13:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had an issue with a product that we no longer had the box for  and to make matters worse  I d lost the receipt!  I emailed the Facebook team and James  Jayne  Jake and Luciano all came to my aid over the last two days  working with some staff in the store to help get the issue sorted.  After an unsuccessful visit to the store last night  where I was told the staff couldn t help at all  I contacted the team again. They spoke to the duty manager who assured me that she would sort it out for me when I went back in  Sadly  when we went in to the Leytonstone store today  the duty manager in question wasn t around  but we spoke to Sue on customer services. She went WAY above and beyond to help us. She sorted everything out  searched our clubcard purchase history and found the item.  I ve never had such a positive customer services experience in my life  and I used to work in retail myself!  I d just like to commend her and the Facebook messenger staff mentioned for their help in this return.  Thanks  Sue!					2016-06-22T20:17:37+0000	1466626657	2016-06-22 22:17:37	4	6	4	0	10	6	4	2	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I order my children s school uniform from you every year. This year you have sent me garbage! First off the two jumpers pictured below are supposed to be the same....I ordered two for my boy at junior school-they are a completely different colour!  Secondly as the picture in the comments will show I ordered two for my youngest boy who is at infant school in the same size as he had last year as these still fit with growing room-and the ones you have sent me are tiny compared to his current ones.

My manager and I ordered a lot of food for an event we was having at work   it arrived   we called back the driver as he d forgotten alot of our products. . So much food! !! We ended up taking some home   I took one of the cous cous and one of the coleslaw. . I really didn t expect to take a piece of one of your employees too.. the 2 I took home hadn t been opened as we had ordered 2 and clearly  only need one each. .

I live in Wells Somerset and have a small child and it s convenient for me to pop into tesco about once a week. O handed my prescription into the pharmacy and they told me they could hold it for a bit. Went in today with a 7 months old with baby a double ear infection so was unhappy to be told they don t have it. I was shocked at this. They said someone must have collected it. I said they couldn t have. And the lady said I should call the doctor for another prescription. I said I was very unhappy because I know that no one has collected it. She said she could look through everything but would take a while and as I was concerned about it I said regardless of my grumpy baby I would wait. She assured me once again it would be a waste of my time to wait. Nevertheless I did. Within 15 minutes she came back with the prescription I had spend 30 minutes fighting to collect. Think this was very poor organisation and communication and will definalty not be using the pharmacy at any tesco store again!					2016-06-22T19:56:09+0000	1466625369	2016-06-22 21:56:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In addition to my previous complaints I saw a manager intentionally try to overcharge customers.   I found a sandwich that was meant to be marked down. The original price was ¬£1.50. It was  marked down  to ¬£1.78  because someone put its original price at ¬£2.00. I pointed it out to two employees there  one seemed concerned  the other joked saying  That s just the way things are.  The concerned employee was concerned. The joking one was the manager on duty for the evening. He not only didn t care  he thought it funny some customer was going to get cheated.   This same shop has overcharged me on sandwiches in the past because they didn t obscure the original bar code.   Please  will no one do anything about complaints there? I m buying my lunch at Centra tomorrow. They cost more than your over charge  but at least I know I ll be charged the correct price. Since it s a locally owned firm  they actually care what customers think. Anyone at Tesco that cares  doesn t seem to be in a responsible position.					2016-06-22T18:50:09+0000	1466621409	2016-06-22 20:50:09	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They saw through her disability at an interview and have now offered her two days a week paid! Proud is an understatement! Tesco s is definitely an equal opportunities employer!

Online order to Tesco for over ¬£400 mainly for drinks for my big birthday on Saturday. Waited until 2 hrs past my time slot before contacting customer services  who informed me it had been cancelled due to security isues  possibly my bank. Tesco did not bother to let me know this so waited in vain from 4 untill 7. They cancelled despite me logging in with my password  and using club card vouchers  and my registered home address. I rang my bank who assured me they had not cancelled the order. The customer service assistant reschedued the deliverary for today  and said there should be no problem. I have waited in again  and guess what- no delivary. Stll on the phone to customer services for the last 15 mins because the store has cancelled the order again!!!!!!! Plus to add insult to injury the estimated cost of the basket has gone up by ¬£20. Absolutley disgusting customer service					2016-06-22T16:43:45+0000	1466613825	2016-06-22 18:43:45	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I love this tesco but today you are about to lose a customer!!  For the past year I have used your shop online. 70% of the time your always late over the allotted time. Never once complained considering delivery could be ¬£5 but for the next hour it s ¬£1 üôÑ I paid the ¬£5 to get it delivered then as I m busy!! And still charged for the time slot i chose when it came out of those hours!!  Well today  I done a online shop last night to arrive between 10-11 am today and I m still waiting for said order. Iv had to cancel all my plans to sit around waiting for an order I m still waiting on baring in mind there is no food etc in the house hence an order!! And can t go out as no time has been given! Cheers for ruining a very rare day of which again I had plans!! I received a phone call this morning to say your truck had broken down and you ll be with me soon as you can! No doubt you have given everyone else there orders so why am I still waiting surly I should be a priority rather then the 10 customers after me.  I m sorry but this is disgusting that you expect people to wait around!! I work full time 14hr days 7days a week! And you can t deliver on time.  From one very unhappy customer!!!					2016-06-22T16:43:10+0000	1466613790	2016-06-22 18:43:10	0	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

My 3yr old daughter has special needs and amongst other things she is very flexible in her joints  so trying to find her a gingham school dress that didn t mean I was having to bend and manipulate her arms through has been hard. Thankfully I ve discovered your fully buttoned dress which is so pretty and works perfectly. It would be amazing if you also started selling poppered baby vests in bigger sizes as there are still 3yr olds (and older) in nappies that that need them - Look at how well the specialist range at M&S are doing! Since they introduced it in March they re constantly selling out! Many thanks again  Jess					2016-06-22T16:36:19+0000	1466613379	2016-06-22 18:36:19	3	4	3	0	7	4	3	1	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please stop blocking my drive!!!  today I waited just over 15min to get on my own driveway after a very long day at work. There is ample room to park inside this flat block are or on the road. This driver keeps doing this without fail of causing a nuances my property and driveway is over the entrance to the driveway n  has a sign saying please don t block   most other food delivery vans reverse in n don t cause a problem.  The bad factor is every time he does it he doesn t even bother to apologise he just jumps in.  Surely good customer service can stretch to sorry ill be out of you way.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13510874_10157182689100195_7929711273798820985_n.jpg?oh=1ad9ab153226c2a05bac5cf9ff24fb8c&oe=59233249	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13510874_10157182689100195_7929711273798820985_n.jpg?oh=e195022cb42577520819706ad61325eb&oe=59237544	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157182689100195&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-22T15:53:52+0000	1466610832	2016-06-22 17:53:52	4	15	5	3	23	15	8	7	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	1	0

Tesco‚Äôs Opticians  Addlestone I have worn varifocals for over 20 years and have been a customer of Vision Express Opticians for 15 years. I recently had my cataracts removed and now only require reading glasses. I had an eye test at Vision Express but wasn‚Äôt happy with the quote they gave me for a new pair of reading glasses  so I took my prescription along to Tesco‚Äôs Opticians in Addlestone  Surrey. I was delighted with their quote  especially when I was told that I would receive a 2nd pair free  so  on 8th June  I went ahead and ordered reading specs with transition lenses. I picked them up on 15th June  they were slack and weren‚Äôt fitting very well  the assistant held them over a machine that heated them up and I watched while she bent the arms round to make them tighter. I don‚Äôt wear the glasses very often  only when I am looking at my computer or reading but after the second day  they still weren‚Äôt fitting and slipping down on my face  I then noticed the arm on one pair was loose  so I carefully placed them back in their case and didn‚Äôt wear them again until I could manage back into Tesco today to get them fixed.  The same assistant  again held them over the machine and bent the arms to make the glasses tighter on my face  she then tightened up the loose arm. I asked her to tighten it up more because the arm was still loose. She had a look then told me that the arm was damaged so couldn‚Äôt be tightened up properly.  As the glasses were only a week old  I expected her to apologise and tell me that she would get it repaired for me  but she had the audacity to accuse me of causing the damage  she actually said I must have sat on them! I was so taken aback  then another older lady came in and asked if any small hands had been touching them  I told her there was only my husband and myself at home (we are both senior citizens)  and  in any case  no-one  but me  touches my glasses. She then said they had been forced  to which I replied  ‚ÄòWell  the only person that has been forcing and bending the arms is your assistant!‚Äô  Then the older lady said  ‚ÄòThe end of the arms look like they‚Äôve been chewed!‚Äô She showed them to her assistant  and ignoring me  she repeated  ‚ÄòThey‚Äôve been chewed!‚Äô  By this time I was really upset with their absurd accusations  and replied  ‚ÄòSo now you are accusing me of sitting on my glasses then chewing them? They rudely replied that they will send them back and the manufacturer will be able to tell! Quite honestly  I am speechless at how unhelpful and unpleasant both these ladies were! I have been a very good customer of Tesco‚Äôs stores both at Brooklands and Addlestone for 15 years and have never known any assistants or customer services to be so rude! They need serious training in customer relations! Initially  I was singing the praises of Tesco‚Äôs Opticians and the great prices  I was recommending them to my friends  but now I am thoroughly disillusioned and disgusted  your Optician s after sales service is appalling!					2016-06-22T15:09:44+0000	1466608184	2016-06-22 17:09:44	0	13	0	0	13	13	5	8	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No point complaining in store as the  customer service  staff have no idea what that means. Also  a lot of the boxes were ripped open/crushed and not just the rice crispies in the cereal section. There was also no loose  fresh brocolli so have been conned into paying for a lot of stalk I dont want in a pre packed portion. The dates on a lot of fresh produce are useless  I do a weekly shop and would like  just once in a while to find some coleslaw in the size I require with more than 1 day use by date on it would be nice. Might seem petty  but it really does grate week after week...and now the out of date cereal has prompted me to remember to check the dates on longer life products again  as this has happened in this store numerous times.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13508951_10210294478217611_4991968678157436359_n.jpg?oh=db518835f8823b5a836b7c7a96097fe3&oe=58DF382D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13508951_10210294478217611_4991968678157436359_n.jpg?oh=52ad032507dcd5ff9f01c1c06000c6b2&oe=58E03320	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210294478217611&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-22T13:53:50+0000	1466603630	2016-06-22 15:53:50	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know tescos have changed the way they make their nappies now - my son also gets those horrid jelly crystal blobs in his nappies like many other children - but has the same thing happened to their pull up nappies? I ve always relied on Tesco nappies for all 3 of my children  as they used to be so much better than the big branded ones. But if their pull up nappies are doing the same thing I don t know where to buy from :/ Can any other parents help?

These are in a pack of four which are designed to be cooked in the packet. I don t want to eat 4 corn on the cob in one sitting nor do I want them covered in butter. I have asked at my local store and they couldn t confirm whether they where continuing to stock them or not. I know that you sell them fresh and I have been buying those but I prefer the convenience of having a bag in my freezer that I can just dip into if me or my son fancy A corn on the cob with our tea.					2016-06-22T13:16:15+0000	1466601375	2016-06-22 15:16:15	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I complain I m told yes they are. Aware of the problem and it s being sorted  but for 3 yrs come on Tescos who are you trying to kid?

I picked up the wrap in your Bognor Regis petrol station on my way to work ( staff in there are lovely and nothing to do with them)  I opened the packaging to be greatly disappointed by the lack of filling in my lunch. I have attached some images but to be honest the images make it look better that it is!  Even in a ¬£3.00 meal deal this is ridiculous.  Looking on the package for an email address to contact you I notice that the chicken comes from Thailand!?!! So you ve gone cheap on the chicken yet I still get about 5ps worth in my lunch today?  I am really not happy  I would be happy to take this back to a Tesco store however I do not have anything else for my lunch and not willing to starve today  so I ate the near empty wrap.  I await your reply.

I ve just opened a pot of Ambrosia rice pudding for my 3yr old to eat and was surprised to not find any rice in it! I opened a second pot (out of a four pack) and found only 7 grains of rice!!!! I haven t opened the other two but they feel watery when I shake them. I don t have the receipt  but I guess I can find it if I search through my clubcard account? I can t very well take the plates of  rice  pudding back to the shop ...

Home delivery was the only option through Arrow XL  the courier that you use. I ve just looked at Arrow XL s facebook page and their reviews are shocking! Why would you use such a rubbish courier?? This is the review I have just left them:  I received a text confirming my package would be delivered yesterday. No delivery came. Contacted arrow via its online chat this morning to be told my package was still with Tesco. Asked why the tracking number I was given shows my parcel is in their warehouse. Chat advisor Olivia told me they have only received the  paperwork . Strange as their website shows my package is  loaded ready for delivery . I asked if it was Arrow or Tesco that sent me the text telling me my delivery details. She said it could of been either. So I have no idea where my package is but I don t believe for one minute that a delivery slot would of been generated when arrow only received the paperwork for my delivery. Why would arrow receive only paperwork!! If it doesn t make sense its usually a load of rubbish right!?! At the end of the chat I attempted to forward the chat to myself and my husband using the tool arrow provide but it hasn t been received at either email address!!  Thanks Tesco!!					2016-06-22T10:46:06+0000	1466592366	2016-06-22 12:46:06	1	8	1	1	10	8	3	5	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He paid on the card and we didn t realise until we got home that he had been charged for two lots of lager not one. I emailed Tesco and explained and sent a photo of the receipt and I immediately got a kind reply stating how sorry they were for the mistake and promised to send us a Tesco money card for ¬£22.00.  The money card arrived through the post soon after. Excellent customer service  thank you again.					2016-06-22T09:20:37+0000	1466587237	2016-06-22 11:20:37	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When he brought it home we discovered it was full of  mold. We sent him back with it to exchange it   however they shop wouldn t exchange it since he didnt have the receipt   now i understand that your policy no receipt no exchange.  What i need to point out is that this bread was best before the 14th of june  which at this stage is 5 days out of date. It really should be on the shelf for sale. my thoughts was what if somebody with impaired sight or a young child had opened that bread   please ensure that your staff do date checks on your products which they clearly aren t doing at the moment.					2016-06-22T09:00:05+0000	1466586005	2016-06-22 11:00:05	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can I please ask you to amend your website to make it more obvious that the delivery save is taken out in one lump sum. As your website says ¬£5 a week I assumed this money would be taken at ¬£5 a week. I have just checked my bank and the whole ¬£60 has been taken. This couldn t have come at a worse time and now I will be facing charges from my bank!! Had I known it would be taken in one lump I wouldn t have signed up. With a 1 year old and on a part time wage I don t have that kind of money every month.

The more I think about it  the more I wanted to say thank you bcoz I m not sure I did at the time.  My mum has just started radiotherapy this week  and has been unable to drive for a while so I often take her shopping.. As well as having a baby 12weeks ago.  I walked into the store yesterday holding my baby facing out with one arm (very nosy and been in the car a long time).. And pushing my pushchair with the other. My mum was following with a trolley. There were 2 team members stood just inside the door who approached me and asked me if I was ok? I look like I have my hands full  can they help with my shopping? Or would I like them to take care of my push chair whilst I shop? I declined as mum was with me  but I just thought.. How lovely! They wouldn t of wanted to see me struggle. I have often managed a pushchair and a basket in other supermarkets and no1 has batted an eyelid.  People are quick to complain.. So I thought I d compliment! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª					2016-06-22T07:02:06+0000	1466578926	2016-06-22 09:02:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I neeeded the stuff for tomorrow morning  so abandoning the shopping wasn t an option but it came oh  so close. First was the music. I don t mind music playing instore and I appreciate it fills the void for staff working a long night shift but the brain piercingly squeaky and distorted PA system had my nerves on edge by the time I was halfway round. How the staff put up with it I don t understand. Grabbed the four items I wanted and headed for the checkouts.   I asked the lass supervising the tills if there was a manned till. She said no and indicated the self service block  to which I objected.  I am sure I heard her say  It isn t difficult . Yes  it s not difficult at all but it is highly unpleasant. Four items and two of them needed her to come and authorise the transaction anyway. Unfortunately I really needed the stuff but next time  if self service tills are the ony alternative  the goods get abandoned and I walk out.					2016-06-21T23:58:57+0000	1466553537	2016-06-22 01:58:57	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Reponses to every other complaint on here but not one where your staff caused over ¬£2 800 worth of damage to my car!! Tescos Folkestone aren t admitting anything or returning phone calls customer services on the phone don t seem to be doing much as all I got was a snotty voicemail. How about u guys just pay for the damage seeing as my car was parked at the time yr driver hit it so can only be his fault!!! U can start by acknowledging my complaint!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13450281_10153765623366325_5116261652320919413_n.jpg?oh=483c1b08826d36873a62c97ee3a9dd60&oe=58EAB629	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13450281_10153765623366325_5116261652320919413_n.jpg?oh=396181db920ed62ecec055d2c2ba39ea&oe=58E79524	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153765623366325&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-21T22:22:38+0000	1466547758	2016-06-22 00:22:38	3	11	3	0	14	10	4	6	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter loves My little pony and as a reward we purchased on Sunday these knickers. Today she wore them for the first time and to my horror tonight before we took a bath I found welts on her skin. She is 3 years old and has been wearing 4-5Years since feb. She hasnt gotten fat because not long ago we purchased F&F boxer knickers to our surprise these were too big! Please explain how is that branded goods like Hasbro mlp is too small for her and the F&F too big?mind you theyre supposed to be the same size?? My child isnt fat so why do we pay extra for these name brands and they wedge into the child s skin????					2016-06-21T20:56:22+0000	1466542582	2016-06-21 22:56:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Its expiry date was tomorrow (as shown on pic). It was good that i decided to eat as soon as he got home and saw they were rotten. If i had left it till tomorrow i would have had to think that its not the Tesco that is selling rotten fruits to public (which actually is the fact) but due to the date before use. How am I supposed to eat all those rotten mangoes!! I always shopped with Tescos but i will have to think from now on. I am not happy with your service.

The receipt clearly states that it is a Tesco guarantee  however 2 years after I got it the television broke. For the past month I have visited several tescos who have given me a different number not tesco  and on phoning this number the man I have spoken to was very rude and told me I have to get it fixed myself and pay for the repair and then claim the money back from them. On visiting your irvin store Scott at the electrical desk gave me fabulous customer service and tried to help but was told tesco s hands are tied. I strongly feel that I have been miss sold this as i bought the television under the impression I was getting it with a 5 year guarantee with tesco  your offer is very misleading and I feel you should let your customers know what they are getting. I cannot afford to get it fixed so this guarantee is useless to me					2016-06-21T19:59:56+0000	1466539196	2016-06-21 21:59:56	4	4	5	0	9	4	2	2	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	1	0

See picture below and the same thing again today opening another pack and only getting 2 bananas worth out of it. I was not going to take all this gunk and trek into tesco with it. Is there any way of having some sort of refund? Thanks					2016-06-21T19:40:37+0000	1466538037	2016-06-21 21:40:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not so much with yourselves but with some of your inconsiderate customers.   It concerns your trollies. Specifically  the dual child seat twin trollies.  These trollies are great  allowing us to shop one adult per two children with ease! However they are very limited and do not require persons to put in a pound to use them and thus are subject to misuse.   On numerous occasions  almost every visit to be honest  we have witnessed people using these trollies  not only with single kids  but with no kids! We observe people using the child seats to separate their veg  their bakery items  hang clothes  heck even to organise their wine! White in the left seat red in the right! I do not joke!   I assume these people think they are clever  getting away without having to have a pound coin but I think it rather inconsiderate of others. I m sure some innocently did not have a pound coin on them  or forgot their little keyring jobby! Most  I m certain  know jam well what they do  as these trollies are stacked out of the way to the side of the store right to the back! Other people probably don t even know they are there!   You see we have two year old twins. When me and the wife visit the store together and no twin trollies are available it is not so much of a problem  well not for us anyway  we just take a normal trolley and a child each and off we go  getting in everyone s way as we go  taking up double the space in the aisles I m sure annoying many others. It is still however slightly frustrating to see others with no children using them even though its not a massive inconvenience to us.    It is when my wife wishes to visit alone with the girls and there are no twin trollies. This is where we have a big problem. As you can imagine a shopping trip alone with two year old twins is difficult enough even with the twin trolly  nigh on impossible without!! I challenge you to try it!  It s got to a point where my wife literally feels that she cannot visit the store alone through fear of arriving only to find that no twin trollies are available.   I must stress that this complaint is not entirely directed at yourselves  mostly so at the people misusing these trollies.   I must convey deep and utter disappointment to these people and their lack of thought for others.   I ve been close to stopping these people in the middle of the store to demand they swap trollies! If we encounter many more I feel I may snap and start doing so!!   All sattire aside there must be a remedy?   I know it maybe of massive cost for you to implement the idea  but I  as I m sure the other tens of thousands of parents of twins up and down the country  would happily have to put a ¬£2 coin in these trollies  to prevent their missuse. We already pay double for everything else baby related! Why not the trollies too!  Yours respectfully   Ben Austin  Proud father of beautiful twin girls					2016-06-21T18:23:01+0000	1466533381	2016-06-21 20:23:01	20	15	20	3	38	14	2	12	9	0	17	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please be careful if you use them for your children.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13501995_625429960947251_1389613417153930645_n.jpg?oh=5dd4e0d0ed13896a0c7a04cd543caacc&oe=591F84B6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13501995_625429960947251_1389613417153930645_n.jpg?oh=61b5942c982011a826523d4c5e5b9804&oe=58E2BA49	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=625429960947251&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-21T15:29:03+0000	1466522943	2016-06-21 17:29:03	2	3	3	7	13	3	2	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

This is your only baby changing room which I had to force my way into to change my baby. As you can see the customer wheelchairs are being stored in here meaning you have to climb over the bins to reach the baby change table. This also meant I was unable to breastfeed my baby as there was not enough room to move. Opposite the baby change is the staff only area where 4 members of your staff passed me without helping. Not only is this completely unsuitable for customers with young children but how are disabled customers going to use the wheelchairs if they are in the baby changing room?

However after receiving your  tesco loves baby  nappies I have concluded that Tesco actually does not love babies!!! Opened up a fresh pack of nappies to find the first four were ripped to shreds  never mind I thought  it was only a few... Popped the fifth nappy on my daughter and ten minutes later it fell apart  (the picture is actually the least ripped one!). Tried the next... And the next... And the next but no  Tesco does not love babies at all.. Moved on to the next pack and exactly the same thing.

There is ample room at the top of the road to have pulled the vehicle over  or even parking it slightly over to the side could have allowed my car to pass. My father is currently receiving treatment for terminal cancer  and was forced to hobble back home in extreme pain as I could not drive him to the door. This is absolutely disgusting. It was not just my parents house that was inaccessible  there are a number of houses that would have had their access blocked here  with many of the neighbours being elderly. What would have happened had an ambulance needed to get to them? Or any other emergency service? The driver was absent from the vehicle for a good few minutes and I sounded my horn twice  to no response. As you can see from the photograph  the empty crates were left outside of the van  so I m not sure how long it had been there prior to me pulling up. This is most unacceptable and your drivers need to show more courtesy and respect to those living nearby to where they are delivering.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13495151_10154249204291530_8840947653598799664_n.jpg?oh=be9232b8dca836878763c4c77a96c541&oe=58DC634B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13495151_10154249204291530_8840947653598799664_n.jpg?oh=9e3640e93fda321a3f138cccd3edf0a1&oe=58E3773F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154249204291530&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-21T13:36:16+0000	1466516176	2016-06-21 15:36:16	0	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	4	0

I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with all three varieties. The  Dark  was bitter and left a horrid aftertaste  the  Milk  was bland and tasteless  and the  White  was just plain awful. Overall I would describe all three as revolting and I certainly won t be wasting my hard earned money on them again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13516622_10210047760617580_5488792636460891092_n.jpg?oh=3ca6f86ebc6c97d746397984eaab47dd&oe=58E42F52	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13516622_10210047760617580_5488792636460891092_n.jpg?oh=fc5a2eb2e6dc366bd9b8e0aa59007c73&oe=58E70D5F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210047760617580&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-21T11:46:35+0000	1466509595	2016-06-21 13:46:35	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Thankfully I m vigilant and have checked the spout of my beer bottle before drinking but if I hadn t I could have cut my mouth open badly. Extremely annoyed as any one of my friends could have drank this and injured themselves. Do not sell beer unless it it a safe quality. Completely unacceptable...

My parents bought my 8 year old son a hudl 2 for Christmas; when buying it my dad specifically queried the reports that the first one kept going wrong and was assured that the issues had been resolved. However 6 months later the hudl 2 we have doesn t charge !!!! And unless we can prove that the TESCO hudl was bought in TESCO nothing can be done. We go away next week and the tablet was for occasions like this - so now I have a distraught 8 year old and me looking at having to find ¬£100 plus to get an alternative that will work!

We couldn t find the receipt and so knew we would only be able to get an exchange  which is what we wanted anyway. Michelle was really helpful in finding our receipt on your system using my partner s debit card details; some assistants today would have just told me  no  not without a receipt  and not bothered to go the extra mile. I have walked out with a new pair of shorts for my fianc√©  a few bits for me and a smile. Please could you pass my comments onto her manager? I know that some would say she was  just doing her job   but her service was really great and it is always nice to be recognised for hardwork and commitment.   Thank you Michelle.

Amongst these 15 people  3 of them had your wire basket and a small trolley. The baskets were full up  and the trolley was half filled up  with raspberries. You should know this is a health and safety issue for the employee due to the mobs of people around him  as he is not cornered off. I ve observed this several times. And also I believe  you ve got have a limit of how many items customers can have of reduced products. It gives nobody a fair chance. This is ludicrous  as there is always a mob. Tesco s should ensure safety of there staff and respect for other customer s.					2016-06-20T19:45:11+0000	1466451911	2016-06-20 21:45:11	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Could you please clarify the following points: An extract from your Returns Policy states  We ask that perishable food items are returned within their use by date.  First of all what items are included  does this limit itself to raw fruit and veg  or does it include the wider definition: meat  poultry  fish  milk  eggs  and cooked foods? Also  what happens to the returned perishable food items? Do they go back on sale? If so  how can you assure customers that proper refrigeration protocols have not been compromised  especially for ready to eat items  which are naturally the most vulnerable?					2016-06-20T19:39:43+0000	1466451583	2016-06-20 21:39:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went into the store for replacements and returned to the customer service desk when I was met by a colleague of the lady currently dealing with me and was questioned then told it was my fault that I had bought strawberries that go out of date in five hours...   I worked for Tesco circa 2004 when you opened your first store here and I m not being funny but to say that she works on customer service she needs some training and for you to put it on the  Team 5  about your new policy as I doubt she s bothered to read it because why would she have to? She acted like she owned the store!  The strawberries were originally ¬£3 per tray  I purchased two = ¬£6. They are now ¬£2.75 and even though they are priced ¬£3 she had the cheek to charge 50p and did not issue a receipt even though I had paid extra which I think is disgusting.

One item purchased recently was mincemeat which previously I would have purchased the  value range  & have never had a problem with either the quality OR the taste  I found that the above store no longer are stocking this & opted for the next cheapest option which I found absolutely awful. It was very fatty & gristly & would NEVER purchase again! Also I find it very difficult to purchase goods with more than a couple of days left on  use by dates  - not so in other supermarkets. So with this in mind Tesco you have lost another customer who has shopped in your stores for many years.					2016-06-20T18:07:24+0000	1466446044	2016-06-20 20:07:24	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I requested for a manager to call me as I believe this is a problem that would easily be rectified  but unfortunately this again has not happened.					2016-06-20T16:14:46+0000	1466439286	2016-06-20 18:14:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The tesco clubcard key ring states on it  If found  please hand into a Tesco Store and we will do our best to return it     I discovered today when enquiring if my lost keys had been handed in  that  doing your best  is keeping them in a drawer on the off chance that someone happens to ask if you have them.  I was told there was no central recording system so I would have to go to each individual Tesco store and see if they have my keys????  A person could hand them in to a store in a  totally different part of the country from where they were found and I would have no way of getting them back. You should absolutely have a central logging system and after a set time  hand to the police who already have a system for contacting those who have registered lost keys.  Or you could get the tesco customers details from the clubcard so why can t you proactively contact the person informing them you have their keys?  I would now actively discourage anyone from having the clubcard key ring on their keys as it appears that it actually decreases your chances of getting lost keys back.  Very irresponsible of Tesco to so publicly offer a  key return service  that is completely unsatisfactory.  I would appreciate any help in working out if any of your Tesco stores happen to have had my keys handed in??					2016-06-20T15:45:12+0000	1466437512	2016-06-20 17:45:12	0	5	1	0	6	5	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

The label clearly says there is 11% chicken breast within the pot so I m just wondering if someone has found the other 11% in their pot.   It was still lovely but quite disappointed with the lack of chicken.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13442311_1112137222141778_5911332392941853133_n.jpg?oh=c716a38dc815065850dee9f3f210147e&oe=58DA1B43	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13442311_1112137222141778_5911332392941853133_n.jpg?oh=b7965c5e7de895dee42d7a4b05dab952&oe=591CD956	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1112137222141778&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-20T15:20:43+0000	1466436043	2016-06-20 17:20:43	7	11	7	0	18	7	3	4	4	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are all big bagel lovers  me and my two brothers have many childhood memories featuring this bready snack  they have always been a part of our lives. Perhaps we got this passion from our equally passionate parents. Anyway  enough about me. Upon my return  I realised there was 6 bagels in the pack  although the packaging clearly stated 5. I immediately felt sick to my stomach  knowing the heated debates this would cause; who would get the additional bagel? I tried to conceal the pack under my jacket and leave before it was too late but  as if by magic  my mother appeared. I swear  she can smell a good bagel a mile off. Anyway  one thing led to another and now I am sleeping in my car as I refused to share the extra bagel. Tesco  not only did you lie to me about the quantity of bagels  you tore my family apart and took away any kind of stability from my life. A little side note- loving the discounted kettle chips.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13442390_10209949697728358_7056651536764157113_n.jpg?oh=a733be4c8abf445e60751b3fa2b6e672&oe=592317BB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13442390_10209949697728358_7056651536764157113_n.jpg?oh=76263e009e26e69c20088c69e99c337d&oe=58DF8EB6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209949697728358&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-20T14:59:20+0000	1466434760	2016-06-20 16:59:20	101	7	113	11	131	6	6	0	28	0	100	0	0	12	0	0	0

I am going to now use a different company I am tired of Tesco I never thought I d say it and I m tired of being fobbed off!

Everytime made to feel like a criminal. Made to feel as though I had been dishonest. Made to feel embarrassed. You should know by now of when the system needs checking and to use it as a cover to search through my shopping bags is pathetic and underhanded. I will no longer be shopping in your stores.

Considering myself relatively well informed I make a point of checking many food labels before purchasing. However when buying your frozen Tesco Diced Chicken Breast Fillet 600G I was unpleasantly shocked to discover that it contains around 1gram of added dextose for every 100g of chicken. Needless to say raw chicken is not the kind of item that I expected to find containing hidden sugar.					2016-06-20T11:53:12+0000	1466423592	2016-06-20 13:53:12	1	10	1	0	11	10	8	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have attached pictures of my babies bath temperature hippo. I put it in the bath myself every bath time to check the temp is ok for him  so it s not just chucked in. When I last went to use it I noticed brown water in the bath  luckily I looked before putting the baby in as it s battery acid. As you can see from the pics the battery acid has leaked and worked it s way out through the cover. This is meant for use in the nursery or in the bath so no way should it of got like this especially when I m the one putting it in not my son chucking it.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13495028_10154142026955803_2814722888093738655_n.jpg?oh=570f956cc99993d22a24047c9242a83b&oe=59213BB4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13495028_10154142026955803_2814722888093738655_n.jpg?oh=540362bd2332f199c33d7ed6b1ccdaec&oe=58D5D0B9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154142026955803&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-20T11:21:07+0000	1466421667	2016-06-20 13:21:07	0	5	0	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have used your Contact Us service numerous times to no avail. Even your staff have said they have raised the issue time and time again but no one is listening. For your information this has been caused because the whole car park is a problem. A number of people including me have been hit by cars attempting to reverse out as there is NO pedestrian path. Recently someone knocked out a section of a side wall so pedestrians could gain access through the carpark but this is even more dangerous. Someone in Tesco needs to get of their backside and come and look at the problem.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q89/s130x130/13445811_10206770297552091_7395420533782588706_n.jpg?oh=7aae51b0f65bdc499444b958040fd0b6&oe=58EA511C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q89/s720x720/13445811_10206770297552091_7395420533782588706_n.jpg?oh=d0f76823b5d1c7d2be517cd45ce56662&oe=58D7D0F0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206770297552091&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-20T10:53:53+0000	1466420033	2016-06-20 12:53:53	7	11	7	0	18	11	7	4	8	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

My shopping this morning was not due for delivery until the 11-12midday time slot.

I bought a pack of red seedless grapes from your Abingdon store and today open them to find mould on over half of the grapes inside! The best before date states 22 June (this was my only option in store)  Seriously unhappy as its a waste of my time buying them and they aren t cheap! It s disgusting that they are packed clearly not fit for sale. The mould is only visible once the pack is opened otherwise I would have not bought them in the first place.  Really unhappy customer!

Spotted some in my local superstore  sadly they were all uprooted and half dead. I was willing to give them a try  but not for ¬£14 so i took the bowl of cacti to customer service and asked what the price would be on this  considering the sheer amount of damage. She said she would have to ask someone else  took the bowl of cacti and returned 5 minites later with a new bowl of different cacti.. thats not what i asked or wanted. Now my question is what happens to the plants now? I was willing to pay (admittedly at a cut price) for those and now what? They just get chucked away? I am very dissapointed. i wont be shopping with you untill the pain of my cacti loss subsides.					2016-06-20T10:01:34+0000	1466416894	2016-06-20 12:01:34	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

At the moment it seems to be at best a stock level of minus one.   Funny it wasn t out of stock when I ordered it.  A previous days leave - wasted.  Time dismantling the old bed and clearing the room - wasted.

Soooooooooooo angry  and as for the pitiful ¬£15 moneycard gesture  cost me ¬£16 to return it as I was requested to return the chicken for testing  bloody disgraceful on top of the rude customer service I received on the day I returned the item as requested  Tesco  u could not organise a pish up in a brewery					2016-06-20T09:56:07+0000	1466416567	2016-06-20 11:56:07	1	14	1	0	15	14	2	12	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of my friends had told me about a Cider I have never seen or heard about this weekend he said he had got it from Tesco so off I went. Started with Sale Tesco  no sorry said the girl at customer service we dont sell it. Off I went to Baguley no not in there either. I know I thought Tesco in Altrincham will have it. Oh what an idiot I am to think they could sell it and the staff be helpful  ha a joke. I asked at customer sevice the computer said no. Then a young man was supposed to have gone and had a look when he came back he asked me if I d seen any others like it!!! I thought he d gone to look? And not one of the customer service in Sale or Altrincham offered to ring other stores to see if they had the cider. I ended going to Irlam where my friend had bought his. Such bad customer service and you wonder why people have stopped shopping with you.

I have complained  and no one has gotten back to me! I am appalled by the service! I have awful eye sight  without my glasses I have very little vision  and they know this! I have been misold glasses  had my lenses put into display models because they weren t aligned  and the third pair I received had a scratched lense  which caused me blurred vision  and headaches! I am still awaiting for this new pair! Does nobody check the glasses? I am currently wearing a pair that don t sit correctly  give me double vision when I look down  causing me to fall and trip! I done even want the glasses from you now! I m fed up  and exhausted with dealing with you!					2016-06-19T20:06:33+0000	1466366793	2016-06-19 22:06:33	8	43	8	6	57	41	14	27	82	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am currently eating one of your  free from  chocolate dessert yogurts  which are very nice by the way  and I ve noticed that the pot is made of ridged plastic. Why on earth would you make a yogurt pot from ridged plastic? How am I meant to get the last little bits out with a teaspoon? Now this isn t a complaint at all  I enjoyed it  just food for thought maybe. Perhaps you could put it forward to Mr Tesco.  Thanks   Amy					2016-06-19T19:39:45+0000	1466365185	2016-06-19 21:39:45	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly my 89 year old grandma was told an hour before her weekly delivery that it was not coming and she has to re order. She panicked being nearly blind and very old. Eventually customer services sent out some essentials and sent her a partial refund after discussions. Then today the van arrived without my groceries on it! 6.45pm on a Sunday! I have a five month old child who needs formula. Apparently it is coming on another delivery on a time I have not wanted because you messed up! Absolutely terrible customer service.

I did my shopping and paid then got stopped when I got to the door by the security guard!!...  My manager wants to see you ...were his words I was quite shocked and couldn t believe it when he marched me and my daughter through the store with the embarrasment of everyone looking. We were taken to one of the rooms at the back of the store and when I asked what they are accusing us off  the reply was .. we haven t accused you. Well why the hell were we marched through the store like we were. They said they wanted to check my shopping and did I have a receipt....well who wouldnt have a receipt for for the shopping they have paid for. I told them I wanted them to check all my shopping so I gave them the receipt and put all the shopping on the table as apparently they are not allowed to touch the shopping in the trolley. I asked them to check everything and asked what I was supposed to have done. Apparently the receipts of the reduced items are being changed. So I asked them to check it all. The only thing that was incorrect was the reduced price Jacket poatoes which were not supposed to be reduced as they are still in date  21 jun and today was the 19th  but this was picked out by the cashier when I was paying for the items. To be honest I did not even look at the date. Saw they were reduced on the shelf and picked them up and put them in my trolley. When the cashier picked this up  she called the supervisor who took it away  then brought it back and he told the cashier I could have them. I told the secuirty guard this and he was asking why I was angry...well who wouldnt be if they were treated like that.  On top of all that  my daughter is epileptic and cannot deal with things like this. It plays on her mind and guess what...as soon as we got home she has had a tonic clonic seizure. So I am annoyed and angry!! When I told them she suffers from epilepsy the guard just said sorry he didnt know and I should have told him then he would have left her by the door...who with I wonder??  The security guard did not even had the decency to apologise  instead got annoyed at me for being angry. He said someone was changing the stickers...maybe they should check the staff who put the receipts on because I have taken a photos (It does not allow me to attach all of them here) of the reduced ticket and the orginal bar code.  So Tesco....who has made a mistake here!! Check and train your staff properly before you accuse your customers. You have caused my daughter to have a seizure that could have been avoided.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13501769_10209468780893967_2265683477247348909_n.jpg?oh=21879af22432ef1751af8cace2c6c9ef&oe=58E521BB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13501769_10209468780893967_2265683477247348909_n.jpg?oh=ea0ffde82ff2b254007a23716fa16757&oe=591A715D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209468780893967&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-19T17:22:59+0000	1466356979	2016-06-19 19:22:59	3	16	7	1	24	15	9	6	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	4	0

It s usually good practice to acknowledge a customer who smiles at you and asks how your day is going. Aside from telling me the price of my items  no eye contact and no acknowledgment of conversation  I hope that you have had a good Sunday and that your shift went quickly. We all have bad days however the lack of interest in the customer was pretty worrying. I wish you and your colleagues all the best however as some constructive criticism  maybe smile or talk to the people who penultimatly help keep you in employment?

Just how long does it take for a complaint to be investigated?  Initially submitted on 20 February  promised a reply within 14 working days.  10 March  no contact received  promised a reply within next couple of days.  24 March  no contact  promised reply  as soon as possible .  27 March  promised a reply when  colleague is back in office  from annual leave (they had ample time to reply before their annual leave!)  9 April  receive a response that is completely unsatisfactory and generic.  10 April  will respond  as soon as we can .  3 May  advised my responses of 9 and 10 April not sent on  will be  treated as urgent .  6 May  email received with so many inaccuracies  reply sent from me.  27 May  I request an update.  31 May  still no reply  promised a resolution in  up to 14 days .  4 June  they request a meeting - I had already specified written contact only so refused and advised I will escalate if not resolved soon  promised contact  within 14 days . STILL NOTHING OVER 14 DAYS LATER! So it s nearly 4 months now and nothing received.					2016-06-19T13:32:15+0000	1466343135	2016-06-19 15:32:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was thrilled when the range was extended to toffee ice cream cones  chocolate covered ice cream lollies   Solero  style lollies  and dough balls to name a few. For a while the range even extended across two freezer sections! Recently  however  when I ve gone into store the range is back at bare minimum in only one freezer section. This is extremely disappointing as I m sure you can appreciate finding allergen free food is difficult  and having them to find they are no longer available makes the situation worse.					2016-06-18T21:42:59+0000	1466286179	2016-06-18 23:42:59	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One member of staff each time on that area and customer services.  Tonight I got so fed up I asked to see the manager. Took 20 minutes for one to finally appear  Sami  was given the usual excuses  lack of staff and people on breaks. No real apology or an offer to speak to a senior manager. Never even listened to my complaint  just repeated the same thing time and time again.   I felt really sorry for the lady on the lottery counter. Having to deal with phone calls  customers irate with waiting on both tills. She was nearly in tears.  Please get more staff  and please get managers who can apologise to customers properly and can provide staffing so customers don t get irate  doesn t look good for your customers seeing low paid staff stressed and struggling.					2016-06-18T19:17:15+0000	1466277435	2016-06-18 21:17:15	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They only had 215 euros left so that s what we took. We got to Spain and one of the 50 euro notes was a fake. ...how embarrassing... phoned the store and was told to take note in. Did so and it was changed into pounds.....BUT at the selling rate not what we got it for...so not only did we lose the difference...we also had the embarrassment of a fake note plus getting more money out of a wall in spain at a further cost..plus my time and petrol to have to go and get it changed back.  This shouldn t happen at such a well known store.  Fuming. Will be speaking to trading standards as the notes obviously aren t checked or someone is adding them in.					2016-06-18T19:15:11+0000	1466277311	2016-06-18 21:15:11	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We contacted the shop but was told that it hadn t been handed in as yet. As we were desperate to locate this cherished rabbit  I popped back into the store in the evening & spoke to very understanding lady at customer services who took my name & number & said she d have a look around the store for me. Later that evening I received a message to say that he d been found safe & well!!  My daughter & I went into the store this morning to collect him. We were handed a box with a note attached  saying that rabbit had been looked after over night & has been having a lovely time with his new friends. Inside the box was Jessica s very special rabbit with 3 plastic ducks inside!!  This thoughtful act has proved that a big organisation can still offer a personal touch! Our heart felt thanks to Debbie (wines & spirits dept) and the lovely lady at customer services. Thank you New Milton Tesco ‚ù§Ô∏è					2016-06-18T18:30:11+0000	1466274611	2016-06-18 20:30:11	323	11	346	23	380	11	10	1	8	0	322	22	1	0	0	0	0

A few years ago I spoke to a store manager about it who assured me he would educate his staff to put the labels over the original barcode to stop this happening. This was last week... Reduced sticker IS over original barcode but still I got charged full price. Twitter people agreed to refund me by money card. This was Featherstall Rd  Oldham store. So today I went to Failsworth store  bought 2 reduced sandwiches  decided to check my receipt while still in store instead of when I got home... sure enough got charged full price for one of them. Customer service desk was busy  lady had called repeatedly for a manager. The duty manager was standing in plain view  seemingly doing nothing. The other angry customer asked if we d been overcharged too! The managers never come. Eventually the other customer made him listen to his complaint. The customer service lady refunded me. This is a very regular occurrence & a common complaint amongst people I talk to. You must be making a small fortune from all the customers & the amount of times you overcharge people. It s simply not good enough! You need to train your staff to look for a reduced sticker & then make sure the item scans at the correct price. Other supermarkets manage it! You also need to make sure your shelf prices match those on the till as mostly they don t! I am totally sick of being ripped off every single time I enter one of your stores. I used to just ignore it  but it happens so often  I ve decided I m not going to put up with it any more. So unless you get your act together you may be hearing from me regularly!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13442366_10209795539033554_2988327689145424761_n.jpg?oh=fc8a2cf4f25a6713083651202416b03e&oe=58EC04EA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13442366_10209795539033554_2988327689145424761_n.jpg?oh=008bff6c181037519906ca1dace9c2c2&oe=591A91E7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209795539033554&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-18T17:30:02+0000	1466271002	2016-06-18 19:30:02	2	7	2	0	9	6	2	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Its not just one product. Ok the girls at the checkout will come over with a load of pre printed barcodes that do work and scan it through  so its not the end of the world. I just wondered if you ever considered getting barcode printing machines that print barcodes that scan? Its wearing thin having to ask for a colleague to scan everytime i go in  as its been going on for at least half a year. I also feel for your staff that have increased workload due to poor equipment.					2016-06-18T15:11:03+0000	1466262663	2016-06-18 17:11:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just interested to understand why you charge ¬£1.43 for a 4 pack of pack up size rice pudding but at most other shops they are only a pound and in one leading pound shop you can get two for ¬£1 and have good dates on  I understand you need to maintain profit margins on items but the product is a lot more in your stores.					2016-06-18T14:23:44+0000	1466259824	2016-06-18 16:23:44	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However. You seem to have changed the style. The tabs are longer and more elastic. Which sounds great. But..... They now stretch and completely lose the shape! The padding in the nappy seems to be smaller meaning it now no longer fits my little ones bottom without completely shifting to one side.  The nappy sounds plastic and rustles. When the nappy gets wet it s staying on the surface wet and crystals come out. And she s got the most awful nappy rash. She can only wear them for 2 hours max before I have to change them. Meaning nighttime are a Nono.  A disappointed Tesco nappy lover :( worst thing is I ve opened all my bags for storage and I m stuck with them. :(	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13434714_10157163367840637_788818109097615258_n.jpg?oh=21e8ce98deb9b8cccb94c32bf8abd2aa&oe=58F02E0D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/13443124_10157163367840637_788818109097615258_o.jpg?oh=714fdcd5e1831d15ebc7d65913ba5e7f&oe=58ED9DEF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157163367840637&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-18T13:51:39+0000	1466257899	2016-06-18 15:51:39	0	15	0	0	15	15	7	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And the whole place was up and running almost instantly once we were back inside. Very impressed.					2016-06-18T12:36:48+0000	1466253408	2016-06-18 14:36:48	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The latest was Tesco s chicken in mushroom sauce with rice  which I had for a speedy lunch.  There may be an issue with too much salt in things  but enough salt to bring out the flavour would be good.  What s the point of producing dishes that don t taste right?  The good thing is that the salt pot is to hand to bring the taste up to edible.  It s ok for people whose palate is tuned to bland and tasteless food  sometimes for health reasons  and I suppose that it is better to leave it out for those people.  Then the rest of us who like tasty food can add salt.  A most notable exception is Quorn vegetarian cottage pie which Tesco also sell  and this has more body and taste than meaty ones.  Currently on offer until the 21st at ¬£5 for three  if you fancy trying it.					2016-06-18T12:06:57+0000	1466251617	2016-06-18 14:06:57	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

It wouldn t scan at the checkout  so the lady told me to take it to customer services. So I did that  she gave me my clubcard back and I went home. It wasn t until later that night  that my husband realised with great sadness  that the lady hadn t actually given me back my cream üòÇ He was most upset  and I just wondered if it was too late to do anything about it. It was a genuine error on behalf of the lady at customer services  and at the end of a long shop  I just was not paying enough attention. I got my points for my cream  just no actual cream üòÇ  I cannot find my receipt  but it should be traceable with my clubcard  as the points went on. I have sent the number to you in a private message.  Thank you    Nikki and Kevin (a very distressed cream-less husband)					2016-06-18T12:04:27+0000	1466251467	2016-06-18 14:04:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter opened her birthday gift of a new bike only to find it has two broken parts. I have pictures bit cant post them here. As this now put together  it does not fit in my car to take it to my local store. I do not want to return it but need one for my daughter that is not broken. What are my options please. How quickly can this be sorted out as my daughter is very upset. üòû					2016-06-18T07:36:34+0000	1466235394	2016-06-18 09:36:34	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I mean that your colleague was trying to guide maybe about 25 shallow trolleys into a trolley bay! I waited patiently to cross to my car and the colleague turned and said  oh you want to cross?   I have all these trolleys to move   My point I am trying to raise that is this in your car park/trolley retrieval training to push that many trolleys in your car park safely?? How can one person control all of those once momentum took hold?? I felt very uneasy about it and it s been on my mind since it happened.					2016-06-18T06:37:30+0000	1466231850	2016-06-18 08:37:30	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I picked up a bottle of vodka which is a few nights drinks so don t judge please and took to the checkout. It scanned at ¬£19 and I explained that due to another store beginning with  M  had the same bottle for ¬£15  they should price match. I was informed no but would check with supervisor. The supervisor then informed me that this isn t accountable when buying things under offer. So I agreed to get rid of my beloved Ben and Jerrys in respect for the saving. This was all processed and due to a very long queue forming I decided to pay and go to save any more upset or irate customers. On paying I seen ¬£5 on the screen  so assumed this was my savings but upon checking receipt at home  I still have paid ¬£19 for the vodka and not ¬£15 price match. Also I had to leave Mr Ben and Mr Jerry at home. üò≠üò≠please help!

The first time I ever bought anything from any Tesco  was an online shop the other day. The delivery driver was really nice  and explained what the different colour bags was  substitutes etc seeing as It was my 1st delivery from you. Im surprised at the quality of the meat  as it was your own make  and some from the farm thingy :) My sons going on about the your cheap beans as if theyre heaven. I even got a call from the tesco that delivered asking if everything was ok. All in all  quite a good experience  and will be ordering again from you.

I was told that [quote] :  It s not my job . When I called the manager on the first occasion a week ago I was told that he would be  spoken to . Tonight  the same thing happened. I was told to take my bottle of alcohol to the customer services and again told by the security guard that  it was not his job and I could complain if I wanted to . Point1 : I had paid for my purchase so why should I have leave the self service till and take the bottle to be untagged at customer services myself? Previously  before this security guard was employed  all staff took the tagged bottle to customer services to be untagged then returned to the customer at the self-service till. Point 2 : I suspect the problem is that this security guard may be of the stricter islamic faith who strictly observes islamic teaching regarding alcohol. This is fine and I respect his point of view as we live in a free country where everyone is entitled to their political  religious and sexual freedoms. However : There are obviously two sides to this freedom. A customer is also free  in the UK  to buy alcohol. If a member of Tesco s staff feels that touching a bottle of alcohol is against his religion then I woud urge Tesco to redeploy this man in a position where he will not be at risk of contravening his beliefs  to which he is entitled. But I am also entitled  as a paying cutomer  not to be obliged to go out of my way to accommodate religious and cultural beliefs which are alien to me and to which I have a perfect right not to subscribe. In other words  I too have rights. Point 3 : This security guard  when I complained  told me that I could have gone to a manned till or to customer services with my purcheases. My reply : I am paying for my purchases and I will decide where to pay for my goods  not you. Point 4 : I urge Tesco management at Levenshulme to do two things : (1) Not to employ security guards at self-service tills  [especially as this is NOT their designated r√¥le]  but to instead employ members of staff trained to deal with customers. (2) Not to use staff with religious objections to handling alcohol in positions where they may be exposed to this. This letter of complaint is primarily addresed to Tesco Levenshulme management and I will await their feedback before I send this to Tesco CEO  Dave Lewis and before I publicise this matter further with Tesco Head Office. I think 4 days is sufficicent for a considered reply. Finally  I reiterate that I respect others beliefs but will not accept having to go out of my way to conform to religious sensitivities of those whose beliefs I do not share and are not part of the culture I was brought up in.

Firstly I ve noticed a huge sign above your Halal meat counter there proudly proclaiming that none of the animals have been stunned which is in poor taste. Those people purchasing meat from this counter will inevitably know this and the rest of us don t need our nose rubbed in it!  Secondly all they have for fathers day is one gondola end which is pretty much just stocked with bottles of booze (I think all but one shelf)! So I m assuming you guys think Dad s sit around getting drunk! Mind you choosing a Ramadan gift for my neighbours was pretty simple as there is half an aisle dedicated to that!!

Asda do 20 cans of carlsberg for ¬£10  I was charged ¬£39 for 3 cases of 20 cans  asda would have charged me ¬£30. Your price promise is not clear for in store customers  after speaking to a helpful customer services assistant I was told I had to buy over 3 branded items. Considering we bought 60 cans carlsberg  1 case cider  60 cans of coke zero  I think that counts for more than 10 branded products. If u see this please share with others  because its a very misleading ad campaign.

Despite living in Stevenage where there are two Tesco Extras we regularly drive up to Baldock to do our weekly shop for one reason - there is a basket of fruit for children to help themselves to when they are shopping. As a mum of two young children (a 2 year old and a 12 week old baby) the weekly food shop is not always an enjoyable experience. However when we go to Tesco Baldock my toddler is always excited to pick a piece of fruit and happily tucks in whilst I do the shopping. Such a simple idea but you have no idea how much it can help and avoids so many dramas because she gets bored! Thank you so much Tesco Baldock!! It s a shame more shops do not put in this much effort - shame on them!					2016-06-17T20:48:32+0000	1466196512	2016-06-17 22:48:32	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was quite nervous as I m not a makeup person normally  a bit of eye shadow and mascara is as far as I have gone  maybe lip gloss. I m converted by Nicola s great  lesson and finished look she did for me. She was patient  listened and talked me through all I needed to know  advising me on which products she thought would be best for me. The result was natural and fresh faced and made me feel lovely. Thank you Nicola. Shame the wedding is not in town I would be in for another session otherwise.					2016-06-17T20:37:26+0000	1466195846	2016-06-17 22:37:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had a delivery last night and after a hard session for my other half at the gym he decided to treat himself and have pizza. Luckily I had ordered two Tesco frozen pizza one chicken and bacon and one spicey meat feast. I put the chicken one on the tray and it smells and looks lovely and I m really looking forward to eating it for the first time once cooked. However. . . . . my poor other halfs pizza is not so good looking. This is no reflection on my fiance but his pizza has two sides. One is a meat feast upon meat feast and the other is a weeny tomato sauce scrapped base. They both arrived on the Tesco lorry in the same basket in the same bag so I can only assume this devastation took place before the nice delivery driver man got his hands on them. Well I hope my man can rearrange his meaty bits before eating them or half the pizza will be a rather big disappointment	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13418801_10153489859476021_6698261344600603201_n.jpg?oh=d8cc93317dbbebbfe55010b1a6be4148&oe=58E6DE1A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13418801_10153489859476021_6698261344600603201_n.jpg?oh=043b0f3ef0efe429d7ce96304cedc6a3&oe=58EEBB17	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153489859476021&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-17T18:56:36+0000	1466189796	2016-06-17 20:56:36	8	3	10	0	13	0	0	0	0	0	8	0	1	1	0	0	0

Whilst walking her past the shop this evening  I was told that I should have  a proper dog at the end of the lead .  Why this person felt compelled to act in this manner is beyond me.

While going around the store one member of staff tutted at her and rolled her eyes because she couldn t not get around the scooter. I also notice that one of the Internet shoppers was on their phone while working. At the check out the member of staff did not give a friendly welcome nor give eye contact throughout the transaction  the only time the member of staff did talk was to tell us the total  when it came to pay my nan wanted to pay by card instead of helping by passing the card reader down to my nan she just sat there and waited to the point I had to squeeze through and pass it to my nan. When the transaction ended there was no friendly goodbye or a receipt pass to her. When it came to my transaction I has the same lack of response as well. I would love to give you a name of the member of staff but they was not wearing a name badge but these are the numbers at the bottom of the receipt 029 1022 1708 one should be the till number and one should be the operator number hopefully you can track the staff member down.

We were looking for some chocolate at your branch at bukit tinggi  Klang yesterday. While my colleague wanted to buy this chocolate  I noticed that the expiry date is on 30th June 2016. It is another 2 weeks to go. Luckily we do checked the expiry date. What if some consumers just take and pay? You should check your goods from time to time and withdraw goods are short shelf life s from the display. #tescomalaysia	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13417521_10153734025621818_1782239780187061884_n.jpg?oh=96bcea9ee6f345407c157c7a391d000c&oe=591D1814	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13417521_10153734025621818_1782239780187061884_n.jpg?oh=53260c5facb50f0d9d9beb895e053ecf&oe=591FFE19	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153734025621818&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-17T15:17:10+0000	1466176630	2016-06-17 17:17:10	5	11	5	0	16	11	7	4	17	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

This was a fathers day gift and I figured I d ordered in plenty of time. As of 14/6 the item is logged as dispatched on the tracker but hasn t changed location. My post has been today and no item delivered with it. Really disappointed that yet again Tesco Direct has literally failed to deliver! Please can someone confirm if this item has actually been dispatched or maybe arrange for me to collect from a local store (Basildon  Essex). Order number in comments.

The new one was ok but the battery was never fantastic. Over the months  it took longer to charge and when in use the battery went very quickly and then it wouldnt charge at all. I exchanged the charger and it worked for a while and then had the same issue as above and then resulting in it taking literally days to charge and when in use goes within 30 mins. I went to my local Tesco which is Oxford Retail Park today to get a full refund as it was purchased within a year and I have the receipt. At the customer services desk  they were happy to give me a refund  but the ref. no. on the receipt was not recignised on the system and she said she needed a no. to provide a redund. I telephoned customer services from instore and explained the issue  they said i had option to repair. I want a refund. Correct me if im wrong but an option is a choice  i want refund not repair as like i said i have reciept and was purchased within a year. Im disgusted that i was not given a refund  the item is faulty and I should be given one. The staff at the customer services desk and the manager in store was happy to do refund so want to know why one wasnt given. My daughter is really upset about it.					2016-06-17T11:40:45+0000	1466163645	2016-06-17 13:40:45	0	12	0	0	12	12	8	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just had to squeeze my 3 month old daughter out of the car in her car seat without trying to scratch the car next to me and then clip her on the buggy with cars going past.  So many times I have seen people get into their car in a parent/child space after being in the store with NO child in tow! Also I have seen people park in these spaces then walk off to the high street! Can there be better monitoring of these spaces!! Also can it be made more obvious these spaces are for parents with children under 5 years old!! Don t get me started on the number of times I ve seen teenagers pile out of 4x4 s in the parent/child spaces.					2016-06-17T11:18:11+0000	1466162291	2016-06-17 13:18:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My wife informed me that the music playing was 50 cent and to listen closely as the song that was playing (very loudly I might add) was in fact the uncensored version with several mentions of the F word (I m sure you know which one I mean and it s not flump) and also many mentions of a word beginning with N and rhymes with bigger...... I just don t think it s good enough!!					2016-06-16T21:23:49+0000	1466112229	2016-06-16 23:23:49	6	8	6	0	14	8	5	3	4	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m still waiting on my order (ref 419400924) that was meant to be delivered today 19:00-20:00. I have called your Custer Service team who have told me they are trying to contact the driver but I ve heard nothing more. I m starting to get the feeling I may not get my shopping  and this is less than helpful considering I have children I need to provide food for in the morning. Can you advise any further please?					2016-06-16T20:56:32+0000	1466110592	2016-06-16 22:56:32	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was advised to visit my local store - 15 miles away. Why would I do that if I don t know for a fact that I can get it? What year are you trading in? 1916???					2016-06-16T20:40:45+0000	1466109645	2016-06-16 22:40:45	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought hamburgers which were TWO WEEKS passed their sell by date  only to be told that I could  pick another pack of burgers up for free (not great customer service  especially as there was no apology). I have settled after dinner and have now started eating  hazelnut and Belgian chocolate  cookies  only to find that they are sultana cookies. All this from one experience in Tesco. Definitely not a happy customer.					2016-06-16T20:13:35+0000	1466108015	2016-06-16 22:13:35	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was offered an exchange but unfortunately the magazine was out of stock. When the woman who was serving me went off to sort out a refund  my mum (who was waiting for me further down the store) overheard the woman talking to another Tesco worker about me returning the magazine and shaking her head and showing her the packaging  gesturing as if I was not telling the truth and had stolen the free gift! I wouldn t expect this from one of your workers  not at all happy :/					2016-06-16T19:58:34+0000	1466107114	2016-06-16 21:58:34	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The small pile is the edible! 4! So a pack that cost me ¬£2  gave me 4 raspberries. 50p each  value for money?! I think not. It s not worth the cost of the petrol for me to drive back and get my money back but I needed to let you know I m incredibly unhappy  not that I expect it makes any difference to you whatsoever but at least others might get a heads up and think twice before trusting your employees to keep on top of the mouldy fruit and veg! They were soft  furry and definitely not  fresh  as they claim to be. After buying 2 watermelons yesterday that were mushy in the middle and pears last week that once out of the bag I realised were brown and mushy  I think it s safe to say your quality control team are failing miserably!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13393981_10153792923537903_366351835873079040_n.jpg?oh=0f91f9dc86621fe90e8e8dbd470ee991&oe=5921CE14	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13393981_10153792923537903_366351835873079040_n.jpg?oh=61e47d6d3a8f3ebf64c9863b0225ff28&oe=58DD1E01	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153792923537903&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-16T19:20:34+0000	1466104834	2016-06-16 21:20:34	11	4	12	0	16	4	4	0	2	0	11	1	0	0	0	0	0

I have just spent unnecessary time queuing at your petrol station to find your sign saying  all grades here  to be incorrect. I queued for a few minutes and then drove to next space  to find a sign over the handle saying diesel was unavailable. I could not reverse out as it would have been dangerous  so I had to go all the way round and queue again. I don t know what has made me more angry  the delay resulting in me being late to pick up my son or the fact your polite member of staff informed me lots of people complain about the sign  but management can t do anything about it as the signs are fixed. This shows it is not helpful to customers and causes frustration - please find a fix! They are metal signs  so surely a magnetic sticker to go over the top when out of a grade or something similar!

After a delayed flight of 2 hrs  we arrived home at 7.30 pm.   Plenty of time for our 8-9 delivery.  My son in law had been there since 6.30 painting  and was there to see us home.    Absolutely starving. We waited and waited.   I finally rang customer service and was told the driver was stuck in traffic.   Considering we had no problem getting from the airport  the time of night and the area we live  I thought this was ludicrous.     We waited another 20 minutes and rang again.    This time to be told by someone else that the driver tried to deliver early and phoned. Absolutely not.   We had no calls . He also said the driver couldn t find us.   We live on the main road!!   I obviously went nuts as that s two different stories and no shopping.   I was told they would rede liver at 11am next day.  I said as we had two disabled people that lived with us and what was u supposed to feed them with after such a long day until then .    I said if they could deliver between 8 and 9 I would accept the delivery but I wanted all the deli products to be re picked as they had been on the van all day.   I was told as they were bar coded that was impossible ! I told him not to bother I would get the shopping myself first thing which I did before 9 this morning.      Imagine our surprise when after 12 along comes the Tesco van with my order.   I chatted with the young man about what had happened and that he would have to take it away as I had all ready got what I needed.   He was rather embarrassed and produced a bunch of flowers which he had been told to give me by his manager.    A nice gesture But does not alter the fact  I had been let down.

Delivery never showed up  no call  no message  nothing. Once I called  I was told the driver had returned to the depot for unknown reasons. I had to cancel the order  then re-order for the next day (Saturday morning  brilliant - NOT). For some reason they had to cancel my payment for the first order  then take another for the second  but it took 5 days for the money from the first order to be credited back to me. I was told I d get a call and an explanation as to what happened and why the delivery wasn t made. Guess what - never got a call. No call  no explanation  no apology for the inconvenience caused.  Send a message to the  contact us  page for customer service - silence. No answer. Lovely way to treat customers - needless to say I ve started check other supermarkets and will be moving somewhere else for my purchases in future.					2016-06-16T18:27:48+0000	1466101668	2016-06-16 20:27:48	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Normally it goes without a tantrum or tears. She helps me with my shopping and looks after the food. The staff normally look at her and smile and all is generally a glorious experience.  Today  however  was completely different. Sophia was walking with me as per normal.  Going towards the last aisle that we needed (bin bags!) Sophia doing her usual 3 year old act slow walking with the occasional spin  ended up falling into one of the end shelving displays. Not just a small bump I must add  a large crash as some of the display fell  followed by a scream and lots of loud sobs.   An elderly lady heard and came to my rescue of trying to help Sophia with her tears while I tried in vein to see what damage she caused to herself as well as picking up her apple and the loo roll that had gone over the floor.  Not one member of staff helped  but walked past. Even when completely flustered at the checkout  after telling the assistant what had happened  no one came to see if she was okay. No staff helped at all.   Now  my daughter is left with a nasty bruise and scratches from the shelving and I m left disheartened as no one helped.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13419142_1219297324770550_2128367629662071102_n.jpg?oh=6269f2d3ae26621a3da53bcd901d8100&oe=58EBF49A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13419142_1219297324770550_2128367629662071102_n.jpg?oh=fdcd613ab8e576de13ddf923d0d11061&oe=58D7B88F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1219297324770550&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-16T18:25:00+0000	1466101500	2016-06-16 20:25:00	0	10	0	0	10	10	4	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m feeling sad because in Tesco North Finchley London today I spotted John West tuna products. I have been led to believe you no longer stock this brand as they have been proven to use fishing methods that are not friendly to the environment? I hope you can help.

Arrangements were made with the store for a manager to visit me this afternoon and to discuss how this could have been handled better.  Unfortunately I am still waiting and it s 19.10.  Think I will definitely be using an alternative supermarket in the future.					2016-06-16T18:11:00+0000	1466100660	2016-06-16 20:11:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

T  he seam had let go of the bag  the member of staff then proceeded with ungloved hands to pick up the frozen food put it all back in the bag and putting back in the freezer and walked away  I stood at the freezer for over 10 minutes and had to tell a customer not to take that bag coz it had been all over the floor    I then wentblooking for the member of staff and on approaching her asked to speak to someone in management to inform them of what I had seen ie her dropping the food on the floor then picking it up and putting it back in the bag  the response was I am management and she walked off and totally ignored me.  So if Tesco management have no idea of health and hygiene or food handling protocol theres not much hope for the staff  so long story short keep your groceries Tesco I will never use your store again  I thought I would draw this to your attention to give you an opportunity to respond before voicing my concerns on all forums					2016-06-16T17:01:39+0000	1466096499	2016-06-16 19:01:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was informed it was in stock and to expect delivery on Saturday 11th June. I waited in all day  no delivery  no contact  nothing. I had also arranged for our kitchen to be completed on Monday to incorporate the wine chiller. I called Tesco who told me that they couldn t contact the delivery company and that they would email them and contact me. I received no contact. I had to contact Tesco AGAIN  who tried contacting the delivery company. I then had to call the delivery company  G2S  myself to arrange delivery and who advised me that Tesco did not provided complete contact details. They advised they now couldn t deliver until the following monday  20th June but they could ask one of their partner companies  Arrow XL  to deliver on Friday 17th June. Arrow XL have just called me to advise that they are unable to deliver the item on Friday because they haven t received the stock from the supplier. I called Tesco to cancel the order and they REFUSED to refund me! I spent ¬£269.00 on this wine cooler which I have not received and Tesco will not refund me. ABSOLUTE DISGRACE.					2016-06-16T16:00:24+0000	1466092824	2016-06-16 18:00:24	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wasn t expecting the best performance  just a basic water spurt and some small bubbles. I put in batteries and loaded it with water and bubble mix. What we got was most pathetic water spurt I ve ever seen from a pistol and absolutely no bubbles. The little fan goes round but generates zero bubbles. It s very inexpensive so I don t expect much but it should work.  Please don t tell me to take it back  it s hot and I m busy.  Don t just tell me you are  sorry.  I d  like to see somebody from your buying dept get one from stock and show us all a video of it actually working. Because I believe you re selling a product that simply is not fit for sale. Given its for lips all children  that s just mean  not to mention against the law.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13413046_10154246531482288_1048909886823858930_n.jpg?oh=781a46621950fcbcfa1c814a422de389&oe=591FD9B3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13413046_10154246531482288_1048909886823858930_n.jpg?oh=b2a1f260bf06c91b20c5fdb9f490d424&oe=591BB4BE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154246531482288&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-16T14:40:26+0000	1466088026	2016-06-16 16:40:26	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am losing confidence in Tesco as this is happening more often. I have delivery saver and have used it for 3 years  but will have to reconsider.  Incidentally...the item was skewers. There are 2 alternatives. No skewers in barbecue season? I now have to take a journey into town and back to buy said skewers.

They are very useful if they used right  but some people park there that shouldn t!! I mentioned this to one women who had just parked there because it was raining. Came back and she left my car with a key Mark!! However I really want to bring to your attention the lack of baby trolleys! Every Time I have gone to your store there never is any available!! The visit before last night  my partner went to  go look around the car park  however on my own I can not do this  especially in the rain! Now I could ask at the customer service desk however with a new born baby visits to the shops have to be quick and convenient.  Might have to start going to morrisons!! Which is very disappointing because I use your delivery service twice a week and shop regularly in your store.					2016-06-16T13:07:19+0000	1466082439	2016-06-16 15:07:19	4	28	4	0	32	28	8	20	30	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately  Tesco doesn t sell enough of the sorts of thing I buy - you ve asked me for a list before but nobody took any action on it. This time I found a very useful product for when I doin t have time to make my own from scratch - the packets of flatbread. 1 piece is 100 calories (nearly 50 calories less than a piece of pitta)  so fine to have with soup when weight watching. Returned this week to get another packet to find that you ve discontinued it - bit of a short run. Apparently quite a few other people have been prowling the aisles looking for ithe flatbread this week and also left disappointed. You mysteriously withdrew that excellent Sri Lankan soup a while ago.					2016-06-16T12:09:45+0000	1466078985	2016-06-16 14:09:45	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have always left very good feedback regard the customer service i have received from your company on many occasions. However  on this occasion its not such good news.  I have been messed about  passed from pillar to post  spoken down to & literally lied to by representatives from Tesco for the past 3 weeks.  I have been trying to exchange my clubcard vouchers in my local store for nigh on 3 weeks now...... The machines are constantly out of order or require attention. Coincidently  this always seems to be the case around clubcard boost time...?!  hmm..... Customer services  for the most part  at my local store (Dudley) are no help whatsoever one member of staff is particularly rude and unhelpful & im hoping this will be dealt with in a separate complain direct to store.  I was referred to the telephone number specifically for clubcard on Monday (13/06/16) due to the fact the machines would for some unknown reason only print half of my entitlement...... this happened to a friend of mine too.... we were there over an hour trying to resolve the issue and after various attempts to get the machines up and running i was advised to accept the 50% vouchers and call regarding the rest. Upon calling clubcard  I spoke with a gentleman who  for all intents a purposes seemed to know what he was doing..... he dealt with my issue  said he d found the cause  apologised and promise to send out an email with my ¬£50.00 remaining monies owed in the form of a gift card with ¬£5.00 added for my troubles. This email  he said  would be valid for a year from the date of call.... He told me it could take upto 24 hours to receive. I waited........ I waited some more...... I called back ... i was told to give another 24 hours...... I did. Nothing. I called clubcard back on 15/06/16 and spoke with another gentleman who said first gentleman had done nothing..! Zilch!!... Not even any notes on the account  so i had to explain myself all over again....... 2nd gentleman then promised to emulate 1st gentleman s offer.... ok i said  benefit of the doubt i thought..... however  then the guy preceeded to inform me that it wouldnt be valid for 12m after all and would only be until the end of the boost promotion. So   26.06.16. Another 2 days (on top of the 2 weeks trying to print on the broken machines in store....) lost whereby i could have been shopping for goods.  As a result i asked to speak with management . A fella called Jason then came on the line  no surname as usual but a ref of: KI43 given. Again i had to repeat myself and state i wasnt happy with their offer as i felt i was losing out. Everyone else has been able to shop at their leisure  mine would be last minute panic buys at this rate.......  He told me that he would match the offer of ¬£55.00 but it would still have to be used by 26.06.16 so in compensation for the misinformation given  i was offered a further ¬£20.00 added to my clubcard account for future usage. He told me that the card would come  through the post  next day delivery with a receipt date promised for today 16/06/16. To stay home as it required a signature. Fine. after 45 mins on the telephone i obviously had things to do so i accepted and I seemed to be getting nowhere fast anyhow. Today  i waited..... waited... waited...... Post came. No card. Asked postman. No card. I rang clubcard again. i explained predicament again. Have now been informed that next day delivery means 2 days..?!?!?? As day 1 it only gets sent to the postroom and they have to be told exactly what next day delivery is..?!?!  hmm......? So  im then given the track & trace number to check royal mail myself... as if ive not got enough to do already..... I did. They arnt even in receipt of any such parcel/letter....!!!   I now have to take yet another day out of my schedule to wait in tomorrow  in the vain hope it may just arrive  like it was meant to arrive today.....??   As you can no doubt appreciate  im sceptical to say the least..!  I have lost valuble time in which to use these vouchers. MY entitlement as a very loyal customer. Nothing more  nothing less...... nothing for my troubles...... nothing for my time on the telephone........ which incidently amounts to almost 2 hours now..!!!! nothing for the constant brainumbingly repeating myself over and over... nothing for the incompetancy & training issues of your staff...?!!   Nothing for the lies of fella number 1 on Monday.......Futhermore  i have been informed by 2 different members of staff at clubcard that they could have done all this IN STORE a week ago........ but clearly they couldnt be bothered... & im not surprised in all honesty with the lady they have working on that department...!!   Tesco  i am appalled  disgusted and most of all disappointed in you........ but as i have already been told over and over and over again.......  theres nothing we can do.....    Well  im sorry i believe there is & i would very much like an apology  an explaination & some form of compensation.......  Ill await contact from yourselves in regards to this matter. Thank you.					2016-06-16T11:40:03+0000	1466077203	2016-06-16 13:40:03	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

None of them have opened at all and lots of the heads have dropped off. These were a present and I know the person who spent their money on them would be very upset to know this had happened. I put them out ready to take back to tescos but then my friend said it would be worth trying on here.

How about meal boxes like the burger boxes you get off burger vans? So someone has two or three different items they can go in the same box if they wish instead of two or three separate bags all sweating. A small mod to the table machine to list and sum up entire contents of box to one barcode for at the till (even sauce tubs). You d be able to do offers easier if you wanted to also.

Usually the staff are friendly in our local tesco. Today one of your colleagues was adjusting shelves in the baking aisle  blocking half of it. I politely asked her if I could pick up a vanilla extract which was above her (didn t want to lean over her incase it dropped). She shot up and looked at me like I d spat in her face and huffed at me. She looked at me with such disgust. Maybe a lesson in manners is in order or if she dislikes dealing with the general public maybe a career in retail isn t for her.					2016-06-16T09:14:48+0000	1466068488	2016-06-16 11:14:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a trampoline that was missing some parts and was trying to put it up ready for my sons birthday today  I called customer services and they sorted out the missing parts for me. By the time i got to the shop the parts were waiting along with a couple of water guns for my son and a very large bar of chocolate for me. The ladies help made this stressful situation so much easier and I am beyond grateful. My son loves his trampoline and was out at 6am testing it out. Thanks again Becca					2016-06-16T08:31:07+0000	1466065867	2016-06-16 10:31:07	3	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	3	1	0	0	0	0	0

I asked her how much cash back I could have and she replied none as the previous customer had cash back! There was no offer of an alternative forthcoming basically she didn t care!

I asked your staff what their policy was regarding dogs left in hot cars and was told if the window was open  even by half an inch  this was ok. Other people complained and were told the owners were in the cafe and wouldnt be long. Sorry Tesco  but this is unacceptable  dogs die in hot cars.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13434848_10153819884792746_3252351725368106471_n.jpg?oh=6e5e5748bd3a11a16208b894e8181d9f&oe=58E555D7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/q81/s720x720/13403351_10153819884792746_3252351725368106471_o.jpg?oh=ca4e71010588b5dc490f6ed28d099c40&oe=592245C6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153819884792746&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-15T21:07:39+0000	1466024859	2016-06-15 23:07:39	3	4	5	0	9	4	3	1	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	2	0

First of all  I m fine - or I will be soon. I had nasty accident but I m ok.  I went horse riding and let s just say it didn t end up quite as planned. I got on the horse ok and started out slowly but he started to speed up and we were going faster than I was comfortable with until we were going as fast as the horse could go!  Have to admit I was terrified!! Then the worst thing ever happened - I fell off and caught my foot in the stirrup and the horse was dragging me around in a circle. It wouldn t stop  it just kept going around and around. Thank God the store manager at Tesco s came out and unplugged the carousel.					2016-06-15T20:50:01+0000	1466023801	2016-06-15 22:50:01	1	0	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	2	0	0	0

I am disabled and use a mobility scooter and shopping is stressful enough without this kind of attitude.  He could hardly greet me did not offer any assistance and although he could see I was struggling to pack my shopping just keep shoving my items of shopping through.  It was irked when he en had to wait for me to find my club card and then even more when I had to ask him to pass me the machine.  Totally rude and unacceptable  but even more so because of my disability. I went to the customer services and asked to speak to checkout manager who was duly sent for. Just before she arrived someone was stopped on their way out and was then manhandled by approximately 6 store staff and security. When the checkout manager arrived she felt she was surely needed to assist this troublesome customer.  Quite what she was going to achieve I have no idea.  I was spoken to by a supervisor who duly apologised and said staff member would be spoken too.  However  I would say that because of the other commotion I felt my concerns were not quite so important!!!! I am not asking for any preferential treatment because of my disability but just common courtesy would have been good to see by all members of staff!!!!!					2016-06-15T19:58:29+0000	1466020709	2016-06-15 21:58:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Took them back to the shop (Port Glasgow Store) and was given a  sorry about that  and the 60p back that I paid for them  so they think that if you are mischarged it deserves compensation but finding a huge layer of mold on food that is meant to be in date deserves nothing? What a disgrace!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13423720_1745176762424712_7339326706120902875_n.jpg?oh=73c6b58c735999be4ca00feb88cce260&oe=58E9B916	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13423720_1745176762424712_7339326706120902875_n.jpg?oh=72e82707fac45f333787ef1bad561e21&oe=59246603	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1745176762424712&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-15T18:50:48+0000	1466016648	2016-06-15 20:50:48	1	6	1	1	8	6	3	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ran over to her and she spat out half the mouthful onto her table I heard something hit the table and I thought it was a tooth. No it was stone. I am disgusted that a stone could be inside a factory preparing food let alone being in one of the actuals rolls. I have to now monitor my child for 48 hours for any changes to her health incase she has swallowed more.

They are supporting our school and our pupil premium cohort of students. They have helped us raise money to fund a summer school (after funding was scrapped by the government)  and today have offered to provide the food for free for the students and staff on each of the days of our summer school.  They are also prepared to help with other events and provisions within our school. Their generosity is amazing and we as a school are so grateful for the support they are showing us. Their community spirit is brilliant and they are making a real difference to our students.

Those and the ginger nuts were the only  easily available  biscuits my son could eat. I didn t worry and assumed there was going to be a packaging change. How wrong was I. I noticed they were back on the shelves today and so checked the packaging. They now contain soya flour which means my son can no longer eat them.  I know a lot of families who recommended  and relied  on these biscuits being available and who now can t have them. There is no indication that these are a new recipe so unless you check every time someone could be made seriously ill.  Why change what isn t broken?!  It takes so long to find any decent  affordable and tasty food items when you re dealing with multiple allergies. The last thing we need is recipes changing and those simple items being taken away.  I usually commend tesco on their brilliant free from range but this has really annoyed and upset me.					2016-06-15T17:09:48+0000	1466010588	2016-06-15 19:09:48	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can definitely say it will b the last! Goods that I received required to be assembled so could not possibly know the drawers were misaligned until finishing the sideboard. Your returns policy has made it so difficult that I have decided to keep the shoddy goods you have sold me totally against my wishes and your goodwill gesture is ¬£16. No tesco every little does not help in anyway whatsoever.					2016-06-15T15:47:20+0000	1466005640	2016-06-15 17:47:20	2	1	2	2	5	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is sadly negated by the fact that it is currently sitting inside of the same display dome as other gluten containing products with no wrapping. I love that you are trying to help people like me but cross contamination is just as bad as adding it into the product. Please could you retrain your staff  they are so polite and helpful and I m sure that it is just a lack of knowledge.					2016-06-15T15:27:21+0000	1466004441	2016-06-15 17:27:21	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I told him that s not the right price as I ve been buying these for weeks at 75p to which he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Bloody day light robbery and ignorance if you ask me.

I would hate to think how long that dirty hair has been stewing in the pasta but it is far from acceptable and ruined my lunch!

Despite one rubber leg missing from one  I was initially impressed. Heating water and cooking took a lot less time compared to  traditional  methods. Unfortunately  half way through cooking a meal  one of them decided to pack in. Turning the hob off and waiting a while (in case it was overheating) made no difference. I returned the item to Tesco where I received a refund (eventually - after several attempts to contact the supplier failed) and went straight in to the next door LIDL where I bought a Silvercrest induction hob for ¬£7 less. I have to say  for whatever reason  the Silvercrest is by far more superior to the VonShef one(s). Would I recommend this particular VonShef hob - no. Save your money and buy a Silvercrest induction hob from LIDL instead.  I gave the product 2 stars.  Today I received this from Tesco: Our staff has read your review and values your contribution even though it did not meet all our website guidelines. Thanks for sharing  and we hope to publish next time!   What you mean is.... you don`t value honesty and only want the best reviews  even for an inferior product.  It doesn`t work that way.	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAVNn3S_-t0wRCY&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdirect.tescoassets.com%2Fdirectuiassets%2FMerchandising%2FNonSeasonal%2Fen_GB%2Fbanners%2Fresponsive%2Fevents2016%2FFatherxs_Day_2016_PDP_FeatureSpace.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQADpluwojU34IIB	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQArEXrH55Ol3Mbm&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdirect.tescoassets.com%2Fdirectuiassets%2FMerchandising%2FNonSeasonal%2Fen_GB%2Fbanners%2Fresponsive%2Fevents2016%2FFatherxs_Day_2016_PDP_FeatureSpace.jpg&_nc_hash=AQB_wvV1AfwRn2Is	http://www.tesco.com/direct/vonshef-digital-electric-induction-hob-2000w-in-black/720-9780.prd#QbZulwVgxT77xd5D.99	tesco.com	2016-06-15T03:58:30+0000	1465963110	2016-06-15 05:58:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your new (terrible - sorry  Ruth and that bloke have got to go) advert about taking back food you don t want anymore is worrying. Am I right in thinking that the bunch of bananas I pick up could have been sitting on the side of someone s manky kitchen covered in cat wee before I take them home? I noticed that  perishable foods must be returned before use by date  - but does this mean that a perishable food (meat  dairy  etc.) could have been taken home by someone  left on the side out of a fridge and then brought back for me to buy and then get ill from? If people can t commit to a bloody melon then maybe they need  assistance  with their shopping. Until you can confirm what happens to the returned food/just stop allowing perishable foods to be returned then I m off to trusty sainsbury s! ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø					2016-06-14T22:36:36+0000	1465943796	2016-06-15 00:36:36	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She absolutely LOVED it! You really made her day! Siobhan was very lovely  showed great customer service and is a credit to your company and store! She definitely deserves some recognition and perhaps a little treat for going above and beyond today.

Doesn t make sense to me why you would keep a deal for the smaller jars and not the bigger jars but even more so the desserts for 7mth+ but not the main meals!!!  How is that promoting healthy eating???!!! Surely the deal needs to be across the board or not at all. Asda for example do 12 for ¬£6 but for convenience being closer to home I still come to Tesco. If the deal no longer valid I will have no choice but to shop elsewhere! Extremely disappointed by this decision! üòï					2016-06-14T21:04:02+0000	1465938242	2016-06-14 23:04:02	0	9	0	0	9	9	4	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This seems excessive.  No normal Pg Tips. Just a tiny box of the extra strong pg tips. Nor Yorkshire Tea. None at all. Actually not many teas except as seen. It s not like theres no room for a bit of variety.... Maybe make one facing less of 15 facings of identical teas!? Looks more like an advert for punjana and nambarrie than a bay in a supermarket in the tea aisle. A choice is good. In a supermarket especially.  This is like what you could expect to find in a dodgy corner shop  except on a larger scale. Emergency tea bags to make do until you get to Tesco to restock the teabags.  Except this IS Tesco.   You used to stock Pg tips and Yorkshire tea..  Tea is very important!! And these brands are just nasty.   Please bring back Pg tips :(	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13419194_998044310316949_7600250589397478705_n.jpg?oh=1f9e321bd9fe0f5e2e1f8de5f7234b0d&oe=59248DD9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13419194_998044310316949_7600250589397478705_n.jpg?oh=ea0d5dfe0cb58ced4da4052e9d5d11ce&oe=58E94D18	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=998044310316949&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-14T20:41:02+0000	1465936862	2016-06-14 22:41:02	3	8	4	0	12	8	4	4	3	0	3	0	1	0	0	0	0

I spoke again with Louise the FFP Manageress . She says a certain number of Tesco stores are taking part in the Food Bank donations . The ones who are are applying the 70% as opposed to the 90% reduction off end of date fruit and veg and then donating what doesn t sell to Food Banks .  My point remains the same . If Tescos want to be seen to  donate to the food banks then they should do so in some other way which does not involve penalising the poor customers who shop in store . Expecting poor people to pay increased reduction price   say eg 54p for two partially rotten advocates is not good . It shouldnt have cost ¬£1.80 for them in the 1st place . Louise and I both commented on how since the 20% increase in reduction price - the end of date FF produce is not selling and the poor customers have taken their minuscule  business to other stores which do the 90% reduction . I ve been told  that Food Banks are not allowed to distribute out of date foods ? As far as the the price war the poor are up against goes     I notice small tub of Lurpack margarine is ¬£3.25 - or two for ¬£4 . Really these prices are ridiculouse . We exist in a world where it has become acceptable and expected for supermarket prices to keep rising .  Whilst all supermarkets can donate to food banks is semi rotten fruit and veg that their poorest customers can no longer afford to buy because they have raised the final reduction price by 20% . Anyone who doesn t appreciate what poverty means please don t comment on this post ...					2016-06-14T20:24:41+0000	1465935881	2016-06-14 22:24:41	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well not quite true after the driver had gone we found wet bags not on the outside but inside drenched..

We ve had this lawn mower only since the end of last summer and after just a couple of uses this year this happens after we finish the latest job. Luckily my partner went outside to put everything away our children had been playing with and found it alight next to the house  thankfully before the house was affected and the children were inside. This is obviously dangerous  have I missed a recall?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13434891_10153768872798412_6243140304300154696_n.jpg?oh=10a16bea34bcd9432335d652c4910e56&oe=58E4DC0C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13434891_10153768872798412_6243140304300154696_n.jpg?oh=b2c923fcbb2219c0c418f869c90a4145&oe=58D5D601	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153768872798412&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-14T18:59:46+0000	1465930786	2016-06-14 20:59:46	0	16	6	0	22	16	7	9	11	0	0	0	4	0	0	2	0

Even though the best before date is 15/06 the baby corn was brown and looked like something had been chewing on it. None of it was useable. Very poor quality control.

I visited Tesco Bursledon yesterday with a friend and my infant. As I was strapping my baby in the car  I saw a single male member of staff (wearing a green Tesco shirt and badge) pull in to the Parent and Child bay  get out and walk towards the store. So I say   Excuse me  you seem to have left your baby in the car!  To which he replied   Sorry what?  I said   Well you must have left your child in the car as you don t seem to have one with you.    He then proceeded to laugh at me and walked off so I followed him in and pointed him out to security. The very helpful lady on the customer service desk said she recognised him and would speak to his manager.   On numerous occasions I have witnessed single male and female customers pull up in their sports cars ecg  leaving me to walk across the massive carpark with a small baby and bags in the rain to find a trolly. Each time I have reported this to security and nothing is ever done about it. I would expect security to ask that they move to a regular parking bay but they don t; one time I was even instructed to take pictures and report it myself. This is unacceptable.  Not enough is being done to ensure these spaces are available for people who really need them. This also goes for disabled parking spaces  which I have also witnessed being misused. Tesco has failed me and countless other parents in allowing selfish  entitled people to do as they please. Would that member of staff have parked in a disabled bay to save himself a few extra steps?					2016-06-14T17:59:24+0000	1465927164	2016-06-14 19:59:24	0	13	0	0	13	13	7	6	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She could see I was really struggling with my tantruming  tired 2 year old and offered to let her scan the shopping I was buying. However  said two year old kicked off as soon as she was sat behind the check out and wanted to watch instead. so she asked if my other daughter who was helping me with her sister would like to have a go. She loved it! Didn t stop giggling all the way through it. Unfortunately this lady didn t have a badge on for me to get her name but she was a god send keeping both kids entertained so I could finish my shopping without struggling. It s a daily battle in the supermarket for us parents with kids who just don t want to be there or insist on dragging everything off the shelves. Every store needs a lady like this.

Twice now I have bought them and both lots have started to rot after only 4 days despite being taken out of the plastic bag they were sold in and put in a paper bag as soon as I got home. These were then stored in a cool dark place. This never happened with previous carrots. The carrots also appear softer  almost waterier. I m also disappointed that you  or my local branch at least  have ceased to stock the Greenvale brand of potatoes. Ive been buying them for several years and found them to be a great all round potato.					2016-06-14T14:43:53+0000	1465915433	2016-06-14 16:43:53	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is most definitely the egg as the chicken failed to turn up at all.   Upon opening my usually delicious pasta  I found with distain  that the chicken must have had a previous appointment  as there wasn t any there!   Maybe he was visiting relatives in Kiev or Kentucky  or even Henley on Thames but he definitely wasn t where he should have been  in my pasta. At least I could rely on good old dependable egg to hold the fort until the chicken decided to put in an appearance.   But this seemed a rather poultry substitute by comparison.   I have eaten my pasta  meatless  so I don t need a replacement. This also won t stop me seeking the elusive chicken in my next pasta but could you just inform him when he eventually turns up  that he needs to be a bit more reliable as he is killing the myth that he actually came first.					2016-06-14T13:11:48+0000	1465909908	2016-06-14 15:11:48	1	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

I order my groceries online each week with Tesco as well as use Tesco Direct. Never had a problem with them until now. I ordered my daughter a school uniform skirt online with Tesco and apparently they still have my old address on my account and delivered it to the wrong one.  Even though my groceries and whatever I ordered from Tesco direct come to my current address. I received an email (reply to my inquiry)  stating that I m not getting my order because I didn t check the address when I placed the order. Yes I should have checked but I didn t because I stupidly assumed since you had my correct address for my weekly orders that there wouldn t be an issue. Since I don t have a car and can t get to the old house I m basically out of an order.					2016-06-14T13:06:54+0000	1465909614	2016-06-14 15:06:54	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had only just set off when a 50L pot of green paint fell over and spilled all over the boot of my boyfriend s dad s car. Thankfully as it was quiet  Goran from your team was straight onto it  and three hours later - after twelve rolls of kitchen towel and a pack of baby wipes - we are almost there. We couldn t have done it without Goran s unflappable help and advice. Thanks to you and to him so much for his help.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13445348_789037438326_4059702976422595841_n.jpg?oh=1dd2e39ffaf60412b1afa01bc31ff7e7&oe=58E8BD5D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13445348_789037438326_4059702976422595841_n.jpg?oh=11e2af7ef1c61ff118d7bcc0bfb4e271&oe=58E8A91B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=789037438326&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-14T13:06:10+0000	1465909570	2016-06-14 15:06:10	3	2	5	0	7	2	2	0	2	0	3	0	2	0	0	0	0

Whilst on my tea break with my mate Derek Jamieson  we were carefully perusing the meal deals and various snacks on offer  when we were shocked to notice that amoungst 32.5g bags of walkers crisps  Tesco had snuck in a box full of  (part if a multipack-not to be sold seperatly) 25g bags of crisps.  Now i am all for maximising your profits  but a massive supermarket chain like this ripping off the working man for prawn cocktail Potato chips was too far...   We felt the need to bring this to your immediate attention.  Many thanks . Jamie and Del. üëçüèª					2016-06-14T10:56:37+0000	1465901797	2016-06-14 12:56:37	27	17	32	1	50	17	9	8	21	0	26	0	0	4	0	1	0

Having watched your most recent advert where a melon is returned  can you please tell me what happens to food items returned as part of your no questions asked returns policy. Do all food items go automatically go to animal feed / waste or do certain items go back on the shelves? Thank you.					2016-06-14T08:59:46+0000	1465894786	2016-06-14 10:59:46	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a click to collect item as a birthday gift for my 7 year old  and was told on the website that it would be available for collection today.  However  today the store website is saying that it is shut today (general listing)  open today (click to collect section of opening hours for store) and when I called Tesco Direct customer service they have told me it looks like the store is shut and there is nothing they can do.  Going to be a great start to a special day tomorrow when I have to tell my wee boy we haven t got him a gift yet‚Ä¶ It is ridiculously unhelpful to state that an item will be available for collection when the store is shut so there can be no delivery OR collection of that item on that day.					2016-06-14T08:27:27+0000	1465892847	2016-06-14 10:27:27	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Roads are for car tyres  pavements are for pedestrians. There was such a small gap between the front of this van and the railings where the building work is taking place that my daughter and I could barely get through. This was in Newport Road in Aldershot on the evening of Friday 10th June. I told your driver how he ought to stop and he did say  sorry  but he had such a big smile that it proved he wasn t bothered if I had been pushing a pram and had to take my life in my hands and go into the roadway to pass someone who is too lazy to walk. Lack of consideration should be taught to your staff as well as how to park vehicles in accordance with the rules of the road.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13450316_10210191733373945_7640128663395690818_n.jpg?oh=c4b3103e08032ccf61ef73fde621d991&oe=58D75E0F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13450316_10210191733373945_7640128663395690818_n.jpg?oh=bb63bbb9727dea534afe7588b6da6c48&oe=58E3F202	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210191733373945&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-13T21:24:48+0000	1465853088	2016-06-13 23:24:48	2	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I write because I have lost all faith in your Tesco Direct service  and I am appalled that you seem happy to take my hard-earned money without actually delivering any goods  and in fact  without ever actually notifying me that said goods would not be turning up.  When our old dishwasher decided to bite the dust several weeks ago  we searched around for a replacement. Thinking we had found a good deal  we placed an order on Tesco Direct. Our money was taken and we received an email confirming our order  and advising that we would soon be able to confirm a delivery slot online. All fine so far. However with less than a week remaining until the date our email confirmed the dishwasher would be delivered by  we became concerned that we still could not specify a delivery date or time.  I duly called the number to enquire why this was  only to be told that the dishwasher we have ordered - and paid for in full - was STILL out of stock. Given that we had never once been informed that the product was out of stock  never mind this still being the case  it begs the question - how long are you planning to hang on to our money with no intention of fulfilling our order?  I look forward to your response.					2016-06-13T21:24:44+0000	1465853084	2016-06-13 23:24:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was a right pain to them this evening and they were great.  Firstly I filled up my car using the pay at pump system  but me being the idiot I am  took the nossle out of my car a bit to quickly  resulting in me spilling a small amount down the side of my car  and consequently  onto the tarmac. I cleaned up my car  and went into the building to inform one of your colleagues of the situtation. She had spotted my mishap and was already on her way out to put sand on the spilt petrol.  I then proceed to leave to petrol station  not realising I had left my purse ON THE ROOF OF MY CAR!! Oops. I didn t realise Until I had driven about half a mile and needed to use it. I immediently backtraced my route back to the station to see if anyone had handed in my purse. Unfortunately not  but kindly your colleagues assisted me to see if it had fallen off within the forecourt  -alas it had not. Your staff then proceed to check the CCTV to see if it was on my car when I had left the station. When they noticed it was  two of them assisted me up the road towards windhover roundabout  on foot  to try and look for it with me.   It was never found  but your staff did a fantastic job trying to help me find it. They definately went the extra mile today. I can remember their names unfortunately (maybe Lynn and Anne??) But they were super  and what made it even better is that  even though I had done two rather careless things  they didn t make me feel bad about it. They just kind reassured me that it happens more often than you would expect.  So yes  SUPER customer service this evening. Thank you.  PS if anyone finds a cream purse with cats on it  thats mine thanks  I don t want to pay for a new drivers  license!					2016-06-13T20:35:04+0000	1465850104	2016-06-13 22:35:04	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

They have been friendly  helpful professionals that have gone over and above the requirements of delivering groceries.  Today I had the benefit of two people deliver together at a time right after school just as I was dealing with children squabbling and trying to serve up cooked dinner while trying to control 2 dogs barking like crazy at the intrusion. My initial thought was  oh great timing. When in fact it was the best timing ever  one of the drivers loaded the truck while the other stated I cans see you have your hands full let me unpack the boxes onto your worktop while you dish up and sort out the kids! By the time I had finished sorting the squabble  the tea and the dogs she had it all unloaded!  So big thank you to them for the great service  and if there is anyway you can identify the last 3 weeks delivery drivers to pass on my feedback please do üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª					2016-06-13T20:30:19+0000	1465849819	2016-06-13 22:30:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Found the only pair in her size and proceeded to the self service tills.  The wellies wouldn t scan and the lady on these tills spoke over her headset to tell someone  she was then asked how much as she said to the person on the other end ¬£14.  She then turned to me and said should couldn t sell them if they don t scan! I asked for the manager and she also told me they couldn t sell them if they don t scan so I left without them and my other shopping.  If it was as simple as if things don t scan you can t sell them why was the First Lady asked  how much they were ? I have since traveled another 12 miles to Sainsburys and purchased different wellies from them					2016-06-13T20:26:27+0000	1465849587	2016-06-13 22:26:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited Hampton tescos tonight (Peterborough) and experienced the best customer service in a long time!  I had my little boy with me who at 20 months is into everything and doesn t ever want to stay with me. He tried a few times to run off. Janice who worked there  kindly guided him back to me while I was unpacking my stuff from the trolley. She then let my little boy sit on her lap while she scanned all my stuff. He was so happy and it was lovely of her to do this! I hope Janice sees this message and realises what a lovely and kind lady she is! She s a credit to your company!

NO! Not acceptable policy for foods - returned food won t be allowed back on sale as it may have been contaminated  therefore wasted - and cost passed on to customers. If you buy the wrong food or change your mind when you get home - TOUGH - your mistake  you bear the cost ........ or just use it. This REALLY puts me off Tesco more than they have already with prices.					2016-06-13T18:40:24+0000	1465843224	2016-06-13 20:40:24	5	15	5	0	20	15	6	9	4	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

One month ago my 5 year old daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumour  a grade one glioma of her brain stem. Tesco is one of my daughters favourite places. She loves getting the fruit and veg and using the scales. We quite often use the cafe for a snack after school or during our food shop.  The staff there know Freya well because she loves to chat to them. You don t find many people who take the time to speak to children and give them time to pay for their own shopping (sweets) like the staff do in Newton Aycliffe.  You can imagine their shock when Freya was diagnosed. They ve known her since she was a baby and have watched her grow. Freya goes to all their events and thoroughly enjoys them.  Especially a lady named Angela Walker- Freya absolutely adores her as she always has a hug and a moment for a quick chat.  Today she was invited in to receive a tablet and some crafts which I am sure had to be authorised from the higher personnel- so thank you to them too. They made a little girl very happy.  People are so quick to complain these days so I wanted to let you know of the wonderful work ALL the staff do at the aNewton Aycliffe branch.  Many thanks. Becky  Paul and most importantly Freya X Angela Walker	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13428655_10208214600497388_522142805386074812_n.jpg?oh=f998cdbfde4d263ec641538893a64969&oe=591E7D08	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13428655_10208214600497388_522142805386074812_n.jpg?oh=4db0a67efec135bed57ea80e35e856e3&oe=58ED5C1D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208214600497388&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-13T16:02:22+0000	1465833742	2016-06-13 18:02:22	995	63	1071	130	1264	60	40	20	163	0	986	76	0	0	0	0	0

Although in the photo it looks a tight squeeze but doable  trust me I tried it was not doable.   But having to lift my pushchair AND son into the road  on a bend  with no dropped kerbs  after a long day at work  in an area where cars frequently drive well over 40mph is not ideal. Not only is this hard work but it s extremely dangerous. As I say I struggled and took my chances on the road  but had this been a wheelchair user it would have been impossible.   Not acceptable.   I m not a complainer to be honest  this could well be my first ever whinge  but I feel having to compromise the safety of my son is kind of a big deal which can be easily solved by courteous parking.

Also have a very dissappointed 5 year old boy. I ordered a bed two weeks ago using some of my clubcard vouchers. Delivery was due tomorrow but just got a call saying bed out of stock and a refund had been processed. The bed is in stock to order online now!! Which is annoying. Is it in stock or not? Also I would have liked the option to just wait until it was in stock again rather than have my order cancelled and refund processed without asking me first. Now the refund has been done I can t have an alternative bed (for same price). Also why today (day before delivery) do we get told this? Not a week or two weeks ago? Do suppliers not know what stock they have in their warehouse?? (Not very useful for their insurers!) ! Expecting delivery today we have cleared out my sons room  totally redocarated it and bought other furniture which will work around the bed. We did all this at the weekend so knowing we were not going to receive the item sooner wpuld have been appreciated. We now have to re assemble my sons other bed from the garage where we had stored it just this morning. My son is also upset as he was very excited about the bed and the two weeks waiting for a 5 year old was bad enough  so get this news today is frustrating. Tesco have offered very little support in coming to a helpful solution. We have been told we will get the amount used in clubcard vouchers in a different card. That is fine but if I use them to order the bed again which is currently in stock online will I get the bed this time? The price of the bed has also gone up since I ordered it so now I will have to pay more for it too???  This is just ridiculous. Can someone tell me whether the bed exists or not and if I can order it?  I left a message on Facebook a few months absolutely praising the customer service I got in store and now I m kicking myself for it because today has been a huge dissappointed and a shambles!					2016-06-13T15:06:21+0000	1465830381	2016-06-13 17:06:21	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a mouthful and felt something sharp. It was a white pointy piece of plastic! It is not even the same plastic as the container it was in or the fork which concerns me! This may need to be checked. I always shop at that store and have not had any problems with anything until now  I am very disappointed but also relieved it was me and not a child!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13432169_10157026627860187_1553406218326741351_n.jpg?oh=e1fe36ca79f82ef9a35ec4c1beefa766&oe=58E076E2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13432169_10157026627860187_1553406218326741351_n.jpg?oh=058f3997a90e9afeb0672a3dbceea67f&oe=58E844EF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157026627860187&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-13T14:20:43+0000	1465827643	2016-06-13 16:20:43	0	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

While shopping with my son  15 months  a gentleman in produce  Andy or Alan  I can t quite remember  started chatting to me and my son. After telling the gentleman my son knows the store so well he will be working there soon  and him asking which bit is his favourite  the fruit section  he went completely out of his way to get my son a banana and made him an official produce tester! ‚ò∫ Which he was thrilled with as we had run out so he didn t have one with his breakfast this morning! He was a truly lovely man who I think deserves some sort of recognition for his pleasant attitude. As I walked off to carry on shopping I could hear him talking to other customers. All round a very nice shopping trip! My son got his bananas  and I got my treats too üòä Thankyou Andy or Alan in produce!					2016-06-13T13:32:04+0000	1465824724	2016-06-13 15:32:04	6	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a pair of trousers for my autistic grandchild. they tried them on and for the first time they did not fit. I buy this child tesco clothes because normally they ar perfect. anyway  the child has a condition called pica. They eat all sorts of inappropriate things. In this instance they chose to open the bag in the hall which had been packed to return to the store  and eat the label! cardboard  paper and foam rubber are their favourite things to eat. I took the trousers which had not been touched nor worn back to the store a couple of days later. Apparently they cannot be returned without the tag on  even though I had the receipt from a couple of days before. So how then does one return something that was say faulty  are we supposed to keep the tags on clothes that we wear? I was particularly annoyed as the way I was spoken to was not particularly nice  it was accusatory to say the least. So can someone explain the return anything policy to me please? thank you					2016-06-12T21:45:14+0000	1465767914	2016-06-12 23:45:14	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I usually use my fresh food very quickly but this week saved some for my Sunday roast today. The best by date was today so I didn t think there would be a problem however my broccoli was fluffy and the carrots had turned to mush when I went to open them. I ve also had similar problems with the cheap strawberries. I know they are the  cheap  brand but I d still expect to be able to eat them whilst they are in date. Please go back to your old supplier  I know a lot of people that are disappointed with your new range of  fresh  food.					2016-06-12T19:50:16+0000	1465761016	2016-06-12 21:50:16	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Foods that are returned for a swap are NOT returned to the shelves.  There is NO Tesco in Oak Street - therefore NO soldier as refused service.  Bananas with red issues have NOT been injected with tainted blood.  Pistachios often contain the larvae of an orange worm  not a maggot and unavoidable.

To do the weekly  fruit  shop for the preschool which I work at. While we was shopping   I said to my daughter   would you like a piece of fruit as tesco do  free  fruit for children   she said yes & we went over . My god .. I have never seen such a disgusting area in all my life   this may seem a bit strong to you   but I was truly disgusted by the display .  The fruit area was absolutely filthy   the bits of fruit in there were rotten   it had an awful smell .. It was truly shocking . And for which ever staff member that had just dumped a bag of grapes in there   should feel bad .. It would have taken less than 10 minutes to clean & freshen the area . I have attached a photo & then at least you can see where I m coming from. This fruit display would never encourage any child to eat fresh products .	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13450748_10208964560205319_8423066888695365175_n.jpg?oh=e9877b0df680d4722579e932b022252f&oe=58DD3E27	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13450748_10208964560205319_8423066888695365175_n.jpg?oh=30be54892b59a987152d239aabede32d&oe=58EF312A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208964560205319&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-12T17:54:45+0000	1465754085	2016-06-12 19:54:45	6	5	9	1	15	5	3	2	0	0	6	0	2	0	0	1	0

Or think it s clever to call insulting names. To a diabetic having sugar free foods and drinks can be dangerous to your blood sugars.   Again Tesco I ask you why you you only do a couple of diabetic products.    People with diabetes do not manage their condition by cutting  sugary  foods out of their diet. If you have  diabetes  you can eat sugar-containing foods as part of your overall meal plan  as long as you account for the carbohydrate and calories in the food as part of your overall meal plan. Similarly  if you eat lots of so-called  sugar-free  foods  they may have replaced sucrose (sugar) with sweet tasting substances like sorbitol  mannitol  xylitol  isomalt  and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates. These are all  sugar alcohols   which are technically not  sugar  but are high in carbohydrate. Others may be sweetened with fructose  polydextrose  and maltodextrin  which also contain calories and carbohydrate. These foods will affect your blood glucose just as a sugar-containing food would  in proportion to the grams of carbohydrate in each serving of the food. In addition  foods containing these sugar alcohols can cause stomach discomfort and diarrhea if eaten in large quantities.  Other foods may be sweetened with aspartame or other non-caloric sweeteners like saccharin  acesulfame potassium  or sucralose. These sweeteners contain no carbohydrate. But again  you need to check the food label to see how many grams of carbohydrate are in each serving  because  sugar-free  does not mean  carbohydrate-free.  Some of the foods sweetened with non-caloric sweeteners (like aspartame-sweetened sodas) may indeed have no carbohydrate  and will have no effect on your blood glucose. Others  like an aspartame-sweetened yogurt  still contain carbohydrate (from the fruit or milk products in the yogurt) which must be calculated in your meal plan. These foods contain caloric sweeteners in combination with non-caloric sweeteners.  Work with your dietitian and healthcare team to learn how much of different types of foods you can eat at each meal and snack. Very likely your healthcare team will offer you the opportunity to use carbohydrate counting as a way to use meal planning to manage your blood glucose. In carbohydrate counting  you learn how many grams of carbohydrate you should aim for at each meal and snack. Then you read food labels and use carbohydrate gram counting food lists to figure out how you can  spend  the grams of carbohydrate allocated for a particular meal. You devise your meals based on how many grams of carbohydrate you can eat and how many grams of carbohydrate are in the various foods that comprise a given meal.					2016-06-12T17:14:08+0000	1465751648	2016-06-12 19:14:08	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am hoping this is a so called sick joke by someone.					2016-06-12T16:40:43+0000	1465749643	2016-06-12 18:40:43	1	17	2	0	19	17	7	10	10	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

It smelled pretty rank but we thought since it hadn t properly expired we would try and marinate it in some barbecue sauce. After an hour of marinating  we took the chicken out of the fridge and the stench was so awful because the chicken had definitely gone off so we threw it away. I cannot return this chicken to the store because a. It has barbecue sauce on it and  b. Because I am too lazy but I thought I would let you know anyway.

I mean it may seem like common sense that one may be in there but I m not sure my gastros would think of a gastropod as gastronomy. In this day and age I think I m meant to take offence to it being there & go running to the papers to complain but instead I washed off the raspberries & ate them.

I purchased a jar for my son (10mths) and niece (1yr) to have for their dinner. I was really impressed with how lovely the sauce smelt  however I was left very disappointed with the product by the time the children finished. I used less than half the jar and was thinking about using the rest another day but this won t be happening. Everything the sauce came into contact with was stained orange  without being glib the children looked like ommpa lummpa s! My sister in law and I had to scrub the children to get the orange colour out from their faces  my son is very blonde and the sauce has dyed his eyebrows! Their clothes including bibs/apron were stained and they are currently in the wash a second time with loads of stain remover. The seat of my son s highchair and his walker are also stained orange  neither of these seats can go through the wash. Very disappointed a product designed for children can have such a result and will be thinking twice about trying anything else from the range.					2016-06-12T12:52:50+0000	1465735970	2016-06-12 14:52:50	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I could hear a cracking noise while I was stirring it and was very surprised to realise it was actually the jug cracking! Surely that is ridiculously dangerous? This product really should be recalled. No where on the sticker does it say you can t use it with hot water and on your tesco direct website it even says perfect for soups. I ve included a photo of the jug so you can see for yourself how badly it has cracked after one use.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13428552_870537439745019_4928790130269594377_n.jpg?oh=a8b0605e91f667480fac44d77a46282b&oe=58D98466	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13428552_870537439745019_4928790130269594377_n.jpg?oh=2ffaaaae1f60836ed915547d58db7901&oe=58E1FA99	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=870537439745019&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-12T11:44:10+0000	1465731850	2016-06-12 13:44:10	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been a tesco fan girl for many years now.  I ve always shopped at tesco but around beginning of 2013 I started shopping there on only there. I find the customer service is amazing. Any store I have gone into the workers there not only are always on point with their service but they know how to have a laugh and I ve had many funny times with them. I ve even joined tesco mobile about a month ago and I don t think I ll be going back. The service is amazing and I found the quality of tesco products to be impeccable  for example I changed from pampers nappies and wipes to tesco and same with many of their other products like toiletries  detergents ect.  Thank you to all the people who work with tesco for making it such an amazing and friendly environment for us.. ‚ô°					2016-06-12T01:23:55+0000	1465694635	2016-06-12 03:23:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On 9th June I purchased one of your  duo wraps  from my local Tesco  Grove Green Maidstone. I ate the first wrap fine  this was the duck wrap. I was still feeling hungry so I decided to tuck into the second wrap which was chicken teriyaki (my auto correct just tried to change this to chicken  terrible  which I think  in this case  is more fitting). The first bite was fine  the second bite I took however felt strange. This was certainly not chicken in my mouth! At first I thought perhaps it was just a bit of tough chicken  how wrong was I! I pulled out the foreign object to find that it was not chicken at all but a bit of paper. Slightly wet and partly chewed  I unraveled the  chicken paper  which reads the words  TIME  with black edging around the corner.  Now I don t know if you ve recently sacked a member of staff  who thought adding this new ingredient would be good revenge or if it was a simple mistake? To be honest I don t care  I do care however that this wrap was going to be shared with my three year old son. Who unlike me would probably have attempted to chew it and after failing would have a spat it out - embarrassing for me out in public with people who are less understanding to the acts of a pre-schooler. Or B: (which is even worse) after not successfully managing to chew it just swallowed it down and worst case scenario  choked! Now I m usually a laid back person and let these sorts of things go over my head but you caught me on a bad day. Please can you in future be more careful about additives  such as time sheets  as they are not particularly pleasant nor are they beneficial to my diet. Thank you.   Kind regards Miss Dann  I d just like to add I consider myself a very loyal customer but this has put me off.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13442398_10209763856756857_830156039042355284_n.jpg?oh=be628037397d630ef293e8014ffc6635&oe=59193A9D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13442398_10209763856756857_830156039042355284_n.jpg?oh=99625256e9299e3f1830dacef9788122&oe=58EC6688	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209763856756857&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-11T20:19:37+0000	1465676377	2016-06-11 22:19:37	0	9	0	1	10	9	3	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are sat at the dinner table celebrating mums birthday and bought your tesco party platter cupcakes. From the bordon branch. Hampshire. And horrifying found this blue chunk of plastic imbedded in the jam -sponge. We ve taken lots of pics and got the packaging back out the bin. Unfortunately customer services shut at 6pm. Would love your comments on this matter!

Lying staff... Toys that were placed in front of a ¬£3 sign came up priced as ¬£9 at the till. Sneaky tesco employee quickly added a red out of stock sign while I was at checkout and made out it was there before.. Just admit you are wrong rather than pretend I am blind and cannot see a massive red sign I had my contacts lenses in you know. Disappointed my 3 year old daughter and made me out to be a liar.

My husband & I ordered a single bed for our daughter on Tesco.com making the use not only of tesco s final clubcard boost promotion but also taking advantage of an additional ¬£20 off e voucher found online when purchasing the bed. After arranging our days off for the delivery of said bed  buying a mattress  duvet  pillows & bed sheets  our two year old was thoroughly excited about the prospect of receiving her  big girls bed . Much to our dismay  the day before the delivery  we received a phone call from Tesco stating that the bed was no longer in stock despite the fact that we had paid for it 10 days earlier & they had no idea when it would be back in stock. We were told we would receive a refund plus our doubled up vouchers back. 9 days on & after countless phone calls to customer care  we are still awaiting our refund as well as our doubled up vouchers never mind the ¬£20 e coupon we have missed out on too. Tesco have said they could only refund the vouchers back to spend online which we have declined as we have lost confidence in the online service having not received our goods. We were told we would receive a store voucher so we could make use of the boost before it ends  within 5 working days but yet again with no avail.  So as it stands  we have no vouchers  no ¬£20 e coupon  no refund & no bed! I would be grateful if we could be contacted to get this issue rectified as we go on holiday next week & will have completely missed out on the boost promotion.			http://tesco.com/	tesco.com	2016-06-11T18:14:11+0000	1465668851	2016-06-11 20:14:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apparently our Italian driving licence and our Italian ID were not enough as NOT Irish. Does it sound like a discrimination as our Italian ID has not the same value as an Irish one? We have been living and working in the country for 5 years now and it is the first time some like this happens. Is there any explanation? thanks for your feedback.

Wonder if you can do something about the customers parking in Parent & Child bays at the Didsbury Parrswood store who don t have a child in sight when they use them? It leaves no spaces for parents who need them and the store are uncooperative about this issue.					2016-06-11T15:31:44+0000	1465659104	2016-06-11 17:31:44	1	10	1	0	11	10	4	6	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Don t really know how to put this down  but while we was shopping my partner unexpectedly came on her heavy period not long after her miscarriage  she quickly acted and went to grab a packet of sanitary towels from the shelf and run down for the toilets  she politely asked at the  costumer service  desk if it s OK to pay for them after useing them because I was in the middle of the shop with the bank card and due to the distress of getting blood all over the place and the embarrassment coming out of this situation. The laidy at the costumer service desk said  that it is against our policies   my partner then burst craiyng and felt lost.  After she have found me in the store in tears in her eyes and paniking  I have run to the costumer service desk and first politely ask them why they didn t let her go to the toilet (especially when they are females them selfs) and got the same answare  at that point I have slightly lost my temper ( I like to publicly apologise for that  even after some yung boy wants to be security tald me that they just doing there job and that I have to leave the store and that I am not ever welcome back)  I have used my card to pay the  70p  for the sanitary towels and let my partner go to the toilet. The words of the yung boy that wants to be security but didn t had visibly shown his security badge asked me to leave the store and then followed me to the car park with words  that I can t ever come back to the store again .  I am pleased  to say that I will never go to that store again due to the disgusting way of being treated and especially haw my partner have been embarrassed in such a distressing situation.  Well done to your  70p  policies  I think next time if there is next time will be lot easier to just run to the toilet without asking  and most likely no body wuld of noticed.... ;)  politlinnes and humanity and common sense out of window.					2016-06-11T14:29:13+0000	1465655353	2016-06-11 16:29:13	2	7	4	0	11	7	4	3	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	2	0

I had a funny turn while getting a few bits and a manager come over to make sure I was ok and got me a bag of ice and cold cloth. I believe he s the fresh food manager (didn t get his name) then a lovely lady Robin (from the deli counter I think) came over and looked after me until I felt better. Please pass on my gratitude as these members of staff made it much easier to deal with. Thank you xxx					2016-06-11T12:43:16+0000	1465648996	2016-06-11 14:43:16	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Latest one is your so called Organic Garlic bulbs in a net of 3 bulbs  not only are they not grown organic  They are grown with nasty chemicals in China  which are a health threat. Also the label is designed to mislead us to think they are EU produce if you read it in a hurry. I have finished buying all my food from you now  because you Cannot be honest and this sugests that you treat us all as mere punters who do not know what proper food is.

So this returned food you accept back  does it get destroyed or does it get released back onto the shelves for general sale?  I would just express my concerns about reselling these products. For all you know the box of frozen fish I ve just bought could have been defrosted  opened  touched. For all you know the oranges I ve just bought could have been injected with something nasty or dipped in a chemical. For all you know the fresh chicken I have just bought was actually left out of refrigeration for 24 hours and in direct sunlight for 8 of those hours.   How do you know? And how are you going to rectify this when someone gets sick  someone s child gets sick  someone dies?   You might think I m being extreme so by all means try to explain to me the safety measures you have in place so this doesn t happen.   In the meantime I will not be shopping at Tesco like I have for the past 5 years and will encourage my friends and family to do the same!  Thank you for reading and I look forward to hearing your response!					2016-06-11T11:23:44+0000	1465644224	2016-06-11 13:23:44	1	6	1	0	7	6	5	1	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Then I get a phone call telling me there is an issue with payment!!! Only because you great spending conscious tesco peeps have yoinked a ¬£3 BASKET CHARGE THAT WILL BE REFUNDED BUT I AM NOT GETTING THE GOODS I PURCHASED. So I called there customer services depth who told me  there is nothing I can do and the money has not actually left your account it s a reserve it goes into  so I said if the money is still in my account it would have not declined my transaction!!  The money is still in your account  was the reply so asked for a manager and he tried to tell me the same thing. Meanwhile back at the bat cave I have no shopping he then went on to explain it says in the terms and conditions and that when shopping online it is only a guide price!!!

It s only been upon unpacking my shopping I ve discovered this. Have to say I m slightly disappointed that the picker has seen this and STILL put it in my shopping as they would have had to scan it. The lid has been retightened and there was no sauce in the bag so this clearly happened in store. Knowing this could potentially be given to kids too  falls below the basic standard I would expect from Tesco. The bit on the bottom of the jar is mouldy üò∑.

After a recent trip to your Tesco Express (Huddersfield Road)  my two friends and I are most disgruntled after purchasing what we thought was the bargain of the century. A reduced to clear bag of Corona Extra Beer for ¬£8gbp. After taking this broken bag of beer to the checkout  and paying ¬£8gbp for the beer  we noticed properly packaged 10 packs of Corona Beer for no more than ¬£8gbp. We were most confused.  After arriving home from walking up a hill  in the rain  with the broken bag of beer we were shocked and appalled to find only 8 bottles of Corona Extra Beer. Why? Why would Tesco mislead us in such a cruel way to make us believe we were having a bargain of 8 bottles of Corona for ¬£8gbp when 10 bottles of correctly packaged Corona beer were also ¬£8gbp. Please explain to us what about that beer was  reduced  to clear. The only thing clear to us is that you  Tesco  are trying to take us for fools.  Please find attached photographs of the  reduced  beer  in faulty packaging. We would like a full explanation and compensation in the form of ¬£8gbp. We await your response.   TL;DR - 8 bottles of beer in faulty packaging sold to us for ¬£8gbp when 10 bottles of same beer in perfect packaging is being sold for also ¬£8gbp.   PS. The bottles are sticky.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13432196_10208449245341307_5453035599813340026_n.jpg?oh=7a8ab69fbd2141dbe06cdf1bb14002bb&oe=58EBF5B9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13432196_10208449245341307_5453035599813340026_n.jpg?oh=79a0aa38552b448a88714c570ec7902d&oe=58D65BCD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208449245341307&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-10T21:15:42+0000	1465593342	2016-06-10 23:15:42	1	20	2	2	24	20	9	11	18	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Your store in Aylesbury is a joke. My recent trip has been a total pain. The scan and shop broke near the end of my shop this is the 3rd time this has happened to me. The frozen food I went to buy was out of date on the 23/5/2016!!!! All 20 odd packets. The trolley bays are so full you can only just get round them in the car park. Honestly I will be shopping else where. I may only spend around ¬£600 a month in store and on petrol but especially better than you provide!!					2016-06-10T18:57:24+0000	1465585044	2016-06-10 20:57:24	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can ensure you he alone earns more than your security officer a month with ease  without taking my income in to account  yet  although we have always used tesco to shop  never once given anyone a reason to consider us for thieves  without fail every time he follows us around your store  follows us out of the door  and watches us as we leave in our car.   He is a pest! It is the most uncomfortable experience imaginable and we are strongly considering shopping at Asda  aldi or lidl instead for our weekly requirements as we never have this issue in these stores.   I am deeply saddened that your security staff feel the need to follow someone based on their looks.

My question is what happens to the melon? If it s still in date does it go back on the shelf? I wouldn t like to think that my food could have been sat in someone s house (at best) then returned!!! If it s not sold how does that help reduce the already huge problem of food waste in this country? It s a small thing I know but I would like to know.					2016-06-10T17:35:22+0000	1465580122	2016-06-10 19:35:22	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After attempting to unscrew the lock but failing one member of staff kicked the door down to get to my daughter. They were amazing I can t thank them enough.

However what happened today was absolutely unforgivable . I went through to your self checkout  and scanned and bagged all my items. I started to pack the bags underneath my buggy as I have a bit of a walk home. I had about 5 bags with me. Obviously this set off the  item removed from bagging area  alert. So I waited for a colleague to come over. When she did she said she wanted to see all my bags. I asked why as the screen only states item removed from bagging area and I was finished with packing anyway. She then accused me of having an unexpected item in my bags. I pointed out that the screen clearly states item removed from bagging area. I also pointed out that the guy next to me had a prompt like that and she didn t treat him the way she s treating me and she also didn t go through all his bags. She refused to listen and still demanded that she go through all my bags. She calls a colleague over and I am standing there as her and another lady are going through all my bags and making sure every single item is scanned (Mind you I had 5 bags full of items) Everyone is staring at me. At this point I lose my patience and tell them I refuse to stand there while they  treat me like I m thief and said I wanted to leave all my groceries and just take my babies food. And tell them they can cancel everything else off.  I grab the bag full of my babies food and go to another self check out  to scan it in again. And they are still standing there going through all those bags to make sure I didn t actually steal anything. I ve gone through your self checkout atleast 4-5 times a week and every time I ever got an alert like that the person always came over punched in their code and let me continue what I was doing.   I went to your customer service desk and spoke with  the deputy manager and of course she sided with her. Was not even interested in my side of it. She said she would speak to the colleague and walked away  I asked how she planned to do that when she never even asked me who the colleague was.   The only thing I can think of to as why your colleague treated me the way she did is maybe  she thinks I look dodgy because I am heavily tattooed which is just stupidity on her part.  I know  that me no longer spending ¬£300-¬£400 a month in your store isn t exactly going to effect you financially  but there is no way I will ever step foot in your store again out of principle					2016-06-10T17:09:24+0000	1465578564	2016-06-10 19:09:24	1	10	1	0	11	10	7	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When entering your store we were greeted by a sweet looking old lady offering samples of British Butter. My sister is Muslim and as its Ramadan she can not eat anything until later. I respect that so don t eat in front of her when we are out together. When we politely declined the offer of said butter the return comment from the lady was  oh  you don t like British then ...!  Now both my sister and myself are born and breed in England so the only thing that would make us different to everyone else that declined the offer would be my sisters headscarf. After a moment of shock we asked her why we wouldn t like British but got no reply. I am a nurse and have a lot of respect for the older generation but this comment was totally unacceptable. I asked to speak to the manager and along came Simon. We repeated the situation and he was fully supportive of our shock. He dealt with the issue immediately and asked the lady to leave. My sister often receives comments like this being a convert but I have never witnessed any company jump to her defence is such a remarkable way. He is a credit to your company and felt you needed to be made away. We left the store feeling respected and welcome.  Thank you Simon					2016-06-10T16:43:54+0000	1465577034	2016-06-10 18:43:54	4	8	5	1	14	8	8	0	0	0	4	1	0	0	0	0	0

Cancelled order to be redelivered tomorrow to be told not only do I not get my groceries when I wanted them you charge me twice too.

I was almost driven of the road and the speeding drive went along the grass verge so fast I couldn t see him for dust.  He was lucky it was just a verge without a ditch.  Goodness knows the carnage that would have occurred had I not have been driving slowing and there wasn t a horse or child on the road instead.  The location was Lower Baybridge Lane in Hampshire at about 2:40 today.   I am very disappointed and very worried about what could have happened if this driver isn t advised on country lane driving  Kind regards   Emma					2016-06-10T14:23:39+0000	1465568619	2016-06-10 16:23:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I asked why she explained that it is the law if bags are not being used for fresh products such as meat veg etc.  When I said that Morrisons do not charge for their small plastic bags the cashier explained it is because yours have handles.  I bumped into one of you managers on the way out and asked why do you bags have handles when other supermarkets don t and they do not charge.  He said that the cashier was wrong and that Morrison s were breaking the law!!!! I have since checked on the governments website and yes indeed all bags with handles are chargeable so this means that your cashier was correct on NOT your manager (who I suggest needs to be updated on this law!!) I strongly object to paying 5p for a minuscule plastic bag meant for wrapping not for carrying  and maybe Tesco should do the same as other supermarkets and NOT have handles on their wrapping bags and if this is not possible a sign warning people that they will be charged might be appropriate.  I would also like to know who pays for the bags that people leave in the trolly in the carpark and the ones flying about!! Also this is the first time since the law was changed that I have been asked to pay for a wrapping bag!!!  By the way I refused to pay so the cashier then had to throw away the bag which was now contaminated.					2016-06-10T14:06:40+0000	1465567600	2016-06-10 16:06:40	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve never had a problem returning items before  until I went to return an item today at the customer service desk. I had forgotten to bring my Club card back in with me  & was told extremely rudely that I  didn t deserve  the points that couldn t be taken off. Never mind the times where I do my weekly shopping and forget my card so I don t get any points.. so I think the attitude I had for gaining an  undeserved  10 points was absolutely ridiculous. I have always shopped at Tesco and never had a problem until today. Absolutely disgusted.					2016-06-10T14:00:51+0000	1465567251	2016-06-10 16:00:51	0	1	0	1	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just been on the phone to Tescos club card helpline - the first person Steve  who I spoke to was rude  supercilious and obtuse in his behaviour towards me in my quest to find out the answer to something I knew I had done wrong with my club card vouchers. When I asked to speak to someone else as I told him I did not like his tone and rude responses to me he told me they were busy  I said I would hold  he laughed and said their business would take a while. I refused to give him my number and I therefore hung and rang back. I am very  very pleased to say that Ashleigh  the lady I ended up talking to was very helpful  she let me talk  explain my position and confusion. She then responded and explained what she could do. She also then kindly explained how I could boost on line  even giving me a number to call should I not be successful in my quest to buy my son s birthday present. Through Asleigh s help I was made aware of the amount of money I had in vouchers  how I could successfully boost today and I will soon be collecting my son s vouchers. Steve  you could learn a lot from Ashleigh!					2016-06-10T13:01:22+0000	1465563682	2016-06-10 15:01:22	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to appeal to you to reach out to two potential online customers who had an unfortunate experience with you. My parents are in their 80s  my mother has not been well and my father has been caring for her. Online shopping would be ideal for them. I am a regular Tesco s shopper so I persuaded them to try it. They made an order for food for a special family get together  including a leg of lamb. They were most upset when the lamb did not arrive. This lonely sprout  that was not ordered but arrived instead  was not going to go far between seven of us! I helped them make a complaint. Nothing was done and they gave up. My mother has now just come out of hospital. It would be really helpful if they could be persuaded to give online ordering another try. I think it would have been very reasonable to have expected you to have apologised and to have sent something to compensate for their disappointment. Older customers need to be valued  don t you think? Thanks for listening.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13418861_10154261976616528_4544970080887398800_n.jpg?oh=5ff757009a813875870f322e7a09a298&oe=58E17C60	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13418861_10154261976616528_4544970080887398800_n.jpg?oh=555bc85e81b82bacd93554a37bb117ec&oe=58E4D36D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154261976616528&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-10T11:30:52+0000	1465558252	2016-06-10 13:30:52	2	7	2	0	9	7	3	4	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

So is the chair faulty or not ? You seem unable to make your minds up about this ? How can people have faith in buying anything from you if you don t know if a product is safe or not ? Can you please supply me with details of the problem with these chairs? As a consumer I have a right to know what the issue is and why if the chairs are unsafe or unfit for purpose there hasn t been an official recall ?					2016-06-10T10:57:22+0000	1465556242	2016-06-10 12:57:22	1	9	1	0	10	8	8	0	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have loved this daddy/son time but am now writing to inform you we will not be returning after today. I understand that menus are updated and change however today I was informed that instead of the usual egg/beans/sausage that my son usually has you now have a minimum of 5 items on a child s breakfast and I would be charged for 5 even if I didn t want them! I m not sure what your aim is? Do you intend to make extra profit on my time with you by charging for items I don t want? Do you intend for me to take the items I pay for and not eat them contributing to the growing food shortage that our planet is facing and adding to food waste when my 2 year old cannot eat a massive meal  or is it simply that tesco are supporting childhood obesity?? I would be very curious to hear your views on this!   Very disappointed   Tim Morphew					2016-06-10T08:43:40+0000	1465548220	2016-06-10 10:43:40	4	4	4	0	8	4	3	1	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

We went to use the lift in the store and when I pressed the lift button the doors opening and a youngish man was inside. The lift was already on the ground floor so he had just been standing inside. He said   I wouldnt go in that after what its just done . I took it with a pinch of salt - he seemed a bit strange and thought maybe the lift had jolted when it had reached the floor as they often do.My son and i went into the lift expecting the man to exit which he appeared to be doing  but he came back into the lift with us. He then pressed all the buttons not just the next floor button and the lift started to go up. A few seconds later the lift became stuck. I felt quite worried as he was behaving oddly. He then kept pressing all the lift buttons and banging on them and trying to open the lift doors. He wasnt panicking. He said he wanted to be an otis lift engineer and he could re-boot the lift. He seemed to me to be either autistic or he had been smoking something he was decidedly odd and I felt very threatened. I pressed the lift alarm button expecting it to keep ringing until someone answered. It did make a loud noise but no one seemed to be answering. I tried to call the store on my mobile but there was no signal. I may sound trivial but I was becoming quite worried and did feel threatened.  I then tried 999 as it seemed the only option and told them I was stuck and also that i felt threatened -- bit awkward when the threat is stood right next to you.  They put me through to the fire brigade and i explained etc and they were going to attend then at that point someone spoke on the intercom and we said we were stuck and they just said they would sort it and disappeared. To me this just left me with no communication with anybody. The fire brigade said oh you will be sorted and went off the line. After what seemed an age but was probably ten minutes the lift slowly moved back down and the doors opened and we left the lift. The odd guy stayed in the lift. I thought maybe somebody would be outside the lift but there was no one there. My son and I went to the security at the front of the shop to explain and tell bout the guy still messing in the lift. Nobody seemed aware in the shop that we had been stuck but apparently the pharmacy guy had eventually heard the alarm and told the manager but we were out by then.  Apparently the alarm contacts head office who control the lifts and they eventually contact someone in the store.  I was quite distressed traumatised and upset by it all.  I phoned my daughter to bring my husband to drive the car and me home as I felt a bit in shock by it all.  My husband spoke to the manager and he said they had never had anybody stuck in the lift before and had no precedures in place properly.  I could have had a heart attack in it and nobody would have been able to be contacted easily its crackers. You would think as well with terrorism and all sorts that there would be more safety procedures in place He ( manager) is looking into it to see about having the alarm ring directly to his office or somebodys office so they can deal with it quickly and look into the communication with the people in the lift while they are stuck I was more concerned about being stuck with a possible nutcase rather than the lift now actually working The guy was still messing about with the lift when we left the store					2016-06-10T08:08:03+0000	1465546083	2016-06-10 10:08:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When you re giving back these clubcard points- for loyalty- for things such as hotels.. When you advise on your website that customers must call to enable them to use their vouchers  do you think you should enlighten customers that  in fact by calling  they ll have used their lovely loyalty rewards & would be best spending their vouchers elsewhere.  ¬£10 for a simple phone call to book a room at Novotel! Yikes! When i asked Tesco on Twitter I was advised that they should tell me this- nada  & to go direct to the company. Novotel stated that it s my due to ask if the call was a costing call. Now  with all due respect tesco  we are a nation of unlimited calls. We dial & unless stated  we think it s free. We wouldn t specifically ask as  most  companies notify you at the beginning of this call. Or they expect it d be minimal cost given that it s coming from a company that expressed their value as  every little helps  meaning to save money! So  my question to you  Tesco is this;  Do you think it s right that you advertise this number for your loyal customers  only to be conned the other side of the phone call?! Your go!   Yours sincerely    A future Sainsbury s customer at this rate					2016-06-10T07:30:40+0000	1465543840	2016-06-10 09:30:40	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve heard nothing since except I received an email yesterday saying my food items had been refunded  nothing about my delivery refund and no call back  very bad customer service.					2016-06-10T07:29:06+0000	1465543746	2016-06-10 09:29:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have notice something very  un-usual in this pizza. The pizza was wrapped with a insect (large dead moth). I contacted the online customer service and informed them about this issue. They advised me to send an email to  online@tesco.co.uk . I wrote the email and attached the photos as requested but got no response nor by phone or email  two days later made a call again then got put through to the store manager who arranged a collection of the disgusting pizza. Still no reply to the email. This is one of the worst customer services I have seen. So much for taking matters seriously  I am still awaiting a refund for my order.Now tesco have my pizza and my money. What kind of practice do you have in customer services? Under sales of goods act you are in breach by selling good of unsatisfactory quality.					2016-06-10T05:57:32+0000	1465538252	2016-06-10 07:57:32	2	126	2	0	128	125	6	119	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your staff were actively taking the food off the shelves.  When I mentioned this to one of your colleagues I got a very rude answer in reply. The point of a weekly food shop is to only have to go shopping once  this is important to me as I have a 3 month old baby who hates the shops. I had to get someone to watch him while I went.  I am most certainly not impressed as I don t understand why  when a store closes at midnight you find it necessary to take the most important part of a shopping list off the shelves at 7pm. What possible excuse is there for doing this?					2016-06-09T18:59:08+0000	1465498748	2016-06-09 20:59:08	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But the staff in the store where amazing   rushing to get him a wheelchair and sending for your first aid person   and then asking did he need them to phone anyone and where even going to send a staff member his home to see if he had any family  members there. When hearing he lived on his own they said they could not send him home with out a check over from the paramedics due to there duty of care.

She ordered a new one online a couple of weeks ago but it hasn t arrived yet. She can t order any more due to reaching her maximum limit  but the only advice given on the site is to phone  which due to her aforementioned hearing problems she can t do.  Any advice?

Picked my younger sister (16) up from home to go shopping for tea after work and part of my shop was alcohol! As we BOTH didn t have ID  I was refused the sale! I m 27 year old!!!! It is my consumers right to purchase alcohol if I am of age!!!!!  5 minutes later I returned with my mam and went to the customer service desk to complain but after a few ignored calls from management  I left. Meanwhile  my mam and younger sister had been to the till and purchased the alcohol despite them BOTH not having ID!  So basically  my understanding is that you would serve me if I was older OR if I had young children with me! Assuming I wasn t buying alcohol for my children!   That is discrimination and I am absolutely livid. I would like a valid explanation as to why this would happen! Not to mention the lack of help from management and me having to leave the store with no help at all on my issue!  I will not be shipping at tesco again!					2016-06-09T17:17:32+0000	1465492652	2016-06-09 19:17:32	0	13	0	0	13	12	3	9	15	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was very excited to be picking up the birthday presents I ordered from Tesco Direct ready to wrap for my daughter s 2nd birthday tomorrow. Her three older brothers were looking forward to helping me put her new slide together ready for the to play on in the morning.  I had an e mail saying that all the items had been dispatched and then an e mail saying 2 items had arrived  off I went to pick them up albeit a day later than they arrived at the store. I heard nothing about the third parcel which was the slide.  I got there to find Lewis who got together all my parcels minus the slide. I was about to call Tesco Direct to see where it was when he said he would call them on my behalf. The slide was missing somewhere thy couldn t tell me where but couldn t get one to me until tomorrow afternoon.  I think Lewis realised my disappointment and realised that it wouldn t be my little girl who would be upset  after all she will only be 2 tomorrow but the disappointment was mine  that I couldn t bring her downstairs tomorrow morning to see her shiny new slide. Lewis then handed me a gift to apologise on Tesco behalf  this gift was for me as Lewis s customer service is so excellent he realised I needed cheering up  not little Clara!   Lewis then carried my other packages to my car.  Thank you Lewis you are a credit to Tesco your service went above and beyond and you really cheered me up.					2016-06-09T17:14:47+0000	1465492487	2016-06-09 19:14:47	14	6	14	0	20	5	4	1	2	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

Over the past two months you told e by text to contact you urgently as I had missed payments both of which you found that I had paid. Whilst in Spain another urgent email I have missed a payment. I was so worried I called you and was on the phone for 20 mins at least and guess what sorry it is an error we can see you have paid. Rang Tesco when I arrived home I get an apology and we will pay ¬£20 towards my phone call. That has never been received. This is shocking service.  regards Margaret Marriott					2016-06-09T17:05:08+0000	1465491908	2016-06-09 19:05:08	0	6	0	0	6	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My hubby has just been to our local Tesco to buy Del Monte Juice ice lollies which are in a 2 for ¬£3 offer.  He picked up a pineapple and an orange pack  then discovered at the till that the orange isn t included in the offer.  So it s cost him ¬£4 for the two packs as it wasn t clear on the shelf that orange was not part of the offer.  Thanks.					2016-06-09T14:08:36+0000	1465481316	2016-06-09 16:08:36	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 17 month old daughter was playing a with a pack and took out one to clean her face and luckily just before she cleaned her face I noticed tin foil in the wipe and when I lifted the tin foil there was black sticky smelly goo underneath it. I don t know what it was but i know it s not supposed to be there. I fear to think what would have happened if I didn t see it before she cleaned her face. I am disgusted that this was left on a wipe and would like it identified and sorted straight away.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13432204_1435194653175032_1465085416936433667_n.jpg?oh=3944b5aeea7d094ca35a39d4fcfca566&oe=591AF270	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13432204_1435194653175032_1465085416936433667_n.jpg?oh=18e45c555ea12c45bf18a50652f24499&oe=58E7D265	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1435194653175032&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-09T13:49:10+0000	1465480150	2016-06-09 15:49:10	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why could you not have done the coupons for ¬£2 off a  ¬£20 shop  for say 9 weeks then i would have been able to have my fair share for shopping EVERY week with you .					2016-06-09T12:34:25+0000	1465475665	2016-06-09 14:34:25	1	6	1	0	7	6	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

For instance you have coca cola vanilla on special offer buy two for two pound. Same red label coke bottle but with slightly different colour to the writing. Big yellow label promoting the aforementioned deal. Right next to regular coke which is part of the meal deal for 3 quid?  You do the same with the water and the crisps. It s ridiculous.  Separate everything in the meal deal to one section. Or use a different colour label to highlight items in the meal deal. This whole process stinks. It s quite clear that the whole purpose is to dupe already rushed people on their lunch into picking up something that they think is part of the meal deal picking up something that adds an additional quid to the total at the till. Which at busy times people in a rush are just going to accept. Stop your cowboy tactics tescos. No wonder people are choosing to shop elsewhere.  You have gone from the store that would do anything for their customers to make shopping better cheaper and a nicer experience into a mafia of retail intent on extracting every possible penny.

My son asked if they were still doing pancakes  to which she replied  no breakfast has finished but we have cottage pie... erm  not quite the same üòÇ?! So my son had sausage roll chips a beans. I looked at the receipt & we d been charged for a large chips  there was no more than 10 on the plate. Beans were all congealed & the sausage roll was mush inside.

A few minutes later I receive a call from the Silverburn store to say my card had declined at 8am this morning.   Money was in my account after 8. I asked if this would delay my delivery. I was assured that my shopping had been picked was already in the van. They said even though my card declined they still aim to get shopping at time selected to you and they will alert the driver if no payment is made.   Error was 100% my part and Tesco still aim to deliver excellent efficient customer service. I m very happy with that. I m one to complain if I m unhappy only fair to praise when good customer service is had.

I will no longer shop in your stores with your policy that food can be returned/exchanged. I understand you state that fresh produce will not be resold but I understand that tins/packets etc will be.

Also  knowing how somw staff can be  you cannot 100% state that  2nd hand  fresh produce will not make it back on to the Shelves!

Last night I had a delivery shop booked for 9-10pm  it was the only slot I could do  as I was leaving the house at 7.30am  and not getting home til 9.15pm (my Mum was there babysitting from 8.30  so would be available to take in my delivery) AT 10.10pm  having heard nothing from you about the whereabouts of my delivery  I contacted your customer services  a lovely girl called Sophie called the store to get the drivers phone number  and attempted several times to contact the driver for me  with no luck!  At 10.40pm she called me back to let me know she d had no luck  and I was to assume my shop wasn t coming  but to wait up til 11 just in case (such great news for me when I d been up since 5am!!) She re-booked my shop to come today  but unfortunately the earliest that I can be here for it is 1-2pm slot  not a lot of use to me when the contents of my delivery included items that were needed for breakfast today  and for my sons packed lunch for school today!!!  And to top it all  she informed me that I would also be recharged for this amended delivery and then later refunded the original  not great when I m a single mum on a very tight budget  I have it  just  but it s going to leave me on a knife edge while I await the refund!  At no point in this did the store/driver ever contact me to warn me my delivery may be delayed/not arrive  and no one has bothered to apologise for the significant inconvenience of a) being charged twice  b) waiting up that late when I ve been up working all day  and c) will now have to be at home this afternoon waiting again  when I d had plans I ve now had to cancel  as I need the shopping  or there will be no dinner tonight!!  So thanks Tesco  thanks for that whole bunch of nothing I m now having for my breakfast!!					2016-06-09T06:38:30+0000	1465454310	2016-06-09 08:38:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One is the box and one is the pizza that was inside.  Safe to say there is a bit of a slight difference. There is hardly the same amount of topping actually on it.

These bags were full of bread taken right from your shelves. Some of them were packaged bread  some were loose bread from the baskets that other customers had just lifted bread out of to purchase themselves. It completely disgusted me that this bread is not going to be passed on to a charity that could give it to people in need. How is bread less than a day old  not fit for human consumption? 	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13339586_10100721989768882_8026442970675906612_n.jpg?oh=6c8fdf1cc069cc90f3fb163e5382f5f0&oe=58D810DE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13339586_10100721989768882_8026442970675906612_n.jpg?oh=dd6f4712e1a02bfd902c1135f03e0701&oe=59241CD3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100721989768882&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-08T21:30:34+0000	1465421434	2016-06-08 23:30:34	8	13	9	2	24	13	3	10	18	0	8	0	0	0	0	1	0

Nothing........ So I tried calling the number back..... No answer  I looked up our lane to see a Tesco delivery man walking up another drive  this is not close enough for me to get your delivery drivers attention! He then drives off...... No further call! Nothing! So at 9:10 I call your helpline and get told I will receive a call within 30 minutes...... Now at 9:49 nothing! Now this wouldn t usually be an issue  however on this occasion my order contains items including a birthday cake and birthday items for my son who s 7th birthday is tomorrow! So because you incompetent driver couldn t see past the end of his nose and realise the lane continued and attempt to leave a voicemail and even ring more than once (I m sure others miss calls too) I don t know when I m going to be getting my order! This needs sorting ASAP! Fuming doesn t cover how I feel right now					2016-06-08T20:52:26+0000	1465419146	2016-06-08 22:52:26	0	3	0	1	4	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well I am offended that you will stop calling them  Easter Eggs  as it is Easter and it has to do with Jesus and Easter is what the holiday is called for a reason and it is part of my religion as it is part of Christianity. So you feel it okay to offend the people of the UK who were born and bred in this country and who s forefathers fought for this country and have the religion of Christianity  yet you will not call  Easter Eggs  exactly that because you are afraid that it will offend other religions. This is an absoloute disgrace and I for one will certainly not be continuing to shop at your store. I am completely offended by this ad I am sure many others are. If we went to another country we would have to follow their way of life and respect their religion so why should other people of other religions not respect our way of life and our religion. Absolutely pathetic  you should keep calling them  Easter eggs  as that is exactly what they are as it is an Easter holiday for a reason.					2016-06-08T20:44:02+0000	1465418642	2016-06-08 22:44:02	2	13	2	0	15	13	8	5	35	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please do more to get your personal shoppers to reduce waste.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13335544_10154083622705470_4769107139287754221_n.jpg?oh=a851be8770bbcf4c58f18db8a49e2b5b&oe=5923616E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13335544_10154083622705470_4769107139287754221_n.jpg?oh=556b712b78b23c71842aa460849dd46d&oe=58D87B63	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154083622705470&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-08T19:28:00+0000	1465414080	2016-06-08 21:28:00	3	4	3	0	7	4	3	1	5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

The driver said he will take it back to the van to cut it off but returned saying he can t cut it off as it s wires that will set an alarm off. So he phoned another driver who was apparently  just around the corner  who said he had the tools for it. My driver then said he d be right back  and here we are.... 20 minutes later!!! I live in a first floor flat and have sprained my ankle and foot. I can t be waiting around all bloody night!

Can someone tell me why after years of loyalty  paying on time every month and not claiming I deserve to be treated like a cash cow for the fat cats of the board. I can get the same cover at a fraction of the cost but am told that I am past the point of no return to make changes even though I have not received any correspondence or renewal paperwork. I can only assume that your  every little helps  banner line should read  every little overprice helps us .

Due to coming out of hospital  I processed an online order last night as we had absolutely nothing in the house. As my partner works in Oxford  we live in the countryside and I m not even allowed to walk very far or drive  the online method of shopping should have been the most convenient option.   The order was due to arrive between 3-4 pm today and  at 4.30pm I decided to contact customer services as there was no sign. Customer services said that for some reason my order had been sent from Sunbury (120 miles away  as I live near Bristol) and they didn t no why. A local store provided a care package of essentials at 7.30pm however  could not provide full order as it was not reprocessed by customer services. Rang cust services again and they tried to reprocess it and it STILL attempted to deliver from the Sunbury store. Aaron then advised me to put the whole order in again from scratch  with no guarantee that it would link with my nearest store. I explained this would be extremely incovenient as I m currently unwell  especially without guarantee of successful delivery. Subsequently  I informed Aaron I d order my groceries through a competitor as there was no alternative that could be provided. I attempted to log this as a formal complaint with Aaron and requested details of the complaints procedure and was told that a response time couldn t be provided.   All I have been told today is that his has never happened before and it was an IT issue however  this doesn t solve my current situation of being without a grocery order  at the time I have requested  as I am unable to go to a shop. To be advised that the care package and a ¬£10 e-credit is suffice compensation is ridiculous  when I am still without may items required for the remainder of the week. Additionally  as I can t process my online order through Tesco  and I will be using a competitor  the e-credit is worthless. I would like to know what Tesco are going to do about this almighty shambolic excuse for convenient shopping and customer service.					2016-06-08T18:45:01+0000	1465411501	2016-06-08 20:45:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Which came from ur  baby leaf rocket salad. I just called your help line to be advised to return it back to the shop for a refund (It cost something of like ¬£1) offering a refund is a joke. I could of ate the blue wood. I was already half way through the bag which means I could of already eaten some chipping from the wood.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13393927_10154263390087940_9158330419055090499_n.jpg?oh=4c0507f5c75af6212e71f2fdb57880c7&oe=58D99944	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13393927_10154263390087940_9158330419055090499_n.jpg?oh=a6ec2d7f6086cc0361c42276570af5ca&oe=5919C449	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154263390087940&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-08T18:19:43+0000	1465409983	2016-06-08 20:19:43	1	14	1	0	15	14	2	12	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I applied for a job  answered all the screening questions  uploaded my birth certificate as proof of nationality and right to work  only to be rejected as it wasn t the A4 size full birth certificate. It is MY birth certificate  the one my parents got when they registered my birth 41 years ago. So how come it s not good enough for you Tesco? Now I have to send off for my full birth certificate if I want to work for you? Thanks for putting a barrier in my way to find work.					2016-06-08T18:15:22+0000	1465409722	2016-06-08 20:15:22	0	7	0	0	7	7	5	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your usual template reply just isn t going to suffice this time I m afraid and as a (ex) loyal customer I m angry and disappointed at how we were approached by one of your security staff ordering my 15 year old son who suffers severely with anxiety  is on the autistic spectrum and recovering from agrophobia to remove his hood which he wears all the time to make him feel safe. He did not say  excuse me  we have a policy etc  he rudely said  hood.. take it down  motioning for my son who had a communication disorder to remove the only thing that allowed him comfortably to be stood in a busy supermarket  something that is a colossal challenge to him. Apparently no hoods are allowed to be worn in your stores because it prevents identification... except his face wasn t covered and he was needlessly embarrassed and distressed in public. However if he headwear on for religious or cultural reasons he wouldn t have been approached. How about personal or medical reasons? Elderly ladies in scarves? Hats? Where do you draw the line? I can understand helmets or bandanas but a boy shopping with his mum? I have provided all the details twice now and would really like to know what has been done to prevent further similar unnecessary treatment of your customers with mental health problems and suggest you review your unfair clothing policy. Where are the signs on the door? Also if you need to speak to someone  you should quietly take them aside. Just really disappointed with this and with being ignored. Your mission is to  treat people how they want to be treated  what a joke.					2016-06-08T18:10:53+0000	1465409453	2016-06-08 20:10:53	6	12	6	2	20	12	5	7	11	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been on a long and perilous quest to find and conquer the elusive Tesco clubcard. I ve tried in vain to lure one through my letter box for many years now  I even tried bribing the postman with dog biscuits  I hear they like those. Alas  he wasn t privvy to the secrets of attaining the precious Tessco Clubcard.   I was strong willed at the beginning of this journey  but sadly I ve grown weak and bitter through lack of clubcard points  I almost rugby tackled a woman last Tuesday for rubbing it in my face that she was purchasing so much avacado and spinach for free using her points.   Goodness knows why one would spend precious clubcard points on nasty green tree eggs  doesn t she know what I d give for such points!?  My car is so desolate without the fuel top ups I ve been promising her for years  one day I keep telling her  I ll lavish you will all the petrol points.   In all seriousness Tesco - what s a gal gotta do for a clubcard? I ve signed up for one three times now and have never been sent a card. Think of all the tree eggs that I could have bought considering I shop there weekly. They think I don t want them. Well  I don t want them but we mustn t let them think that. Please Tesco  end my quest and send a clubcard through my door? (preferably loaded with three years worth of missed points but I m not too fussy)					2016-06-08T18:01:29+0000	1465408889	2016-06-08 20:01:29	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The food shop included a bag of Tesco Petis Pois. Upon having cooked the peas in a saucepan and sat down to ate them  I noticed a rather odd looking pea. Like it had lost it s colour. It felt all squishy too. I was just about to eat it too as  it s just a weird pea.  My partner stopped me. It was a MAGGOT. There was a maggot in my peas. A cooked maggot now. Which I nearly ate. Looking at it properly it s very obvious what it is and I am now disgusted. I am a vegetarian too!!!  My mom said  at least you know they were fresh . Very unhappy about this...  I took photos too :)					2016-06-08T17:50:27+0000	1465408227	2016-06-08 19:50:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly after being in the store for 5 minutes I got an announcement for my car registration to go to customer service. When I got there I had been told someone had come off their motorbike and ran into the back off my car in the torrential rain. As the rain was so bad I didn t want to take my baby out to check the car so the customer service ladies said they would keep an eye on him whilst I got the details. They were lovely.  Secondly as the rain was bad one of the gentlemen got me an umbrella (which he couldn t get under so got soaked) and came outside with me to check the car.  Then once I had actually done my shop the whole front of the store had flooded so they were letting people out the side exits. As my car was in the child space at the front entrance I had no choice but to go out this way. (This point the water was above my ankles). One of the ladies helped me get my shopping out to my car even though she herself had to step out and have water upto her ankles and still have to work with wet feet and pants. They also wrapped my baby in a towel so he kept dry and gave me one to put over my head.  As they didn t forsee what would happen in the torrential weather they acted very quick and were very patient with everyone. Although I am now sopping wet and home I would like to thank all the staff for there help!! üòäüòäüòä.					2016-06-08T14:55:19+0000	1465397719	2016-06-08 16:55:19	35	10	35	1	46	10	5	5	5	0	35	0	0	0	0	0	0

The fresh chicken I ordered was flagged up as the use by date was Friday. As I intended to cook this for Sunday lunch I said I would like to return it.  The driver whose name is Marcus accepted my return but offered to check back in store to see if a fresher one was available. Sure enough he rang me later to let me know he had one in stock and delivered it to me this afternoon when he was back in the area.  I am very impressed that he did this for me and have notified your customer services team by telephone so that he gets the recognition he deserves! :-D üöê üëç :-D					2016-06-08T14:38:06+0000	1465396686	2016-06-08 16:38:06	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The current advertisement showing the range of returns now available has caused alarm bells to ring; as it shows a woman returning home after her shopping and deciding she would prefer a Pineapple rather the Watermelon. She goes back into store and does a swap!   Im sorry but i dont feel that any type of food should be returnable under  any  circumstance especially a change of mind once home. This is a violation of Health & Safety Concerns; considering the world we live in I dont trust anyone at all to take home a piece of fruit or other foods to be returned and possibly mishandled or worse injected with anything harmful or life threatening.   Yes some may argue  well we eat out or bring home takeaways; how can we trust them  in my defence at least I have the assurance that the person providing the food is known to me and I would trust this person/s more than some random could be psycho want to hurt people deliberately.   Well this has really made me reconsider shopping at Tesco s.   These are  my  concerns and obviously everyone else may have their own reservations which may be positive or in my case negative.					2016-06-08T14:35:55+0000	1465396555	2016-06-08 16:35:55	8	6	8	0	14	6	2	4	5	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ordered 2 meals & drinks in the cafe costing ¬£16 but had to leave most of them due to the excessive temperature and unbearable stuffiness in the cafe. The air conditioning was not working & there are no opening windows or doors except a fire exit. It was approx 75F degrees according to the thermometer on my phone. We consider this to be a health and safety issue  not only for the customers  but for the staff as well.  Before we left  we complained at the Customer Service desk. We would welcome your comments & confirmation that something will be done about this. Keith and Julie Norton.					2016-06-08T14:00:29+0000	1465394429	2016-06-08 16:00:29	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We only have 5 minutes per drop as we have other customers to see to .   This is the first time that a driver has said this. in fact all of the other drivers had helped me to check them off.  When I asked him what would happen if I lied and said that things were missing afterwards (I wouldn t do this of course) then he said I report it afterwards.  Is what he says correct?					2016-06-08T13:33:54+0000	1465392834	2016-06-08 15:33:54	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Nowhere does it say that you cannot use the card for groceries and it took a couple of failed attempts and then a google search to find out that you are  working on it . This is quite disappointing. Can you reconsider the way it has been worded on the gift voucher please because I have wasted my time now thinking that I could use it as you can with all of the other main supermarkets.					2016-06-08T12:28:21+0000	1465388901	2016-06-08 14:28:21	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The milk you sell is not produced from cows that enjoy their natural habitat outside in fields grazing on grass!! You get your milk from cows that never see a field and are inhumanely kept indoors - Unbelievable!

We were at Martins Heron Tesco and when they got to the car a member of staff ran out and gave her a bunch of flowers. According to my mum she joked to my dad that she wanted him to get her more then a 5p bag for her birthday  to which the till operator overheard and called her supervisor over. Without my mum realising they had got her some flowers but mum and dad left the front doors before they found her  going after her to the car. This has really made her day! Thank you for such a kindness!					2016-06-08T09:36:23+0000	1465378583	2016-06-08 11:36:23	7	4	7	0	11	4	2	2	3	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Colleagues have had no formal letters informing them how much money they will lose each month. There are people worrying about how they will survive and they have had no confirmation of exactly how much worse off they will be. There is talk that one to one meetings will commence after the 16th June? This is disgraceful these pay cuts are due to take place from July 3rd and colleagues have had no confirmation from Tesco about who is affected and how badly.  You have to ask   Are Tesco deliberately leaving it as late as possible because the losses are higher than they have indicated?Are they deliberately delaying so that there will be minimum bad publicity as a result of these pay cuts?  Come on Tesco at least show your long standing loyal workers a small bit of respect by giving them the vital information they need so they can make decisions about their future.  Or better still DON T CUT COLLEAGUES PAY!					2016-06-08T09:26:06+0000	1465377966	2016-06-08 11:26:06	2	5	2	0	7	5	5	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Those tablets you chew to show how dirty your teeth are. I wasn t bothered by brand  just needed the tablets  There are none on the dental aisle  so went to the pharmacy. The two members of staff were unsure what I was asking for initially  and then the pharmacist said she had never sold them before  and then laughed and said  Oh I m looking at them!  and retrieved a box from under the counter. She handed me them and asked if that was what I was after. It was! Yippee  I thought  at last we can buy them. For some reason the product wasn t priced  and I was asked to go and do my shopping whilst they located the details on the system. I had no shopping to do  but when faced with rows and rows of food  two children and it being evening  I was tired and easily worn down into purchasing items we really probably didn t need  apart from a bunch of bananas! After a long walk around  I returned to the pharmacy and was told that they couldn t locate the price on the system and so couldn t sell it  the product was being removed from sale and to return this afternoon or leave a telephone number IF i wanted to speak about it. Well  I have to admit I was annoyed  and more annoyed that if I had been told this straight away I may have had time for one final dash to another place which may have sold them. I needed the tablets for this morning. You made a bit of a healthy profit out of my shopping last night but you have one miffed customer who finds  it intriguing you have items in stock with no price. Also intrigued a pharmacist would not understand what I was asking for  I had to give a long description and in the midst of all that she walked away to serve another customer!  I do have a bunch of bananas though..........					2016-06-08T09:17:21+0000	1465377441	2016-06-08 11:17:21	0	3	0	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered a fridge with delivery on 6th  on 6th we been told it will arrive 8th  on 7th we were told it was never in stock - a mistake on the website  and will be delivered next month. I appreciate that mistakes happen but we took holiday to wait for the fridge  it would be really appreciated if you would at least let us know before 11am that the delivery will not happen so I can get back to work. I am not glad that we helped you to correct a mistake on your website  it costed us time and money  now waiting for a refund  as a compensation got an apology.

I fail to see how this can be a good idea !    I know there is a view that people could touch the items in store  and contaminate certain unpackaged food items   but this is not the same as a melon rolling around in the boot of someone s car   and on a kitchen work surface where they feed there cats !!					2016-06-07T21:34:12+0000	1465335252	2016-06-07 23:34:12	0	9	0	0	9	8	2	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My personal online shopping experience with Tesco has been overall very positive but I would like to be able to purchase things from the superstore  such as more American goods and Krispy Kreme products  through online shopping.   I have health problems that keep from shopping in person  so this would be an excellent improvement.   Also  I have disabled friends who love the customer service from Tesco. They have been massively impacted by your recent increase in the minimum spend which has caused them to stop using your service. Would you please consider lowering the minimum spend for people who are less-able to physically get to your shops and do a shop in person?   I look forward to your response.					2016-06-07T21:03:38+0000	1465333418	2016-06-07 23:03:38	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As my daughters television was becoming increasingly faulty I would just like to thank you for sorting an exchange out within 24 hours! What a service! Leah was delighted when I told her that Santa had sorted it with our local tesco so that she didn t have to interrupt her plans of a my little pony marathon after her homework!

The stock levels are diabolical. I normally spend 150 a week doing a weekly shop for 5 and recently I have walked out part way round due to not being able to but lots of my basics. Today for example the fruit & veg was completely empty apart from the odd bruised or short use by stuff so I turned around and went to my local Waitrose where I spend more but at least I get my shopping. It has been like this for a while now and seems to be getting worse. Rubbish shop					2016-06-07T20:42:50+0000	1465332170	2016-06-07 22:42:50	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an order and went to collect on the 18th May  it was raining very heavily  so Mr Tesco Man offered to put it all in my car whilst i stayed in the dry. I got home  unpacked and discovered i was  missing  a bag... It just so happened to be milk for us  milk for our baby  cheese and yogurts. Somewhat disgruntled that i then had to go out again i rung Tesco and complained...    1st June i open my car door to go to work and was attacked by  the smell ... Mr Tesco Man had put the  missing  tesco bag in my bag of bags in the back of my car and i hadn t seen/found it. My car had been on the drive for a week (in 25oc heat) with said bag in it.

I would just like to suggest you chat to your staff at your Hove branch (Denmark Villas) and mention to them that deciding to clean the entire white wine chillers out on a Tuesday evening at 8pm is not very conducive to customer convenience  when most people fancy a glass of white wine after a hard day s work. Doesn t seem very convenient to me. That s half an hour s worth of my life I m now not going to get back after having to shop elsewhere. Thanks.					2016-06-07T19:49:04+0000	1465328944	2016-06-07 21:49:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apparently the factory that the stir-fries come from have no glass in the factory and in fact tried to say that must ve been glass in our wok when we cooked the stirfry. Seeing as the glass wasn t even that sharp you could tell it hadn t just been broken. So it was obvious it had to have come from the package even if we hadn t seen it ourselves. Then they try to say that apparently they ve had independent testing and there was no food present and Had never gone through any sort of cooking process. so one minute they re telling me it s glass from a jar of some sort of cooking sauce which we don t use and then they saying it had no food traces on it. Can t have it both ways. Manager then went on to offer me ¬£25 on a gift card so if they don t feel guilty why would they do that? I just feel that as a big company like Tesco s there should be more concerned with the fact that a child and a piece of glass in their mouth!!!!					2016-06-07T18:19:38+0000	1465323578	2016-06-07 20:19:38	0	11	0	0	11	11	3	8	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Luckily I noticed this before taking a mouthful after curiosity made me take a second look at what I believed to be a piece of brown or burnt rice. I won t pass comment on the physical outcome discovery of said insect yielded while this is being discussed in a public forum. However  I would ask that you confirm to whom I should forward additional photographs and accompanying complaint regarding the Caterpillar I found in my  Tesco Thai Chicken Green Curry with Jasmine Rice  today? I would also like confirmation of any details relating to hygiene standards and checks carried out at this meal s point of production. I m sure you can appreciate that as the production staff are clearly lackadaisical enough not to notice insects in the food being prepared  it s not unreasonable to be concerned about what else they are not checking.

She spotted a pink pair of light up shopkins wellies and asked if she could have them.  We got to the till and they wouldn t scan   we were then told because they weren t on file we could not purchase them. I left with a very upset crying 5 year old and would like to know why they are on the shelf if they cannot be purchased   this is ridiculous.					2016-06-07T17:11:53+0000	1465319513	2016-06-07 19:11:53	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked in store today when the promotion starts for Tennents with the GAWA N.I glass  to my shock and horror I was told they may not be running this promotion in Tesco s stores due to offending others. If this is true Tesco s I m deeply saddened that you have decided to take this line of action and cave into the Green and Orange debate in this country  we live in a society which is shared and the only way to move forward is acceptance. I would say if Ireland done the same glass for Republic Of Ireland it would surely go on sale also.  This is a way for Tenants to promote their beer through the Euros as you cant buy the glass online  which means the only way that the general public can purchase one is that they go to a bar. I don t want my post turned into a political debate as I would not offend anyone from a different culture but keep it in mind its not only consumers from one community that would like to get these glasses.   I will not name the store as I would not wish the member off staff to be disciplined over this but I m glad I asked the question as they were only telling the truth to customer.  At this I would like to wish both Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland all the best in the Euro s as I said acceptance - Moving forward.					2016-06-07T15:19:52+0000	1465312792	2016-06-07 17:19:52	18	15	18	5	38	15	7	8	7	0	18	0	0	0	0	0	0

Lots of products no longer available or replaced with cheaper  nasty alternatives. * Mattesson s firedogs have gone * Finest Thai prawn fishcakes have been replaced with tasteless Salmon fishcakes * Lovely Bright Salad replaced with lower quality Bistro Salad (which goes brown very  very quickly... no wonder there are tons on the shelves) * Delicious Shin Cup noodles no longer around * Easy peel Clementines have gone (replaced by satsumas with around 1 billion pips per segment)... OK  this one might be seasonal.  Is this a general shift by Tesco to get rid of decent produce and replace it with poor quality alternatives (like your nasty new  Boswell farms  (etc) ranges)?

My brother who has learning disabilities came in last night wanting to help my disabled mother purchase some cat litter  unfortunately he didn t see it had a rip in the bag  and when he bought it out to the car understandably my mother didn t want it in there! He took it back in and was told by the security guard to come back tomorrow because customer services was shut  despite the fact he had a receipt from 5 minutes before in his hand. My brother tried to explain why (which I shall explain further) this isn t an option  and the security guard responded with  well I have to get on a bus to get to work from Cowes  which is entirely ridiculous  irrelevant and rather rude ...My mum lives on the other side of the island and has very restricted mobility  and coming back the next day isn t an option  it s 8 miles away (in Cowes)  and she comes late at night to avoid the crowds. I find his response very interesting when your recent advert shows you will  exchange a watermelon for a pineapple  but apparently your security guard won t allow an exchange to a faulty bag of litter (which would make a mess over the car)  that s ripped open! Maybe you should add * in office hours only * and offer return petrol or fares  if an item is faulty outside of office hours. What do you think? (I ve since discovered that my mum was so tired  she actually gave him the money to buy a long life fabric bag to place it in rather than walk into the store to deal with it) I m willing to bet that had mum gone in  it would have been replaced.					2016-06-07T12:07:52+0000	1465301272	2016-06-07 14:07:52	0	2	0	1	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just a couple of things though... the vegan sour cream - ewww. Compare it to Tofutti s Sour Supreme and you will understand what I mean. Also  vegans REALLY need more (and interesting) ready meals. A lot of your Indian and other world dishes might qualify but I m guessing the confusion between allergen and vegan is holding Tesco up? But there is a huge market for interesting meat-free food that doesn t rely on cheese  eggs and cream etc for its taste. Talk to me  I d love to help!					2016-06-07T12:04:06+0000	1465301046	2016-06-07 14:04:06	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was already easy to roll but this new improved stuff needs hardener to stay perfect on a cake as the new recipe rips and tears on cakes. I ve had quite a few experienced baker friends experience this as well as myself. It s fine for modelling roses or shapes but if you want to cover anything MORRISONS it is  Paul sugarcoat school has a good review too. Has anyone else experienced this problem?   @kaylamadecakes					2016-06-07T11:49:58+0000	1465300198	2016-06-07 13:49:58	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I automatically picked the petrol up but realised before I even put it anywhere near the car.  As I moved the nozzle to replace it and pick the right one up the readout suddenly jumped from ¬£0.00 to ¬£0.06! No fuel had been dispensed  not even by accident. I called the big guy out to the pump who said  it wasn t unusual and some times the pump read the trapped fumes ?!?   According to the station worker it  happens all the time ! I know it s only six pence but I think it s unacceptable. We pay enough for fuel already.   According to trading standards:  the internal volume of the hose can change due to internal pressure forcing more fuel into the hose. This effect is called ‚Äòhose dilation‚Äô and is simply the hose swelling slightly. The error in such cases  if any  is very minor and well inside the permitted pump error tolerances of -0.5% to +1.0% !  This was not within the permitted pump error tolerances and I hadn t even started to pump fuel.					2016-06-07T09:40:40+0000	1465292440	2016-06-07 11:40:40	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Thought I d message and say a huge thank you to Tesco Shettleston whose staff made my shopping trip with my beautiful newborn daughter and toddler son possible! I d fallen asleep doing the online shop the previous night so went to the store buggy and babies combined. A member of the staff saw I was struggling with a clingy baby and a double buggy and a basket. He offered to bring me a trolley that d take both kids and take my buggy to customer service for when I was finished. He came back with a trolley and an ice cream for my toddler. Sounds simple but made my day.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13339584_10153855546154011_207774104372059427_n.jpg?oh=fb3d45076fbeaee945b70d9e34d65e44&oe=58DBFA24	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13339584_10153855546154011_207774104372059427_n.jpg?oh=87df060ae50f7eaedaf3631b813c0196&oe=58E0EE31	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153855546154011&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-07T08:37:46+0000	1465288666	2016-06-07 10:37:46	1192	21	1225	18	1264	18	13	5	61	0	1180	32	1	0	0	0	0

O am sick and tired of your delivery drivers thinking it is perfectly acceptable to block my driver so I can not get my car or any other car off my drive or even onto my drive when I am returning home. I have been made to wait and told by your drivers that they won t be long and even when asked to move they have said as soon as the delivery is done. I have even resorted on one occasion to blocking your driver in when I could not get onto my drive after returning home from work he did not seem happy when I said to him I won t be long when I m finishd doing what I m doing I will move my car.

I purchased one of your half leg lamb joints with my online shopping (delivered on Sunday from your Croydon dotcom centre) Whilst carving the joint it turned out to be more fat and gristle than meat  the pictures aren t the clearest but the plate is a side plate  that s all the edible meat from a 1 kilo joint!  The quality of your beef is always brilliant but I m not sure I d spend out on your lamb again. On the plus side  your quality veg and potatoes went some way to making sure we still enjoyed our meals!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13413717_10154265436196289_5273759367933314369_n.jpg?oh=a24d712f22ba930bf653af3310b920be&oe=58DCF541	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13413717_10154265436196289_5273759367933314369_n.jpg?oh=b6ace58e8c6a4e3d108d977eadae1399&oe=58D9674C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154265436196289&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-06T21:44:05+0000	1465249445	2016-06-06 23:44:05	2	7	4	0	11	7	2	5	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	2	0

I ve tried to shop with you twice in the last couple of weeks. The first time I walked in and there was a sign advising that customers could not purchase any items from the chillers. Ok  you have a problem. Frustrating  but fair enough.   Fast forward over a week later and I try to come and shop with you again. All the covers are on the chillers. I asked a lady who works for you if this was still an issue from the week before. She told me there was a problem with the gas  the chillers have been reaching 9 degrees and we could buy the food for the next 15 minutes  and they were being told to sell it  but she wouldn t buy it herself. She also told me the engineer had been this afternoon but had left without fixing anything. Honestly I found that quite shocking and worrying and left without anything from the chillers.  Please resolve this situation ASAP for the safety and wellbeing of all your Walsall customers.   Thank you.					2016-06-06T20:43:43+0000	1465245823	2016-06-06 22:43:43	2	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered some food and a personalised cake from your easy entertaining range for my son s Baptism.  When the delivery arrived the very nice delivery driver handed over my items then went back to the van to collect something.  She returned with a bag saying it was from the dot com team. When I opened the bag I found a lovely gift and handwritten card for my son signed from Robert and the dotcom team at Tesco Bathgate. I was so thankful that someone had the thought and had taken the effort to do such a kind thing. The team at Bathgate needs recognition for this kind act.					2016-06-06T20:31:46+0000	1465245106	2016-06-06 22:31:46	240	7	242	26	275	7	7	0	7	0	236	2	0	0	0	0	0

Recently I ve noticed everyone seems to be going to the  budget  supermarkets and seem to be very pleased with the quality. However I wanted some nice lamb steaks and olives etc so thought I d go to Tesco as usual. Here s the lamb I bought. Apparently it s quick and easy. From the side that pointed up in the packet it looked lovely. However the first millimetres hid the fact that it was 90% fat. It also tasted musty and not much like lamb at all. Dreadful. Even the cat wouldn t eat it. The olives also seemed to be about 2 years old. Hard on the outside  mush inside. Disappointing. I ll know where to go to next time.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13406803_10153546346636316_3790778998321637081_n.jpg?oh=7eff600fb7f63e2b2a0f52c477bb1aac&oe=591FA5B9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13406803_10153546346636316_3790778998321637081_n.jpg?oh=496020e3fb82967e604f1c7899826361&oe=58DA23B4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153546346636316&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-06T19:50:42+0000	1465242642	2016-06-06 21:50:42	3	6	3	1	10	6	6	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

When the clubcards points recently came out for last month  I printed my ¬£5 voucher using the machine instore and then using the machine again I scanned the ¬£5 voucher to boost to a ¬£10 voucher to use in store. I decided to keep it for another time and unfortunately I misplaced the voucher so it was unused. I wrote on here asking and I was told by a member of your social networking Facebook page that I would be able to go in store and easily have them print one out for me as obviously it was unused. I went into store and they said they would be unable to do this despite being told on here I could  and to ring up Clubcard. I rung them up and they said the same! So I am very disappointed to have been given conflicted advice and my ¬£5 (¬£10 boost voucher) has literally gone to waste!					2016-06-06T19:48:57+0000	1465242537	2016-06-06 21:48:57	1	14	1	0	15	14	1	13	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have multitudes of cards and don t always carry them all. So when I do my shopping im left with a receipt and the prospect of trekking back to the store to add points............. Make it so people can stop wasting their time and customer services  so we can add the points ourselves online.   2nd please stop making us collect points and then send me vouchers off if and when I spend over a silly amount or on things that I would NEVER buy  its wasting my points and does not benefit me.

What happens to the food returned by customers changing their minds? Is it a)  Thrown away? (in which case it s an appalling waste)  or b) Put back on the shelf? (IMO  a distinct  if small  risk of someone having tampered with the product) Either way  not a policy I like  and I will not be purchasing whilst this policy is in operation; nor will the only other person I have spoken to regarding this.  Do you think that maybe your policy needs a re-think?					2016-06-06T19:26:15+0000	1465241175	2016-06-06 21:26:15	2	22	2	0	24	19	2	17	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now just to set the scene  I walked to the branch about 15 minutes away  I am currently 8 and a half months pregnant with my 2 year old daughter  it is very hot outside and I had promised her all day that she could have an ice cream once we got to tesco if she was good all day.  So off we went  as she had been good all day. I am at the till with all my shopping and realise that after scanning everything I had left my purse at home. So my daughter that had clutched this ice cream the whole way around the shop  was now looking at me totally heart broken when I said she couldn t have it.  So she is now crying  I am literally on the verge of crying  when the customer service lady sees I am clearly struggling and offers to help me  I explain the situation. And she then crouches down to my very upset 2 year old and asks what s wrong  I explained about the ice cream to which she replies  well we can t have that  you come all this way and your not going to get your ice cream  you just wait here   She then produces a ice cream for my daughter and say  enjoy it    So now I am crying but with utter happiness and disbelief at what had just happened.  The cost to tesco was 50p the cost to me and my little girl is priceless. And I will Never forget.

I bought a bag and they took so long to cook then went lumpy while mashing. I thought I would give them another go and the same thing happened.  They are really bland and do not mash well..there used to me a great selection to choose from.

However last week the H364 ink cartridges in Tesco  Kingston  Milton Keynes at ¬£5 were on offer at 3 for 2. I bought the 3 colours  paying ¬£10 to give them a try. So far the quality has been really good and I am very pleased with them. I was not pleased however when i returned to the store today to purchase additional cartridges making use of the 3 for 2 offer and discovered that the individual price had been increased to ¬£6.50! Can someone explain how the price has increased on this offer in a week?

Kyle the gentleman that served me found my son on Facebook and messaged him saying he d found the other part of the order.

During the warmer months we make the most of the great fruit selection available. Strawberries are a favorite and the quality is usually good. Unfortunately yesterday the box I received was filled with berries that have very obviously had some sort of insect making a meal out of them.. Some have small holes  but most have fairly large gaping holes in them  making the majority of this box unappetising.. Im surprised  as usually the quality is great - I d hate to think there was an infestation at wherever they were delivered from..	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13335901_10206723707073712_1149714967296351714_n.jpg?oh=bccc299cb93e5b5608acfc6b92d9afa9&oe=592043C2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13335901_10206723707073712_1149714967296351714_n.jpg?oh=d33d54d21fc6aef376341052d4849488&oe=58DAFACF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206723707073712&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-06T05:37:29+0000	1465191449	2016-06-06 07:37:29	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We picked up a Click and Collect order yesterday and  apart from a little confusion with the guy there (which was sorted  maybe he was new?) everything was great with the order. My only complaint is that the melon we collected yesterday is completely bad. It s slightly mouldy on one end  has gone a funny colour and is sticky to touch. It almost looks like it was bad before it was frozen and it s defrosted yucky! I wasn t really planning on returning to the store over the next couple of days  and I don t really want to keep a rotting melon hanging around in the warm weather. Are you able to re-fund me without a return?					2016-06-06T05:04:48+0000	1465189488	2016-06-06 07:04:48	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We needed some pain relief for my daughter who had hurt her thumb.  Being on holiday we didn t know the layout of the store or where to go for medical treatment. A big thank you to one of your Employees Julie who was busy when we approached her for help in one of the aisles.  Not only did she stop her work & take us to the correct aisles  she chatted to my daughter to cheer her up & gave us full details of where to find the minor injuries unit near where we were staying. ..even offering to write down directions. She offered useful information on where to park  which part of the hospital to access etc which when you re away from home meant & unfamiliar with the hospital meant a lot.  What a lovely employee! Please say thank you to Julie for making an evening trip with a child in pain less stressful . x					2016-06-06T01:47:28+0000	1465177648	2016-06-06 03:47:28	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This has been bugging me for months now. Your tesco light mayonnaise jars  the large ones  are always a battle to open. My husband struggles to open every one we ve brought over the last 6 months  it s like they re welded on! If I was an elderly person I d never be able to get into them  in fact I can t now without my husband opening it first  it s ridiculous!					2016-06-05T20:09:45+0000	1465157385	2016-06-05 22:09:45	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought a table and chairs to try and enjoy summer while it lasts and it never arrived. Was due for delivery on 28th May. We got a txt and email confirming a two hour deliver time and they were a no show. We had no contact from the courier or tesco to say there was a delay and we had to cancel our plans that day as we didn t know if they were just running late. Contacted customer service they said they would phone back  heard nothing. Contacted them again Thursday and got told again they would look into and phone back Friday at 4. Still no call. Phoned again on Friday night  apparently two team leaders looking into it and due another phone call yesterday. Should have known better. No one can tell me where my delivery is or when we will get it. Absolutely terrible service and I expect better.					2016-06-05T19:42:21+0000	1465155741	2016-06-05 21:42:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went into the Launceston supermarket today (05/06/16) to stock up on groceries. I got to Martins checkout at about 3.55pm (just when the store was about to close) and realised I d lost my card - my only method of payment. I explained to Martin that I should go check for it in my car  so he held the shopping at the checkout. On my way to the car  I explained my situation to Giles (who I think was a store manager). Despite all of my panic  Giles made me feel human again  telling me about a recent time when he d lost his card and reassuring me it wasn t going to be an issue. He then told me the store would pay for my shopping  whilst we looked for the card. Not only did the store pay for my shopping  but Martin packed my shopping and even brought it to the door for me. After a quick search of the shop  Giles checked for my card at the customer services counter  which had already been closed for the day. It had been recorded that it had been handed in. I m so incredibly grateful for the finder of the cards honesty. The customer services worker  Ali  who was just about to go home  set down her bags and reopened the safe where it had been locked away.  Amongst all of this  what Giles  Martin  Ali  the finder of my card and tescos didn t know was that these groceries were going home to stock up the emptying cupboards of my Dad and I - My Dad has dementia and I am a student nurse on placement and in exam season. I cannot explain how much  these multiple acts of kindness have blessed and have helped us. You have completely changed my perspective of supermarkets. Dad and I are so overwhelmed and so grateful by all of the kindness shown and we ll think of you during our mealtimes this week! Thankyou  thankyou  thankyou.					2016-06-05T19:28:30+0000	1465154910	2016-06-05 21:28:30	62	1	62	0	63	1	1	0	2	0	62	0	0	0	0	0	0

(I m not in any physical pain but I feel if I don t let out my emotions it could lead to that). I used to wake up on a Monday morning and look forward to the walk to my local store. The brisk breeze wafting through my locks  the frosty fog on the tip of my nose.   Upon entering the store I could see nothing else but what my dreams entail. Shining out to me like a star in the night sky. Hello. I see you. The Chicken Chorizo Wrap (No Mayo). I sprint  like a gazelle. Shirley from round the corner doesn t matter at this moment in time  she s getting floored. That sandwich is mine.   The first bite is succulent  and I think  Today is going to be a good day .   Now  to the sad part of this story. I cannot seem to find this wondrous wrap anywhere  has is been discontinued? If so any left over wraps you have please get in touch and send them all to me. Every single one. I ll pay  oh god will I pay.					2016-06-05T18:30:14+0000	1465151414	2016-06-05 20:30:14	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They are all rather soft too.  On a plus note the guy at click and collect was amazing and so helpful. He took the time to have a quick chat with my 5 year old son which he does every week when I do my click and collect. It really helps make a rather boring job much nicer.

Why on earth do you give Orangina ( fizzy drink ) fridge space?. It s an over priced fizzy drink that s nowhere near worth the ¬£1.67 you ask for it. If I were you I wouldn t even entertain the stuff until the robbing manufacturers bring the price down. For 20p less I can buy your own brand 100% fruit juice which is double the size for 20p less. Please  get rid of it!					2016-06-05T16:03:03+0000	1465142583	2016-06-05 18:03:03	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just got my car back and one of my headlights is now dead. But beat bit is they have broken my ¬£600 touchscreen stereo head unit.   I my car back to be told they didn t really touch it. Well that s funny as was dusty as hell and now sparkling!   I also witnessed prior to collecting my car someone being taken away from cleaning the car and told off about something.   When at Halfords paying to have my headlight bulb replaced I asked them about what had happened. They sold me and fitted the stereo just month ago. They said it clearly sounds like something was sprayed on the touchscreen.   To say I m mad is a understatement.					2016-06-05T15:46:12+0000	1465141572	2016-06-05 17:46:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The driver was most ignorant towards me.  He knocks at the door and then walks off leaving me standing there for approx 5mins and then proceeds to sound like he broke glass on his way up the garden path  then whilst handing me my shopping barely spoke.  There was nothing of the normal Tesco greeting at delivery or communications about lateness  or from driver whilst handing me my receipt  no information about no substitutions. Actually  I found him to be quite off  for want of a better way to put it.  Other drivers I have spoken to have been quite friendly even when I have spoke of my issues with Tesco.  This is been of many times that Tesco Bedford have sprung me along or messed up my delivery and yet when I speak to them they do nothing  except waste my time.  To top off this experience  just got phone call from a lady called Connie at Bedford Tesco and what has basically been a waste of my time and 10 minutes of my life I won t get back.     Please  please  please put Biggleswade back in Baldock Tesco catchment area - their service is something much better and so much more on the ball  never had any problems with Baldock Tesco.					2016-06-05T15:32:25+0000	1465140745	2016-06-05 17:32:25	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After a hard mornings graft in the garden I popped in for a few bits for the BBQ but left with so much more. Minstrels will write songs about this day  and when my time comes I will pass the title on so that it will live forever  but just in case I ll let you know what happened...  I was trudging my way down the ever familiar central isle in the store when I heard a hushed whisper. My ears twitched and my palms got a bit sweaty - the  Yellow Sticker  gun had come out  and this reduction was one not to be missed. It was at this moment I knew my time had come to step up  be a man and hunt down said bargains to bring them home to my approving family.  After vaulting over an abandoned shopping basket and narrowly missing the lad stocking the shelves whilst blocking 2/3rds of the isle I arrived and the meat reduction  Hotspot . I instantly was greeted by the disapproving head shake of another dad who I had clocked drifting through the bread isle earlier  kids clinging on for dear life. This was my day not his   I guess we missed it  I joked hoping to throw him off the scent. For a second our eyes met and I knew I had a rival on this noble quest.  I dashed to every other reduced area in the store but 1 - the fruit & veg isle. Having a keen eye I had previously walked passed this usually bountiful stop and registered it as empty before my quest began so had discounted it. I ll hold my hand up  I was wrong - I was a man and we make mistakes  but now I m a King I have to set an example and admit them.  I was leaving defeated and convinced my rival had beaten me - how could I face my family with this amount of shame on my face. And then I saw it  in all its golden aura  the promised land. The previously empty reduced fruit & veg hotspot contained a tray of strawberries  not 25% off  not 50% off but 10p... A box!!! None was missing  I was the first to find this haul.   I loaded my trolley with 8 boxes  leaving a few for the peasants I knew would follow me and wheeled my way to the checkouts smug as anything. Then I saw my rival loading his checkout a broken man  I grinned & winked - it was at this moment I knew I had become something bigger than before. I had been Crowned King of the Yellow Stickers.  So Mr Tesco I will leave you with this  for 80p I got ¬£16 worth of strawberries and a coronation. I will spend the afternoon planning an invasion on the neighbouring lands and pickling my insides with said fruit. You enjoy that 80p  buy yourself something nice & treat yourself. For today you levelled me up and my newly upgraded bargain skills will no doubt allow me to live like a king for the rest of my days.  Big love.  King of the Yellow Stickers	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13346595_1121325827930426_5702963608094551320_n.jpg?oh=ec34d5f86a191c5a643be19fc1c0595e&oe=58DF1A72	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13346595_1121325827930426_5702963608094551320_n.jpg?oh=7dc17987b6cbd0f05b2e0df5e83af14e&oe=5923D467	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1121325827930426&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-05T15:16:06+0000	1465139766	2016-06-05 17:16:06	2509	580	2979	909	4468	490	276	214	3354	0	2480	95	1	365	0	0	0

My wife booked a lovely 1week stay self catering in Dorset.My wife spent a long time ordering our good n drink for the week online with tesco and was due to be delivered between 8-9 pm.We were in our accommodation from 5.30 onwards.After 8.30 had passed I thought I would phone and check  That that the driver could find us this is when i found out I had no phone or wi fi service. So walked off site till I could get a phone signal to phone customer helpline.I was told delivery had been attempted and failed  and returned to store .The man I spoke to said that they would attempt to redeliver on an Emergancy delivery slot and would come later I gave full instructions and waited till 10.45 before walking off site again to to phone again to be told that there would be no delivery and that it was not down at all to be delivered!!! She offered a morning delivery but I refused as I was so angry and disappointed  with Tesco. I had to ring again as I realised that pay ment had been taken and was told that this would take 3-5 working days ??? Due to this inferior service we have had no food for 13 hours and only water to drink.  We had ordered ¬£172.18 worth of food and drink for our weeks stay and I m now sat outside MORRISONS with our 2 dogs while my wife is shopping when we should be relaxing enjoying the start of our holiday.  I don t believe enough effort was made to deliver our shop as there are places he could ve gone to for directions and our accomadation is easy to find and I gave directions when I phoned even giving our car description to make it easer Only to be told later there was never an intention to redeliver at all. One woman I spoke to gave me a ¬£10 voucher which I find insulting after all this.  Had I been told it wasn t gonna be delivered I could have driven to Tesco to pick it up.  Also we have had to Pay out again for food do places and things we were gonna do we now can t because we have less money.  The whole experience has been upsetting and left us feeling angry and unimportant Tesco I feel did not offer or deliver good service for which I know they strive for.

Today the raspberries are mouldy and was told that they were delivered within the freshness guarantee  but as a gesture of good will theyd refund on this occasion.   Oh thank you tesco.   Call me crazy  but 2+ would mean that i would have a BB4 date of the 6th. Or unlike other grocery retailers  are your policies a bit misleading? 2+ days would indicate that they would be fresh for a minimum of 2 days not 1.375 Days.					2016-06-05T11:50:36+0000	1465127436	2016-06-05 13:50:36	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Without water which was a bit strange and they have wilted. However do theses flowers look like tulips and 35 of them as advertised on your website. I brought the tulip abundance from you for my mothers funeral which is tomorrow! I know need to go out and find tulips else s where with very little money. You have failed. If I buy tulips I expect tulips or at least and email saying why you can t get me tulips and a refund.

So have been munching on the fruit..  had some with breakfast  and some throughout the day too... just decided to have strawberries and cream for pudding (hadn t planned on eating them all in one day!) so as to not waste them and I see this little slug climbing all over them...

But you know what? That s just fine. You can keep your camping chairs  Asda sell nicer ones anyway. And to be honest I only ordered them from you to bump my order over the ¬£30 so I didn t get charged for having my stuff delivered to your store. Since you didn t keep your side of the bargain I ll have a FULL refund for the chairs you have failed to provide in the time frame agreed  thanks.   Id tell you to stick the lot but the rest was paid for with Clubcard Boost  so I ll keep my bargains!  Utterly useless company. I won t be bothering with Tesco Direct anymore. Bad delivery service is one thing  that s acceptable. Shoddy customer service is inexcusable.					2016-06-04T20:45:12+0000	1465073112	2016-06-04 22:45:12	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My husband and I ordered our shopping online and opted for click and collect at the Meir store. For some reason our order hadn t reached the stores system. The staff and management couldn t have handled the situation better  they quickly gathered our shopping together  whilst treating our three young children to snacks and drinks to keep them entertained. The staff promptly came out with our shopping along with a bunch of flowers for myself! I would highly recommend this store and will certainly be going back. The staff are an absolute credit to your company.					2016-06-04T20:25:45+0000	1465071945	2016-06-04 22:25:45	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well done Tesco Crewe  and especially well done Donna.üôÜ					2016-06-04T15:54:42+0000	1465055682	2016-06-04 17:54:42	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Part of the order is ready for collection so I checked tracking on the other two items and apparently a card was left? For a store collection? And my item appears to be in Northampton even though my store for collection is Wolverton. Also  the parcels origin appears (according to the tracking) to be Fenny Lock. Which is only a few miles away from Wolverton though my parcels have gone on a nice little trek around Leamington and Northampton. If your tracking is to be believed your carbon footprint must be staggering! Anyway  any chance of finding out when my parcels will actually be ready for collection? I m guessing it won t be today as promised!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13394127_10154325431762048_8960779239679117105_n.jpg?oh=62e2b0d00c7993be959111842e8e618a&oe=58E5A346	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13394127_10154325431762048_8960779239679117105_n.jpg?oh=af75b41ad3012a88548d1d7579f870dd&oe=58E80B4B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154325431762048&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-04T15:34:11+0000	1465054451	2016-06-04 17:34:11	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The lady behind the butchers counter was chatting to my mum who mentioned that the food was for her 90th birthday party. Twenty minutes later at the checkout we were approached by a supervisor and the butcher lady  who had a large bunch of flowers for my mum. The lady had gone to the trouble to tell a supervisor and then search the store for us! Amazing customer service by Tesco. Made mine and my mums day.

Today whilst doing the weekly shopping in tesco copdock (ipswich) my 3 year old had the biggest meltdown ever  there were tears  there was screaming and there was hyperventilating  to be frank I wanted the ground to swallow me whilst I put on a smile and tried my best to calm him down without giving in to his demands (I m sure all parents have been there at somepoint) but the point is the staff in the store were so helpful and didn t make me feel judged to the point the cashier scanned and packed another customers shopping whilst the customer helped me to the car with mine! It really was the best and most appreciated customer service so THANK YOU!!!!!					2016-06-04T15:11:00+0000	1465053060	2016-06-04 17:11:00	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you explain the reasoning behind only stocking this product in England & Wales now  it was previously available in Scotland but for some reason you ve now stopped supply to your customers north of the border.

The manager trying to justify it by saying he was English didn t help. It s time big companies realise that Wales is NOT England. Sell the English stickers by all means  I m sure some people will buy them  but your main eye-catching Euro 2016 displays in Wales should be promoting the Wales team.

Mainly the strawberries. Standing for ages looking through boxes to find some that were half decent  to only be able to use half the box and if they weren t eaten that day they d have to go in the bin. Then Thursday you started stocking these Perfectly Imperfect strawberries. Cheaper  bigger and amazing quality. Even 3 days later today I am sat enjoying a bowl of them still fresh and tasty.

I m absolutely disgusted in this and I hope you have something coming into your stores which is for same sex couples instead of only  male & female couples.  I would love to hear your excuse as to why this store (if it s the only one not stocking these items) has not got them.

As a parent with two children  that can be best described as the omen crossed with Dennis the menace. I find myself occasionally reliant on a nice glass of wine to relieve the stress of what is a constant ufc fight in my house.   So on Friday evening I popped in to your Bletchley store to pick up a bottle of my favourite wine (after long day and facing kids and wife in battle at home much needed). Picked up a few impulse bits and headed to the wine aisle. Being a regular I can pretty much traverse the aisle and pick up my wine with the same fluidity of an Olympic relay handover. As I reached the wines usual location stooped down. In readiness  reached to collect  to my horror the shelf was empty.   While normally this would not be an issue  as it s a nice wine and may just be sold out   on closer inspection it appears no!! MY brand is now discontinued üòØ  it gets worse in selling off the stock the price was reduced to ¬£2.75 a bottle üò≤ (at no point was I informed of this) I am also at a loss as to who bought the remaining stock as before it was reduced I seemed to be only one purchasing and the shelves were normally full.   The story does not end there  I then in shock and reeling from this discovery realise I have to pick a new brand  I start looking (for reference my previous favourite was vineyards hill Merlot from Chile price ¬£4 a bottle) I discover a new merlot  but wait there is a very similar name this time mountain vineyards (hmmm seems lot like my old fav) then I have a thought maybe I am saved and it s just a rebrand  hold on let me check price  ¬£4.75.   I have to say the cynical side of me starts to think my good friends at Tesco could be tricking me into paying more for what is essentially the same product.  Using some basic mathematics I looked at my average purchasing and the new price and realised over a year this devious ploy will cost me around ¬£100 a year more üò•.   You can obviously understand my disappointment and I am sure can sympathise with my plight now of having to try an parent without my favourite wine.					2016-06-04T10:52:57+0000	1465037577	2016-06-04 12:52:57	2	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Surely it would be sensible to offer the sugar free version on the offer....feels like you were pushing the full sugar version rather than the sugar free at a time when sugary drinks are in the news over sugar tax. Am wondering if it s a political stance against the sugar tax  or if tesco is just into pushing heavy sugar drinks?					2016-06-04T09:10:33+0000	1465031433	2016-06-04 11:10:33	2	12	2	0	14	12	5	7	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The cashier (since she refused to give me her name; I can only describe her appearance and my time of visit; she was approx 6 feet tall african lady with a red tesco shirt with no name badge and blue tesco trousers; I went to the store approx 7am 03/06/2016) I told her that i was looking to get a 10 pack of menthol cigarettes and asked if she could slide the shutter covering the cigarettes so i can pick one of the packs. She said in an abrupt tone   which ones do you want  we have many different ones.  I reiterated that if she slides the shutter open then I can have a look. She slides the shutter and let go saying   well if I slide it open it will just slide back shut again . I told her she could have kept the shutter open for a few seconds by holding it and told her which pack i wanted (i had managed to catch a glimpse of one of the brands). This is not the first time cashiers at tesco express have been rude; they seem to get really annoyed if you ask them to leave stocking up and come to the kiosk; however when buying booze or cigarettes we don t really have a choice.					2016-06-04T06:48:17+0000	1465022897	2016-06-04 08:48:17	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Popped into Tesco on the bath rd in Maidenhead today next to the Windsor castle. Pub. Watched them throw away 4 full trays of croissants  bread rolls  and pain au chocolat. I asked the guy if they were really all going into the bin  and not to the homeless shelter (Susan Brett - volunteer who allegedly promotes the Maidenhead homeless shelter and I d happily Collect)  but he informed me that no  Tesco prefer to bin rather than give to local charities or to allow staff to take them home. What a disgrace and what a waste! #tesco you should be ashamed of yourself. Help The local community!! Give some kids a breakfast. What a joke. I ll be writing to them tomorrow. Please follow suit and let s make them invest in the local community or produce less food for waste					2016-06-03T23:49:01+0000	1464997741	2016-06-04 01:49:01	16	10	18	1	29	10	7	3	3	0	16	0	0	0	0	2	0

I was served by an older gentleman called Phil who noticed that something wasn t right  he told me to take my time and to let him know if I needed any help with my shopping or getting to my car.  He was told by a supervisor that it was his break after he d finished serving me so instead of taking his break immediately  he told me he would help me to my car to make sure I got there safely and help with me with my children. This is the kindest gesture I have ever experienced in a customer service sector. I cannot express how much I needed and appreciated this.   Please give him some recognition for his actions. He genuinely deserves some praise for going out of his way to help.   Aim√©e xx					2016-06-03T22:12:55+0000	1464991975	2016-06-04 00:12:55	4	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	0	0	4	1	0	0	0	0	0

They contain palm oil. Why do you large retailers use it in almost everything  knowing that it is hugely contributing to rainforest destruction and the push towards extinction of orangutans and other species. So these species are killed and driven from their homes for cheap sweeties?? You have to take responsibility for your part in this. I wont buy anything that contains palm oil again. Step up and stop using it.					2016-06-03T21:35:05+0000	1464989705	2016-06-03 23:35:05	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Do I have to ask them to pick longer dated products on everything I buy? I m tired of throwing away things like bread  fruit  milk ect two or three days after its been delivered because it s already out of date! And yes  I am well aware that you can eat things past this date  but when it comes to mouldy fruit  I draw the line especially as it s not really that cheap to begin with!					2016-06-03T21:34:52+0000	1464989692	2016-06-03 23:34:52	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Get home  quick shower  pick up other half s socks off the floor  and go to stick my prized pizza pie in the oven. My mouth waters a bit when i see all the pepperoni piled on top of it and my pulse races a little as I go to rip the box open. Take the pizza out and... Alas! The pepperoni that had initially made me so excited is now my cause for disappointment as the whole amount of delicious meat is concentrated solely in the open bit of the box which you can see through. Now I can be partial to a conspiracy theory but I m going to choose to believe that you didn t do that on purpose and it was an honest mistake. Also  what do I think about the illustration on the packaging which shows generous helpings of pepperoni adorning the pizza base evenly and generously? A little heart breaking to have to settle for a-quarter-pepperoni-three-quarters-meatless-pizza after a long hard week of trudging if you ask me... I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13321837_10207649659052011_205405773201959449_n.jpg?oh=935c0e3b92ba648312a3bbf7f0357695&oe=58DC5CDF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13321837_10207649659052011_205405773201959449_n.jpg?oh=28a18210d80acd1ddf92902150588643&oe=58DE81CA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207649659052011&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-03T20:35:11+0000	1464986111	2016-06-03 22:35:11	9	9	15	1	25	9	8	1	18	0	9	0	0	6	0	0	0

We had just got a tiny 8 week old puppy for my disabled sister and needed to pick some things up for him so thought we d pop into my local Tesco for them.  Upon entering  I was holding the puppy in my arms and my sister next to me  the security guard gave me the filthiest look and insisted for health and hygiene reasons the puppy needed to wait outside  under normal circumstances I would ve accepted this however I explained my sister is disabled and epileptic (she has had several fits in this store previously) and can not be left alone so if the puppy waited outside that would mean either she s wondering tesco alone or she s stood outside alone. This is not acceptable she can not be alone. He proceeded to tell me it s  tough  and she would need to stay outside. I didn t continue to argue we just left the store and went to Asda instead who were more than helpful and understanding towards my situation. His attitude was a disgrace and he s let the store down big time today! That will be the last time I enter a Tesco store because clearly they do not have any understanding or compassion to the disabled.					2016-06-03T19:18:17+0000	1464981497	2016-06-03 21:18:17	2	14	2	0	16	14	4	10	15	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Under the sale of goods act it has to last a reasonable length of time - obviously 22 months for a 260 quid dishwasher is not a reasonable length of time.  However unfortunately James AAF0 and Anthony RJ59 in your call centre are not aware of the sale of goods act and just spout about a 12 months warranty after which it is the buyers problem.  I am sure that Tesco is aware of the sale of goods act and will of course honour its provisions without my having to go to the small claims court to have my rights upheld.  Please advise how I can get this issue resolved as quickly as possible because I currently have guests to stay and no dishwasher.

I was shopping with my children and they asked to have a go. The eldest won 2 prizes with his 3 goes  middle one won one prize but the youngest didn t win anything. I let her have one more go and the shop assistant  helped her choose  the next 3. Low and behold this time she won a small gift. It s the little things like that which make us loyal to Tesco. It wasn t anything other than a small act of kindness but it made a little girl happy.					2016-06-03T16:53:52+0000	1464972832	2016-06-03 18:53:52	24	6	26	2	34	6	1	5	1	0	24	2	0	0	0	0	0

I m sorry to tell you this   I thought we had a good relationship but it seems you have been cheating on me with cheap trash.  Each week I find you have let me down  each week we talk it over and you tell me it ll never happen again.  I must have been a fool because I kept believing you  and kept coming back for more only to be let down by you again.    I won t bother calling you this week  I don t want to hear you say you are sorry  that you ll try harder  that you ll change.  Because I don t think you will.  Last week you brought home to me a punnet of nectarines none of which were edible  I had similar things the week before  and the week before that  and the week before that.  Your new produce range is terrible  cheap  trash.  This week  you sent me apples with great gashes in them and worm infested potatoes  and you expect me to stay with you?  I call you  like a fool  and listen to your apologies  well  this time I m off.  You re dumped.  You cannot compete with the likes of Aldi and Lidl in terms of quality because you cut that to bring down prices. You lied to me Tesco.    See ya round  let s not pretend we can still be friends  nobody likes a repeat offender.

Missed a call from the driver  called back straight away  no answer. Have been going back and forth through the customer service centre. I ve tried the driver several times and left a voicemail  no response. This started at 11am  it s now 3pm  and I ve only just got to the bottom of what is happening. Re-scheduled for 8pm tonight!! Not good enough Tesco  that s our lunch and dinner ruined  and my babies  nappies  milk and wipes not here. I have the same slot every week as all the items see us through each week. Today we have nothing now. Not to mention the waste of a day chasing this and waiting on calls back. I am fuming  the drivers lack of courtesy and common sense  and ignoring my calls. I will be cancelling my delivery saver plan and shopping elsewhere.					2016-06-03T13:53:46+0000	1464962026	2016-06-03 15:53:46	0	9	0	0	9	9	4	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today  however  I am so annoyed! Last week for the first time I bought a Tesco branded cartridge for my Cannon printer (that I also bought from Tesco about a month or so ago). I bought the 540XL cartridge as it seemed the best value. Imagine how annoyed I was today to go to print a couple of invoices from a cartridge that has only printed about a dozen sheets in total to find the error message comes up saying the ink cartridge is EMPTY!! I have tried all the tips that the internet tells you to reset it but no - it DOESN T WORK! I am working away all weekend now so don t have the time to take it back into the shop. Suffice to say I won t be buying Tesco own brand printer ink ever again!					2016-06-03T12:41:00+0000	1464957660	2016-06-03 14:41:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The man says oh they need to be refunded if i didn t want them groaning. Then he said the fresh items weren t to clever either. So Thanks for wasting my time. So I get home with 1/3 of my shopping.   ALWAYS CHECK YOUR CHILLED FROZEN BEFORE YOU LEAVE IF YOU DONT WANT FOOD POISONING    Who checks the Temperatures? CUSTOMERS? Going to contact the food safety team at Winchester city council.   Here come the excuses.....					2016-06-03T12:40:03+0000	1464957603	2016-06-03 14:40:03	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just spent 2 hours building a trampoline  then when trying to do the top ring it snaps clipping in and slices my finger! Ring tescos  told they will ring plum for spare part. They then ring back and say they don t do the part on its own so they re sending a whole new trampoline out. Now I ve got to find time to dismantle this one around 4 young kids  one being a baby before they come and pick it up. Well I thought logic and asked if they couldn t just take the poles out the other box and just send them. Nope can t do that  because instead they want to make my life so much harder!! Finger was worse than picture  I had it pressed into my clothing before coming in. Won t be buying things like this from tesco again that s for sure.

I was very frustrated to find that this method of presentation has now been discontinued on your fresh fish counter and I was directed to pre-packaged salmon sides or portions. I am astounded that you have chosen to do this as salmon is very popular.  I have now been to another supermarket and purchased it there as I do not want pre-packaged  older and more expensive salmon. I have noticed recently you have discontinued/no longer stock a number of items I used to regularly buy..... To the point I can no longer do my entire weeks shop with Tescos  I have to do half elsewhere (Morrisons/Sainsburys/Lidl)  Another question.... Why are all your carrots currently from Israel?  They are the most watery and tasteless carrots I have ever had.... Even the rabbits won t touch them. I also wonder why you chose to source them from Israel when you actively promote and educate  Farm to Fork  to the local children in store.  I have seen these sessions and to the best of my knowledge at no point is importation on a jet or shipping container mentioned..... Just explanation about local farmers harvesting.  While I can appreciate some produce cannot be sourced from the UK  carrots are not one of them.  Please either buy British or stop mis-educating our children as to where their food is coming from.  Yours sincerely  Frustrated Tescos customer.					2016-06-03T11:42:10+0000	1464954130	2016-06-03 13:42:10	5	4	6	0	10	4	2	2	0	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	0

She had bought 2 packs of them as they were in a multi-buy offer but is now scared to eat any of them.  Should we take them back to the store for a refund?  I feel that this needs looking into as the whole batch may have been contaminated.					2016-06-03T09:59:05+0000	1464947945	2016-06-03 11:59:05	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I didnt bring her pushchair as i know supermarkets normally have seats for babys on their trolleys and being a single mother i could not have pushed a trolley and pushchair at the same time.   The first thing that threw me was that the trolleys with the baby seats where shoved in the middle of a huge line of normal trolleys. Resulting in me having to pull them all appart to get to it. When i finally reached one i noticed the seats where filthy! Not suitable for a small baby at all. The second and last one i came across seemed fine until i tried to strap her in and noticed the clip was broken - clearly very unsafe. As a single mother this made my shop incredibly difficult. I have attached a photo for your reference. As you can see one side of the clip fits nicely where the other half has a part snapped off. Please advise on how you will address this. Many thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13327444_893573220754865_1251131351699977194_n.jpg?oh=0a9c7ae6038eaaee453ffe498290d64d&oe=58DDD49E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13327444_893573220754865_1251131351699977194_n.jpg?oh=c5df92e27009800ccada08555a530041&oe=58EE0B61	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=893573220754865&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-03T09:55:24+0000	1464947724	2016-06-03 11:55:24	3	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I had been in hospital all bank holiday weekend and discharged late Sunday evening. By Tuesday I  felt  up to getting a few bits in  as I was starting to go a little stir crazy. Any way  off I pop to your Uttoxeter store to gather by necessities. All went well  went to a self check out area  paid and left. Perfect! Or so I thought?! It turns out  I hadn t been my usual  with it  self. It came to yesterday lunch time  came to pay for something else and realised...well panicked...I had lost my debit card. First call was to the BF  no he didn t have it in his car. Second call to Tesco s customer service  explained my predicament and the lovely gentleman went away for a moment to check. Great news they had my card. Fantastic! All I needed to do was pop in with some photo ID and collect. Now all of this I would imagine is quite ordinary  but I wanted to say thank you and congratulate your staff on their fantastic customer service. From start to finish  they were polite  helpful and all round very understanding. The gentleman on the phone  the lady that greeted me at the store with a smile. It made the whole experience  that could of quite easily be a negative one  an un stressful smooth process from start to finish. And please please please  pass on my thanks to your staff at the store.					2016-06-03T09:26:07+0000	1464945967	2016-06-03 11:26:07	1	3	1	1	5	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yes  I had had them for 2 years but I was saving them up and realised I d be able to use them in the very last Boost and get some great presents for my daughter that I haven t been able to afford on maternity. I have explained on Thursday 26 Mat my dad passed away and printing my vouchers and exchanging them in Boost went from my mind. On 1 June I went to print the vouchers and realised what had happened but after one day all that information has gone from every part of their system. Even the email (pic below) isn t enough to get them to help me. The amount spent to get ¬£26 worth of vouchers is huge and under these circumstances when I could take a little bit of pleasure in getting something extra for my baby has been denied shows that Tesco don t care at all. I ve been offered 100 points goodwill which equates to ¬£1 to spend in Tesco. I will be taking my custom elsewhere from now on as they clearly don t care to keep me as a loyal customer. I don t believe there is no way the information I have provided can be checked and honoured under these difficult circumstances.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13307217_10153982692605589_6553041653653035098_n.jpg?oh=78e605c3d9d586d3ee46c93f0222efe1&oe=58D96D5D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/13317028_10153982692605589_6553041653653035098_o.jpg?oh=cd3543f92dd35b786a643e66cca0eb1f&oe=58E6332B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153982692605589&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-03T00:28:35+0000	1464913715	2016-06-03 02:28:35	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Well  it all started when i was feeling rather peckish (long day in work  the usual deal) so i decided it was time for my daily trip to tesco to pick up a sandwich or a light snack to have on my way home. all was going well  the only difference being  this time i found myself in merthyr  so i went to the tesco there instead of the one in aberdare. after browsing through the selection (and there was a fair bit considering it was late into the evening  so good job on that) i decided to go for the chicken  tomato and basil pasta (a favorite of mine  that i only get sometimes because they dont stock it in aberdare  very strange)  anyway i make my purchase  and proceed home  thinking of the delightful taste of the pasta that will soon be in my mouth. but when i got home  disaster struck. i sat down  ready to enjoy the pasta in all its glory  and peel back the label covering for the plastic fork  only to find that the fork is absent!  i was now faced with a life changing decision  to leave the pasta  unopened  or to go and get a fork and add to dishes that i dont want to do  wasting valuable time and effort after a long day of mind crushing  soul eating work.  as im sure you can appreciate  this was a hard decision for me to make  and one that no decent human being would take lightly.   i am not writing for any sort of compensation or refund  i just ask that you ensure that this horrible occurrence is prevented  so that no other poor soul has to endure the pain and struggle that was set before me today.   thank you for your time in reading this.  kind regards  your pal  your buddy  your chum  your pasta loving mate  Ross.  p.s. i ll probably just get a fork.					2016-06-02T21:19:14+0000	1464902354	2016-06-02 23:19:14	0	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Hardly any chicken and virtually no broccoli. might as well call it deep filled air pie with nothing but a tasteless white sauce. Absolutely rubbish and waste of money.

Order number Y9CHBPBG I ordered a silent night memory foam mattress last Friday night.  I paid for it using clubcard vouchers I have saved up for a long time.  The order said it would be delivered on Wednesday 1st June and an adult would have to sign for it.  My husband took the day off work yesterday to be here when it arrived.  He rang to ask where it was at about 12.45  he was told it was with yodel.  He rang again at 4.45 and was told someone would chase silent night and get back to him.  I rang approx 6 and was told it probably wouldn t be with us on June 1st but they would try and make sure it was delivered today.  I complained that the email told us it would be June 1st and my husband had taken a days holiday and that tesco should not offer this service if silent night cannot deliver.  Today at 11.30 I received an email to advise me my mattress would arrive tomorrow 3rd June.  During the afternoon I took the dog out and there was no one home  and I received a text from my neighbour to say the mattress had been delivered to them at approx 2.30. I arrived home  got the mattress only to find it was the wrong size  we had ordered king size and we now have a double mattress in our hall.  My husband called tesco at approx 6pm to be told silent night had gone home and he would be advised tomorrow afternoon on what would happen next.  I am very  very annoyed in 3 main areas 1. It did not arrive yesterday despite our order confirmation email telling us it would 2. It arrived today when no one was home despite an email advising us it would be here tomorrow 3. We do not have the product we ordered  Please advise by return how this situation will be resolved and what compensation you are going to give us for the inconvenience caused when all we wanted to do was buy a mattress and not have all this hassle. Thank you Amy shepherd					2016-06-02T19:36:12+0000	1464896172	2016-06-02 21:36:12	18	1	18	2	21	1	1	0	0	0	18	0	0	0	0	0	0

What s to stop people taking food home and tampering with it then bringing it back? For example I m sure many students have injected watermelons with alcohol for summer parties.  What s to stop someone buying a melon injecting it with any liquid and then bringing it back. I buy it  feed it to my son who gets incredibly ill or worse. The same is true of any food item.

I have ordered 2 cakes for Saturday. One for my daughters first birthday and one for my other daughters 3rd birthday.  Have been waiting all week for an email asking what messages I would like written on the cake.... Have just got off the phone with customer services after being told there has been a problem with emails being sent to customers  and no one would not received an email and now it is past the cut off date to add messages!  Well that s helpful considering you have quite happily taken ¬£50 off me for the cakes  As a gesture of good will you have offered me a voucher for not even half of what these cakes have cost me  but you have left me with no option to take it with less than 2 days till the cakes are needed for!! It also doesn t really make up for the fact that the cakes will not be as I wanted as you could not provide the service that you offer with your cake decorating......  So thanks Tesco  pretty sure I won t be using your services again..... what a complete let down!					2016-06-02T18:44:41+0000	1464893081	2016-06-02 20:44:41	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Anything could have happened to that watermelon. Where is your food safety?  If that watermelon is thrown away basically because someone decided they no longer want it that is also food wastage. So many hungry people in the world. Basically Tesco that advert is wrong on so many levels. Sort it out.					2016-06-02T18:40:33+0000	1464892833	2016-06-02 20:40:33	6	2	6	1	9	2	2	0	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I picked them up after the film had finished  and he noticed that my daughters shoelaces were undone and as my hands were full he did them up for her  while asking her and her sister all about the film  he then opened the car door for me and closed it!!

Doesn t seem like an improvement to me. Topcashback was what helped me grow my points balance faster.   As a Tesco Clubcard customer who has earned points with TopCashback before  we wanted to let you know that the 31st July will be the last date that you will be able to exchange your TopCashback payouts for Clubcard points.    Our relationship with TopCashback is coming to an end as part of the improvements we are making changes to the Tesco Clubcard scheme to make it simpler to understand and easier to use. We have heard from our customers that they want to grow their points balance faster  and get more value back from their usual shop  so we will be focusing on creating more ways customers can earn points at Tesco. Keep a look out for special opportunities to earn bonus points in store and online.    There will be more news to follow  but if you have any questions please visit tesco.com/clubcard.    Thank you for being a member of Tesco Clubcard.  Your Tesco Clubcard Team					2016-06-02T18:10:26+0000	1464891026	2016-06-02 20:10:26	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The advert shows a fresh product being returned because the buyer didn t fancy it  so what will they do with all returned food? bin it? surely they can t re sell unsealed products. I never usually get my knickers in a knot about adverts but there is far too much food wasted already.					2016-06-02T17:55:59+0000	1464890159	2016-06-02 19:55:59	4	14	4	0	18	14	6	8	18	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is an opportunity for the whole country to support the national team  to get together and enjoy a long overdue national spectacle. It is 30 years since this opporunity last occured  30 years in which the country is supposed to have reached a peace between the communities  30 years in which attitudes are supposed to have changed and 30 years in which we all should be able to celebrate our national football team s success.  I m therefore very disappointed and frustrated that a very small minority of haters and agitators have forced a large national company to remove items which could help all the people support the team in France. Many of these few protagonists chose to deliberately be offended in order to ferment a bigger row than it ever needs to be. By pandering to these few  instead of backing the many  you weaken your commercial position. I for one  will no longer shop at Tesco until this is resolved satisfactorily to the majority of decent citizens trying to support a fully inclusive national football team.					2016-06-02T17:43:53+0000	1464889433	2016-06-02 19:43:53	5	6	5	2	13	6	3	3	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

It doesn t bother me that much what offers or promotions you do or don t do but please don t pretend that it s for the benefit of the consumer!  On another note I remember a big thing about Tesco removing certain products to help customers make a healthy choice  if this is truly the case why have the salads  sandwiches and fruit bags/pots in the fridge as you enter my local store been replaced with alcohol?					2016-06-02T17:33:14+0000	1464888794	2016-06-02 19:33:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No notice to local residents of this starting and no signs posted. for a Car wash that when I read the planning proposal looked like the opposite side of the car park. Cheers I work permanent nights so I m going to really enjoy listening to the sounds of Pressure washers  Music and more People than normal every day of the week. Not like there isn t 3 other hand washes  within 2 miles either so not really sure of the need for this. Don t appreciate the snotty attitude of your managers either who just say its not their problem.   Great attitude to have toward those local to your stores on top of the parking problem created by your stff and customers who will not use your own Car Park ..					2016-06-02T17:07:44+0000	1464887264	2016-06-02 19:07:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have prescription toothpaste. The last time I took my prescription there they gave me an unknown brand instead of my usual known brand. I asked on this occasion that they make sure they give me the known brand. The woman behind the counter answered. You will have to get the dentist to write that on prescription because he has written the generic brand. I again specifically asked for the brand which I have always had. She answered the government won t pay us for that brand because it is far too expensive and if we were to give everyone that brand we would be out of business. My answer to her was  well in this case every little bit doesn t count . So much for your health care promise Tesco. Shocking! Anyhow I want you to know Boots the chemist gave me the known brand without question. I will never use Tesco pharmacy in Mold again.

I m delighted too say that they parked outside my shop ALL day today then left at 3pm  just to be followed by another staff member of Tesco s to park in the same spot. I would understand if there wasnt parking spaces but there is further up  obviously staff are too lazy to walk and don t care because they are on an hourly wage unlike myself. They couldn t park closer if they tried! How are my customers meant to carry sacks of feed if they can t even get out the door properly? I find this very rude and inconsiderate to us small business that have been here years before Tesco s  as it is the local butchers is closing  not because of Tesco s but because of their staff parking.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13344671_10154212050521740_8789487964208222357_n.jpg?oh=7370efe9550a5d07c848202ce6181061&oe=58DB36BF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13344671_10154212050521740_8789487964208222357_n.jpg?oh=3626b4dfe62b3041c55e6b5a13bc08f4&oe=591918B2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154212050521740&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-02T15:10:19+0000	1464880219	2016-06-02 17:10:19	12	20	16	2	38	18	10	8	21	0	12	0	0	0	0	4	0

So you have delivered some to my house today  bb 3rd June - All well and good. So my son decided he was going to have some for lunch  except 6 of the 16 strawberries in the pack were so soft they went to mush in my hand.  While I realise strawberries have a very short shelf life  selling strawberries that obviously weren t in the best condition is not one of your best ideas.

The only reason i m not seriously injured or dead is because i came to an emergence stop on a main road.  Again i just thought i would let you know!

We have a fundraising day on Sunday and have just been let down by our supplier for burgers and cheese slices.   Would Tesco be able to help out with this charity event in supplying these (300 of each) either as a donation or a cheaper price?   All the money being raised is going towards building an indoor riding to allow all year access to riding facilities. This greatly helps for instance  children with autism keep their routine going all year.   Thanks for reading and hope to hear from you soon.

I went in looking for specific items which I couldn t find so I decided to ask a man who was walking past me. He replied I don t think we sell it and continued to walk off without even attempting to look or ask someone else. I then was already very unhappy so I hunted down another member of staff...hunted being the correct word as trying to find anyone to help in that store is like trying to find a openly gay man in Russia  it s virtually impossible. I did however find a girl speaking with four other colleagues near the till area so I approached them and waited  and waited whilst they glanced at me and carried on talking. Eventually once they had finished discussing their weight loss tips one girl said  you alrate there?  I proceeded to ask if tesco stocked a certain product and she glanced at me like I was a unicorn and said I have never seen one so probably not  then walked off.   Not only are the staff very very unhelpful  they really have no pride in what they do and they definitely don t care about your customers. I regularly shop at the tesco in alfreton where the staff are very friendly. Maybe a training course on how to be professional should take place soon.   Thanks for nothing really. Maybe you should change the motto of  every little helps  to  can anyone help!?    Thanks					2016-06-02T13:27:59+0000	1464874079	2016-06-02 15:27:59	16	6	19	3	28	6	3	3	3	0	16	1	0	2	0	0	0

Well I ve phoned your customer service team  but this was before I realised how outrageous the packaging on my order really were. 7 huge boxes to package 3x22l boxes (all separately with masses of paper padding  but some common sense was used and the bin was put in one of the crates)  1 laundry basket covered in bubble wrap  3 shoe boxes (all together finally) and 2xhopscotch number playmats (both in separate boxes and with excessive paper once again). And there was even a flat box WITHIN a box! I now have to find a way of storing all of this until the recycling is collected next week in my flat (thank goodness I am not limited with the amount of recycling I can put out). And I also need to find a way to bag it all up so it s actually taken by the refuse collectors.  This is the most wasteful  environmentally damaging and unfriendly practice I have ever come across. I will post the photos I managed to get as my toddler wasn t enjoying the lack of space and the inevitable mess is unbearable.   I have a feeling that you made a huge loss on my order. The cost of postage  packaging and staff costs would ve barely been covered by the almost ¬£30 I spent. This has put me off ordering from you ever again and I will actively tell friends and family to avoid such unethical practices.					2016-06-02T12:41:46+0000	1464871306	2016-06-02 14:41:46	0	6	0	0	6	6	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will look forward hearing your response.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13335776_10154274135379824_5606309761530265574_n.jpg?oh=fddfe24014ec4cadbb218ac8e45f0114&oe=58E65E86	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13335776_10154274135379824_5606309761530265574_n.jpg?oh=bebb22a591da6d76c0c80bd2f1784c37&oe=58E2CE8B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154274135379824&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-02T12:37:38+0000	1464871058	2016-06-02 14:37:38	6	8	8	0	16	8	7	1	1	0	6	0	1	0	0	1	0

Quite regularly she goes into the Belmont store in tescos and everytime items in the freezer are above the load line.  She has regularly found the items on the top have defrosted and when brought to the managers attentions the just shuffle it about and put the defrosted item towards the bottom to refreeze.  Last time she went in this happened with a frozen turkey that was soft to the touch and again this got pushed down to be refrozen.  Everytime she speaks to a manager she gets fobbed off  last time the new manager stated  oh I ve heard about you !  Your Belmont store don t seem to understand that defrosting and refreezing items makes people ill.					2016-06-02T11:56:27+0000	1464868587	2016-06-02 13:56:27	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Product returned and replaced but Customer Service Manger based in Dundee seemed to think this was our fault insinuating we had damaged it in the car. Initial letter regarding the faulty goods received on 24th May which declared it was a water spill. This was followed by a phone call from me to correct misunderstandings and a request for a call back. No further contact from Tesco so I called today to be virtually accused of damaging this bottle. I have shopped in Tesco for many years and spend a considerable amount of money with them. Is it too much to ask that somebody apologises and at least offers to contribute to the cost of valeting the orange juice out of the boot?  How sad that Tesco customer service is non existent anymore.					2016-06-02T11:20:02+0000	1464866402	2016-06-02 13:20:02	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Are you for real?   I called your head office on seeing this advert for the first time and was told YES  it was right.  Aparrently fresh food is binned and anything else is put back on shelves. I work in the medical field and let me say in the nicest way that many people don t have scrupulously hygienic houses. I for one DO NOT wish to purchase second hand food even though  packaging is intact  after it has been sat in someones house  boot of car or just next to their kitchen bin  dog  cat   incontinent aunt    whatever... I think you get the Gist.   Health and safety... health and hygiene.. and consumer rights. packaging doesn t have to be opened to be tampered with and its YOUR responsibility to make sure what you sell is safe. Guess who has stopped shopping at your store? what a ridiculous policy  is that even legal?   Sheila-Anne					2016-06-02T10:32:43+0000	1464863563	2016-06-02 12:32:43	0	7	0	1	8	7	5	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I waited in all day for my tesco direct delivery only to be called  during the time slot allocated by them to tell me that they were no longer able to deliver it that day. They couldn t tell me when it would be delivered but that evening I received an email to say I should ring a number to get in touch with Arrow XL (delivery company) a number which no one appears to answer!   I will not be buying anything else from Tesco direct as believe it or not I have better things to do than run around after delivery companies and sit around waiting for goods that should have been delivered yesterday.					2016-06-02T09:07:59+0000	1464858479	2016-06-02 11:07:59	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have now been told the wishbone is bent. I believe you have a duty of care to your customers and as the cost to fix this is ¬£252 I would be grateful for a response to this. I called the hook store at 11:14 tues 30th to tell them what happened and advise them to put signs out. At the time I didn t realise my car was damaged! I have also pm d hook store but received no response. Look forward to hearing from you. Katy					2016-06-02T08:54:28+0000	1464857668	2016-06-02 10:54:28	1	6	1	0	7	6	1	5	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t want food that s left the store  been under some individuals control who may or may not either deliberately or accidentally rendered it unwholesome available for me or others to buy. Equally IF you throw it away you are adding to the huge problem of food wastage. This is in my opinion  an old conceived initiative. I won t be shopping in tescos again (and I spent ¬£100 in there yesterday!) until I m confident about food integrity.					2016-06-02T08:08:58+0000	1464854938	2016-06-02 10:08:58	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Had to take my son to do his weekly shop after 10 last night and only self serve tills were open. How the hell are you supposed to do a weekly shop like that? There was no room on the stand behind the scanner and whenever we removed something it told us it had to remain on the stand. We had a very long queue behind us as we struggled with our shopping which kept falling off the stand as there was no room. It was impossible to put our purchases through. We spend over ¬£1000 a month in Tesco s but you have now lost a family of customers for good! Ridiculous situation. Staff would not help us but just shrugged and offered no assistance! A normal till should have been opened! This was a very embarrassing situation for us as there was such a lot of people waiting behind us as we struggle for ages to put our shopping through What about families who want to do their weekly shop at night?					2016-06-02T04:43:07+0000	1464842587	2016-06-02 06:43:07	0	11	0	0	11	11	1	10	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However one of my regular purchases I was not impressed with. I was disappointed to discover that you ve changed your  Wafer Thin Honey Roast Ham  from the delicious meaty product it used to some tasteless product it is now  not to mention the fact it s gone from being square to circle slices meaning the ham does not fit perfectly with the edges of my bread üòî.   Why have you changed the product? I am not happy with it but have eaten it. I think I maybe am now forced to do my weekly shopping at Asda where they have the style of product I enjoy.

I tried to use a digtal evoucher in Tesco Rise Lane Barnstaple earlier and they said they have never seen one and tried to make out that I could only use it in stores where th facility is available. The email containing the voucher said I could use it at ant Tesco store. To say the least I  rather embarrassed to have the voucher refused. I have emailed the gift card customer services but would also be grateful for confirmation from yourselves of where digital gift cards can be used and perhaps i they can be used in store if employees had better training so they knew this.					2016-06-01T21:56:24+0000	1464818184	2016-06-01 23:56:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered my groceries yesterday  set my new address  and yet it still defaulted to an address from around 5 years ago. Delivery driver rings  to let me know he s running late (actually a really nice guy) and I explain that it looks like it s going to the wrong place anyway. He tries to fit me in  but customer service / his store manager tell him he can t bring the food to me as it s not on the invoice and they can t generate another one. So they have to take my order back to their store  and I can re-order it. Go to re-order it  and no available slots for days.   Morrison s it is then. Just to clarify  paying customer wants food  driver wants to deliver food  Tesco customer services say  Nah  we ll take the food back  put it all back on shelves  and then you can wait three days and we ll pack it all back up again.  Nonsense.					2016-06-01T20:55:37+0000	1464814537	2016-06-01 22:55:37	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ve not had any mailing about this. We save our points for Christmas vouchers  but I wanted to see if the points we had could be changed to vouchers now so we could use them in the boost.  Browsing on Tesco Direct I found a 10ft Plum trampoline for ¬£89.98 included in the boost  so on Monday 30 May I rang in the morning. It was confirmed that I would be be able to have points transferred to vouchers. But they d need to speak to my husband as the card is in his name. Called again about 7pm and  with his consent  I was told the points would be issued as a money card email that I would receive in 24 hours.  It s now Wednesday 1 June  over 48 hours later  and I ve not had any email from Tesco. And now...The trampoline we wanted has reverted to ¬£130. I ve just checked my points balance and its not changed. Indicating to me that no action has taken place to change out points to vouchers.  So my question is: As we were not informed of the final boost and because we did not receive the email in the specified time frame in order for us to use our vouchers to boost...Are you able to honour the price of the trampoline at ¬£89.98 and let us use our vouchers in the boost on it?  Because at the moment I have promised our two little girls a trampoline  and I don t want to break their hearts because I cannot afford the price hike.  Thank you.					2016-06-01T20:09:16+0000	1464811756	2016-06-01 22:09:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m a set-in-my-ways shopper who regularly buys similar products and accepts the price they are in your store. I get irrationally angry when my regular products are unavailable because they re sold out when a special deal makes them a fraction of the regular price. Not only do I miss out on the deal  I miss my regular purchase. I m not na√Øve enough to believe you lose out through the price cuts  so suspect the supplier takes a hit in the interest of the promotion but as I (and I assume I m not alone in this) intend being on the planet another half century or so  buying similar products if I like them  living in the same house  shopping in the same shops (if you still exist)  can t you simply agree a fair price to your supplier  price reasonably to give your shareholders a fair profit while not forcing your customers away  but stop silly discounting and offers so the dull  every week visitor can rely on being able to make the purchases they enjoy? Butter has brought this request about. I am unable to enjoy my usual sandwiches because you ve none of my usual brand owing to a ridiculous price cut. Are dairy farmers suddenly so wealthy they can cut their prices? Is butter so ridiculously overpriced you can slash the price so? I ll wager not. I ll be buying it whether on special offer or not but can t when it s not even on the shelf. Unfortunately for you today  I didn t purchase an alternative since I simply traveled the 2 miles to one of your competitors where it wasn t on offer but was available. So how about fair pricing for a fair product for fairly looked-after suppliers?  I know this won t affect too many share dividend payments but  I m sure you ll agree  every little helps.					2016-06-01T19:42:26+0000	1464810146	2016-06-01 21:42:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an order for a tablet and some accessories on friday night. I was quite surprised that despite offering  next day click and collect  my order would not be ready until the following wednesday - I do appreciate that it was after the 5pm cut off and a bank holiday but it wasn t even ready next working day (tuesday) and many big online retailers are still able to deliver next day click and collect on sundays and bank holidays so I was quite surprised tesco couldn t facilitate this.  Despite this I went with tesco because I believed I could rely on them to deliver my order on time.  Unfortunatly this was not the case. I received three different dispatch emails last night all stating my order would be ready to collect today. I received notification that  out of the 3 parcels had arrived but not the 3rd. I went online to track my order to find that the system coudlnt even tell me that yodel had received the parcell (Despite it being  dispatched ) and had no eta for the parcel. Confused I went into store - the staff were very helpful and rang up to chase the parcel but the response was less than satisfactory. I was told that they had to give yodel 48 hours to deliver the parcel - if this is the case why did the dispatch email sent 10pm last night still say it would arrive today?  I was also told that the reason it was dispatched by yodel is because it was coming from a different supplier. I found this particularly aggravating as I picked the tablet based on it being dispatched from tesco as I wanted to avoid the hassle that comes with buying from a third party seller - there was a much better tablet for the same price from a third party!  So here I am 5 days after placing my order with accessories and no tablet - I need to have it by tomorrow! I am awaiting a call from the store in the morning in the vague hope that it appears in the order but I don t have much faith if I am honest!					2016-06-01T18:23:41+0000	1464805421	2016-06-01 20:23:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in one of your Belfast stores today enquiring about Northern Ireland deckchairs. As I m sure you re aware  Northern Ireland has qualified for the Euros in the summer of 2016. People have managed to get these chairs but when I enquired today they didn t really know what I was after and when I did get a member of staff they said they didn t get them.  Where can I get one of these chairs? According to a few friends Tesco in Carrickfergus and Coolstown have pulled them from their shelves and they are no longer on sale. Why? I m not sure. Maybe you could contact these stores to find out why.  I would like to support my country in the Euros just like England  Wales and ROI fans.   If you could point me in the right direction or find out where to get them it would be appreciated.   Thanks.					2016-06-01T16:50:28+0000	1464799828	2016-06-01 18:50:28	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have never had a problem until now  but this is silly. I would have contacted you via email through the website  but it appears impossible to do so. This is the second order I have cancelled due to offers ending before my delivery date. Unfortunately the system does not tell you this until you have checked out. Once checked out it is impossible to cancel an order! I have emptied the basket twice and tried to do it this way  but then the update button greys out  thus  not allowing you to update the empty basket. So  two orders have now been delivered and sent away. I wonder what happened to that food when it gets back to the depo?					2016-06-01T16:03:50+0000	1464797030	2016-06-01 18:03:50	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went into your Taplow store today with the kids and they were delighted we managed to bag one of two  Little Tikes style trolleys available. Walked in out of the wind and rain to get a snap (ironically I was going to tweet you to say how much the girls enjoy  driving  around the store). Security guard comes over and tells me to stop taking photos and if I take another I ll have to be  escorted out . I asked why and where this was documented. He stated he didn t know but as it s private property they can do what they like because of terrorism.... That s where I walked away. Is there no common sense? I spent 5 secs taking a snap (obviously of my girls) on my iPhone. I wasn t entering with an SDR capturing panoramic shots of each aisle.					2016-06-01T16:00:33+0000	1464796833	2016-06-01 18:00:33	0	7	0	0	7	7	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will never buy anything without checking in the future! But I would advise you to make sure that the hygiene is up to standard as this could make someone very ill and you will loose customers.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13346924_10207411906669112_1610561117407374326_n.jpg?oh=70ccbcbc77b5f2cf7733c3ad45581282&oe=591DDD75	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13346924_10207411906669112_1610561117407374326_n.jpg?oh=0869b7d27d38674facca366ac3e79918&oe=59232301	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207411906669112&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-01T16:00:30+0000	1464796830	2016-06-01 18:00:30	4	4	4	0	8	4	4	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

On the clothing section of your website  you write  kit him out with our baby boys  collection . Now  unless you have a group of baby boys who have recently opened up a clothing collection  I think maybe it should read  baby boys collection . This however would also crreate problems by possibly inferring you are selling a collection of baby boys.   To avoid further confusion  I reccommend you scrap the collection altogether.

The first time I was super impressed btw!  Anyway I had cause to change my delivery the  morning it was due as I had to go out that afternoon last minute  i phoned your customer services line that morning and asked if it was possible to change it to click and collect so I could pick it up instead  which I was told I could and given the time of 2pm. When I got to the click and collect at the time the customer services lady had given me I was met by a lovely customer assistant called Jo nokes  unfortunately there had been some mis communication somewhere along the line and she was unable to locate my shopping at the click and collect.  Anyway she was absolutely lovely and phoned through the the main store to try and establish what had happened (I took full responsibility as I had changed it last minute anyway) not even 10 minutes later Jo came back to me and said that if I was to go to customer services in the main store then my shopping would be there ready for me to collect :-) I was already very pleased with the service I had received... But it got better When I got to customer services the lady by the desk (I m sorry I don t know her name) called through to someone and a few minutes later the manager Ben (Maga/magor?) I can t read my own writing lol came out and seeing I was heavily pregnant not only took the shopping to my car  he also helped me bag it up and unpack it from the boxes into my boot! I think that both went over and beyond what they needed to do to help me especially as it was me changing the order last minute that had caused the confusion   they could have easily sent me away to await delivery like I had originally asked for. It is important to me that they are recognised for their good work as it is very rare that people s good work is acknowledged.  Thank you very much! It was very appreciated					2016-06-01T14:46:19+0000	1464792379	2016-06-01 16:46:19	4	7	5	0	12	7	4	3	2	0	4	1	0	0	0	0	0

Having just been refurbished  wouldn t it have been advised to add more toilets to this store (which you have done upstairs but were closed to shoppers). People were queuing to use these toilets downstairs for about 10mins. Wouldn t it have been an idea to open up the ones upstairs for shoppers visiting this store. Even your staff were unimpressed by the queues. Please could you look into this issue and sort something out.					2016-06-01T13:58:22+0000	1464789502	2016-06-01 15:58:22	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wanted to use my Clubcard vouchers to boost and get some money off a trip to Folly Farm with the wee ones for next week. Problem is  I ve left it a bit late and I read that the vouchers will take 5 working days to get to my home address. We leave on Saturday. Any chance they can be emailed to me so I can print them out instead?  Any help appreciated!					2016-06-01T13:57:33+0000	1464789453	2016-06-01 15:57:33	0	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Said shopping didn t arrive  so a very hungry Andrew rang customer services to find out where it was .......  Apparently there had been some kind of mistake  which is fine  mistakes happen  so delivery was rearranged for today and he was offered a ¬£6.00 discount  which is also fine.  What has made me REALLY mad is the fact that last night he rang me asking to borrow ¬£150.00 - he s just been paid - apparently not only has he paid for his shopping but he has also somehow ended up paying for it AGAIN!  Andrew and Tamara are 21 and 20 respectively  Tam is a student and has no income  so they manage on Andrew s income. This has totally messed them up  they still have rent and living expenses to pay and they have no money left until Tesco repay their money.  Customer services have told them it will take 3 to 5 five working days for them to receive their repayment  they have been of little or no help  basically just fobbing them off with excuses and promised phone calls that don t happen and all they have offered in a measly ¬£10 total discount - the poor kids spent more than that in the Co-Op last night getting cat food and something for dinner.					2016-06-01T13:45:56+0000	1464788756	2016-06-01 15:45:56	0	21	2	2	25	21	8	13	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

By the time u get to the till your frazzled  you just want to go home and the kids just wont stop fighting and running laps up and down the tills. Then the nicest thing happens.... the cashier sees your struggling  sees your son is tired and bored and decides to distract your rioting 5 year old by getting him to  help  with the shopping. I don t know if this girl is on facebook but she amazed me with her kindness today and gave me 5 quiet mins while she calmed my son to pack my shopping but most importantly she made my son smile.

You seem to be rather difficult to get hold of so I thought I d try here.  On Monday  I received my delivery. Within my delivery  I had ordered some wraps that have been eaten - by what I can only assume to be a rodent. This is obviously rather disgusting in itself but I m also 8 months pregnant and having to be careful about what I eat. Despite the efforts of your customer care team  I have yet to speak to someone from Lee Mill - to where I keep being referred.

Ordered a pool for my niece s birthday on 11th May had to chase it up on the 25th as it hadn t been delivered. Item hadn t been dispatched so customer services re-ordered it and I was expecting delivery today. Checked the status and it s not been dispatched again! Phoned customer services who have had to re-order it again and they can t deliver it until the 10th of June. Absolutely embarrassing and an absolute shambles. Why such long delivery dates and such poor service?! So disappointing especially when you have a 5 year old desperate for her birthday present and has waited so patiently to be disappointed again!					2016-06-01T09:08:10+0000	1464772090	2016-06-01 11:08:10	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought this was a great idea as not only as a family do we get through a lot of fruit and vegetables it was encouraging those on a budget to buy and eat more healthily.   My high school son  age 14  also chooses to buy his lunch from yourselves too. He has a budget and loved it that he could afford for part of his lunch a punnet of the imperfect fruit along with a pasta bowl. He prefers this to buying a meal deal including fruit as the packet there is smaller and he is a hungry growing boy  and on a budget.   After speaking to a member of the greencrocer staff i was not sure if anymore imperfect fruit would be coming in; and although fruit is sometimes discounted it is not until 2pm across the company as a whole. I feel maybe to help promote healthy eating particularly to those on a low budget and to those children/consumer wishing to choose a healthy filling option maybe more imperfect fruit and vegetables and the timings of reduced fruit and vegetables could be reviewed inline with lunchtimes? This would allow a healthier choice to be considered  purchased and consumed  particularly in our future generation.  Look forward to your feedback.  Kind regards					2016-06-01T08:31:57+0000	1464769917	2016-06-01 10:31:57	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In my area  the Tesco Hardengreen store has been a great support to local food banks. The recent story about your Leith store needing to attach security devices to in continence pants made me wonder: would these be items stolen by career criminals or is it perhaps that some of the poorest in society are just desperately seeking some dignity? I of course can not claim to know the answer for sure  but wonder if it might be possible for you (or Tena) to use some of your corporate social responsibility budget to donate some of these pants to local health clinics  food banks or other relevant community groups? Or even to encourage customers to donate such items for food banks (I for one would be happy to donate to such a drive)? I know there have been similar collections of nappies etc. I may be wrong and only your experts will see the difference  but it may significantly reduce the need to buy the expensive security tags to protect future stocks? There will be someone better qualified than I to advise  but just thought I would put the suggestion out there.					2016-06-01T08:16:16+0000	1464768976	2016-06-01 10:16:16	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is absolutely awful and needs to be investigated straight away. Fortunately she came away with just a small cut in her mouth but it is a huge concern that glass can get in with the fruit???

Summer jackets (showerproof too) and dressy strappy sandals.  Otherwise well done.					2016-06-01T07:07:53+0000	1464764873	2016-06-01 09:07:53	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Happens to be a regular thing every week with this store!!! Sort it out for crying out loud. The staff here clearly don t like customers	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13335726_10154220496009907_7852325401766592662_n.jpg?oh=1cd9fb7251e593431fcd3d22af9ac00b&oe=591E9E9D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13335726_10154220496009907_7852325401766592662_n.jpg?oh=23e5a5fb66619ae1f665477f13070e4a&oe=58EB0E90	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154220496009907&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-06-01T01:58:02+0000	1464746282	2016-06-01 03:58:02	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Almost double the price but less than half the quality. First 3 packs we brought were rotten. Other half took them back and was given 3 more. Yep you guessed it rotten. Well one punnet isn t most of them aren t even ripe outside of the few that are starting to turn and a bug in the bottom.  The smaller punnets at 75p were perfect and tasted better than your ¬£2 punnets.  So now we have to make yet another trip to tesco to replace them again. The customer service desk didn t seem bothered in the slightest and didn t even offer a refund.					2016-06-01T00:04:14+0000	1464739454	2016-06-01 02:04:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
