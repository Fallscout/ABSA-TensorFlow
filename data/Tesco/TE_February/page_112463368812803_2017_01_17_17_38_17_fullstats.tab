However today I went to the Ipswich store near Toys R Us and found the toilets to be dirty and smelly  and the cafe to be a disappointment with staff who didn t seem to want to be there. Tesco s maybe I ve been spoilt by the Hythe store  but really I do expect a certain standard of customer care and cleanliness.  One very disappointed customer.					2016-02-29T22:37:16+0000	1456785436	2016-02-29 23:37:16	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve got enough here to open a Thai restaurant for the week. I thought I was going mad (once I ordered 48 packets of hula hoops in a sleep deprived moment)  but this has happened three times now. I order the least amount I can - 19p worth and 84p worth arrives. Turns out 84p gets you a lot of ginger  I don t like waste so I now have three huge chunks of ginger languishing in my freezer. I ve checked my order  I definitely ordered 19 pence  where am I going wrong?!?					2016-02-29T20:48:40+0000	1456778920	2016-02-29 21:48:40	2	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	10	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tonight apparently. The Billericay store shut between 8pm and 8.20pm for staff breaks. I completely understand that staff are entitled to breaks but if there are not enough staff on duty to make it safe for them to take their breaks then the store should not be open at all. Sainsburys will be opening a store soon in Billericay and Tesco should be very concerned. All of us potential customers went to Waitrose this evening and they were happy to take our money. #DisappointedAtLackOfService					2016-02-29T20:44:12+0000	1456778652	2016-02-29 21:44:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have seen it out once in the main Banbury store (on the retail park). As I have not seen the stand since  last week  I asked customer services in store. They dragged someone over from  fruit and veg  who informed me that it is  only at weekends  but if I ask during the week I will be given some yummy natural goodness for my daughter .  So today  a Monday  I went in and asked if my daughter could have a banana. The lovely lady I asked went off to ask someone. She returned to tell me that the manager has said  we don t do it during the week  but we could have a piece of fruit . The result  my daughter had a banana instead of demanding chocolate cookies. Excellent...  But...I am left not knowing if the store is running the system or not!? A lot of parents shop during the week  when it is a little quieter so when our children melt-down and lay on their backs having a tantrum...we are not disturbing too many other shoppers! Can I get a definitive answer please?					2016-02-29T18:25:06+0000	1456770306	2016-02-29 19:25:06	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I rang up the Stockport Tesco Extra to ask if they sold halal meat meat  was put on hold with customer services while they checked... I was advised that yes they do... So we came over especially but when we got there we were told no they don t  they don t stock it in that store.

I only nipped in to return 2 items  all very straightforward. The queue at customer services was long enough when I joined ( 5 people in front of me )  but was made worse by only one member of staff serving  who had to keep leaving the desk to check things. The customers were all clearly fed up waiting  and when the queue reached 8 long I d had enough and decided to find a manager to try and get another person to serve. I did find a man who said  I ll put a call out   but I wasn t hopeful. Another staff member came behind the desk to do something with DVDs  but at no point acknowledged ANY of us waiting  said they d get help or anything. By the time I did get served  the interaction from your staff member was non existent. No greeting  no smile  no apology for the wait  I had to remind him to scan the second item  no confirmation of amount being refunded  then told to  put your card in   then passed my receipts  no thank you or goodbye. Absolutely dreadful from start to finish. I ve posted on here as I have no faith that I would get any response from the store					2016-02-29T16:31:36+0000	1456763496	2016-02-29 17:31:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I left and forgot about it. The next day I went to another tescos to see if I could get a voucher and they said no I should go back to the algate one and that they would give me the voucher. So then I went back to the algate one today and the manager said he couldn t do anything about it and that it should have printed out before the receipt - well obviously it didn t print out as I had the receipt for my sale but not for the voucher. Why should i have to lose 5£ because the tescos machine was faulty? And receive contradicting advice from two tescos branches?					2016-02-29T16:05:12+0000	1456761912	2016-02-29 17:05:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I really don t expect to get shafted at the till for another poor quality carrier bag once one has split.  It seems a paltry amount to lose when you consider the £1000 s I have spent with you through the years.  However I ll not accept being so brazenly robbed in front of a store full of other probable ex-customers.  I did challenge the woman on the till over slipping on the extra charge for the bag that had split right in front of her  but she was adamant.  Unfortunately owing to her poor judgment and your loss of my goodwill I currently intend to do my incidental and weekly grocery shopping with anyone except Tesco.   Every little counts!  P.S  I m happy to post the till receipts from all future transactions that would ve been your s.					2016-02-29T15:54:54+0000	1456761294	2016-02-29 16:54:54	1	9	1	0	10	8	3	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had my little boy with me who was on his bike that I push along. He attempted to stand up in his bike and it fell over resulting in my son getting a nasty cut and bruise on his forehead. The staff in the store were so helpful and they came to my sons aid very quickly with a packet of sweets which immediately calmed him down. One member of staff also helped me with the rest of my shopping and she assisted me by pushing my sons bike whist I carried him. I was in such a panic I didn t even ask the member of staffs name. But her merchant number I have on my receipt. I just thought it was a lovely gesture to be so helpful and I think the staff are excellent. Thank you Tesco  Caterham.					2016-02-29T15:18:06+0000	1456759086	2016-02-29 16:18:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to make a compliment rather than a complaint  I have been reading so many posts about things that are are blatantly out of your hands about your products (if even your products)  as there s so many brand named items that you have not made and packaged etc so complaints should be going to manufacturers not to you!!! Mistakes are made unfortunately were all human and we ll continue to do so as long as things are dealt with I don t see a problem. Too many people are complaining over silly things.   I would like to say I have been shopping with you for a long time  for the past year and a half I have been having home deliveries every week due to 3 small children it s very handy and convenient for me. I have only had a few complaints in that time either shopping missing or damaged goods I ve always phoned customer service about it  they ve always been great and helpful problem has been solved nice and quick. I must say some foods are expensive but hey that s life you ll always find that in shops nothing you can do. However certain items I would definitely recommend to others your tesco 24 meatballs they are bloody delicious along with your tesco meatball sauce big hit with this family. I m fussy with cheap sauces some are far too runny or bland but your tesco everyday value or tesco own  curry  Indian sauces  meatballs or lasagne sauces are bloody lovely!!!!! Your tesco loves baby range are great quality and do not leak at all I ve been buying them since my twin girls were born (2 years old next month) as you can imagine that s alot of nappies and wet wipes I go through and they are always a great price as well as quality. I have never had problems with quality I must be very lucky but I m would like to say keep up the good work!!!! Prices  quality  delivery staff  customer service  people that work in the stores everyone your doing great which is why I always come back every week  the freshness of fruit and vegetables are always at a great standard only place to get it all as fresh as yours!!!!!

If you want to look through the clothes for your size and happen to mess up the display slightly or not put the item back on its hanger or back in size order then you ve had it. She comes along moaning whinging complaining at the top of her voice at how it was tidy a minute ago. Doing it all in a snide manner so that you hear her and are left in no doubt that she knows it was you.  Maybe if the jeans had been hung up properly I wouldn t have needed to take them off the hanger to see the size. And along she comes while I was still standing there creating hell cos someone had made a tiny mess.  So I decided enough was enough.  Paid for my items and got a manager. Really hoping a Very Strong word is had in her ear. If she doesn t want to tidy up the clothes after customers have looked at them I suggest a role in the warehouse would suit her better.  Rude Obnoxious Nasty and Vile woman.  She is something else. Shame she doesn t work somewhere else!!!!!!					2016-02-29T15:08:34+0000	1456758514	2016-02-29 16:08:34	1	12	1	0	13	12	1	11	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apples are one of the worst pesticide ridden fruits in the U.K. and my husband is a huge fan of green (not red) apples.  Just a suggestion that there are people that would love more organic choices.  Hope you guy s will consider in future :)					2016-02-29T14:31:02+0000	1456756262	2016-02-29 15:31:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 6 year old son loves looking at the fresh fish on the counter. Today a lady called Rowena was serving the fish and I said my son and I were just looking today. She was lovely! She came to our side of the counter and picked some of the fish up and talked to my done about them. She showed him their fins explained where they were from and gave him a glove so he could hold a mackerel with her. She showed him both sides of a plaice fillet  top side and underside. She was just lovely and really made his day!! I hope this will get back to her. Thanks Rowena! 😊					2016-02-29T13:32:26+0000	1456752746	2016-02-29 14:32:26	12	9	12	0	21	9	8	1	2	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0

Eggs from caged hens are clearly labelled as such  so that shoppers can make an informed decision on what they wish to buy.   Your answer is a complete contradiction  you say you are committed to high animal welfare  but then shirk responsibility for funding caged hen eggs by stating they are clearly labelled for the consumer to decide.  You either need to stop purchasing them to validate your claim of high animal welfare standards  or you need to stand behind your commercial decision to sell these eggs  which are lower in cost due to the inherently cruel conditions for the hens that produce them.   Labelling the eggs clearly and hiding behind a  red tractor label  doesn t absolve you from the basic fact that you as an organisation directly fund animal cruelty.  Stop being so cowardly and publicly stand behind your ethically poor decisions!					2016-02-29T12:22:27+0000	1456748547	2016-02-29 13:22:27	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have had no follow up on this and am disgusted that anyone could throw a  cream cake box whilst driving  especially whilst representing your company.  Littering is illegal  it goes against your corporate policies and is totally unacceptable on a personal and on an environmental level.  Maybe I should have called the police but I didn t  I picked up your drivers rubbish  I reported it to you wanted to be contacted regarding what was going to be done about it.

I encourage Tesco to not stick to the copy and paste PR response  the eggs we sell meet and exceed industry standards  and  if you don t want caged hen eggs  don t buy them  they re labeled  Sure  that s great  boxes are ticked on a piece of paper stating industry standards that were decided by someone who doesn t have to live in the conditions that caged hens do and it s our fault for buying the eggs!  Wether you don t know  or choose to ignore knowledge of the conditions that caged hens have to  live  in - I urge you to take a look. Just because it s not plastered in everyone s face everyday doesn t mean it s not real. Surely you agree you wouldn t want to be in that situation? People buy those eggs that s why you stock them - sure but Tesco is just as responsible as an enabler  Tesco  what s the right thing to do?

Their one single failing is that they can continue to lay even when they are treated inhumanely. Caging hens is simply torture. They cannot express their normal behaviours - scratching for bugs  dust bathing  stretching their wings etc in cages and overcrowding induces unbelievable stress and bullying. It is not necessary to torture animals for our food.  STOP SELLING EGGS FROM CAGED HENS.					2016-02-29T05:53:14+0000	1456725194	2016-02-29 06:53:14	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Is this normal procedure?					2016-02-28T20:51:44+0000	1456692704	2016-02-28 21:51:44	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I visited my local Tesco today approximately 10 minutes until closing I have to say I was both appalled and outraged as to what I witnessed. 3 and counting pink refuse sized bags with the words not suitable for human consumption written on them  being filled with loaves of bread straight off the shelves. What an absolute waste of food. Whilst it may have been close dated that bread could very well have been donated to homeless shelters or food banks. It certainly would have done more use in their hands rather than being thrown away. It is because of big supermarkets that we have developed this throw away society. Countless tons of food wasted. Whilst I am but one customer and may not seem big in the eyes of the giant (although  every little helps ) I from today withdraw my future custom from Tesco until something is done about the reduction of food wasted.					2016-02-28T19:38:49+0000	1456688329	2016-02-28 20:38:49	6	10	6	0	16	10	10	0	19	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am really tired of your weird rules about national ID cards . I have polish ID which is acceptable everywhere  I can even go abroad on that document and its only you that does not accept it.  I dont have irish citizenship so I cant show you any irish document except my student card or medical card.   I think this is discrimination at some point for all foreign people living here. You are losing customers which is not a good way to keep the business in the right position.					2016-02-28T18:12:25+0000	1456683145	2016-02-28 19:12:25	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Without say anything to me the checkout lady called over a runner/supervisor   and said she can only buy 2 tin of milk can t she (all 3 tins had been rung through and the rest of my shopping to by now). The runner /supervisor said yes that s right it s the law  to which I ask which law to which he said he would need to get a manager. Another 10 minutes passed and he returned to say oh you can now buy more than 3. I find it hard to believe that you would limit the purchases of baby milk yet I could buy limitless sports drinks or even alcohol. Even other shoppers could not believe this situation. Although resolved  I am disappointed that stuff were going to limit purchase of a product and not know why ?? If this was a law or just a Tesco thing					2016-02-28T13:06:29+0000	1456664789	2016-02-28 14:06:29	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Most kitchen units are standard size  my wall cupboards have 2 shelves which are 9  / 22cm apart so no way a cereal box will it standing up on them! Perhaps Tesco would redesign cereal boxes to fit our kitchen cupboards. Short wider boxes instead of tall narrower ones would be ideal.					2016-02-28T12:54:03+0000	1456664043	2016-02-28 13:54:03	3	5	3	0	8	4	2	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

My local store told me you have done away with the Free From White Chocolate buttons and Tesco Free From Seeded loaf. She said sometimes we have to refresh stocks/lines so things have to go. What even if they sell? No wonder Tesco keeps closing stores then!  I have noticed you mess around with the Free From range quite abit. it s not on  I mean you don t feel the need to mess about with your Baked Beans section do you? So why pick on foods that are free from? We hardly have enough foods as it is  so to have you keep deciding what we eat is just atrocious. Give people like me a range of foods...and blooming KEEP THEM!!  Add to them  don t give in one hand and take away in another. You idiots!!  If it ain t broke  don t fix it! Der!!  You have just lost a customer. Back to Asda for me!					2016-02-28T10:56:18+0000	1456656978	2016-02-28 11:56:18	1	6	1	0	7	6	1	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I took my daughter into Tesco  for a tissue! A lovely lady called Letitia (think that s how u spell it) came over with some baby wipes n held them to my daughter mouth to try stop the bleeding & also clean her up! She also cleaned all the blood from me as I was trying to cuddle my daughter! It may seem like nothing to some ppl but it meant a lot to me that she actually took time to help my daughter but also help me so I could keep my daughter in my arms to cuddle her! She also let my daughter go pick a lollipop to make her feel better! Ppl like these are rare n I just wanted to tell u that she is a credit to Tesco!

When taking my car to the garage on the last break down I had to have a new fuel filter costing £120. The garage asked where I filled  up & I was annoyed to be told that tesco leave out an additive from their diesel & that during the cold weather the lack of this additive causes crystals to form in the filter which is what had happened to me. I will no longer be filling up at tesco & will make sure my friends don t suffer the same consequences as me. Why is this so??? An expensive shopping trip for me so back to sainsburys I think.					2016-02-27T22:07:35+0000	1456610855	2016-02-27 23:07:35	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was sat in one of the baby trolleys and a suddenly started screaming. I found his finger was trapped and obviously causing him pain. The member of staff behind the deli counter chose to ignore what had happened even though he was obviously in distress. Luckily a lady customer came and helped me calm him down and checked his finger which was a deep red and now has bruising coming up under his nail. It s really bad that equipment specifically provided for young children and babies isn t safe for their use.					2016-02-27T21:32:35+0000	1456608755	2016-02-27 22:32:35	0	2	0	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Called just to be told there was issue with my card (unsure why as used it previously). What does annoys me though is being told I was called twice today but I did not answer?! Well let me tell you I did not have ANY missed call  NO voicemail!! This is not the first time my order got messed up  didn t order for some time as last order came 4+hours late. Your customer service is appealing indeed!! Seriously don t know why I still bother...

Off I went to the customer service desk  spoke to an employee who pointed me back to the electrical desk  back I go to the other end of the store again.   Upon arrival at the electrical desk wait for a staff member  they then cannot find the keys to enter the store room.   Eventually the keys are found  and guess what?  You don t even have the game in stock...   I m now really cheesed off   I politely thank the staff member and walk away biting my lip and keeping a civil tongue in my mouth.   It s not hard - if you don t have stock of something remove the display cases or put an OUT OF STOCK label on the shelf location.   I dare say I won t even get a reply let alone any satisfaction out of this   thanks Tesco for wasting my time.					2016-02-27T20:51:29+0000	1456606289	2016-02-27 21:51:29	1	4	1	0	5	3	2	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I handed my keys to one of the guys   done my shopping had a coffee  came back out and found a nice dent and scrape on my car (I can prove by CCTV of my route to tesco)  which was not there before I handed my keys over. Tesco s or the car wash conveniently have no CCTV footage that cover the car where I was TOLD to park it!! We had no phone call from staff after they promised us they will once CCTV had been watched  only to be told (by the very security guard that we had spoke to earlier in the day)after having to make another trip due to the store not phoning as promised  that the camera we were told was on a timed rotation where our car was parked now no longer does rotations so no proof of who damaged the car. The car wash refuse to give us there insurance details because they have to pay a £500 excess & we cannot prove it was one of there staff members that damaged the car  although evidence so far points mode there way  an(as far as we re concerned they had the keys and we parked it where we were told to  as they was using this part as there overflow  and so damage caused is there responsibility  our insurance company also say this should be the case). The police are now involved who are treating this as criminal damage. We were tesco fans and fans of the carwash who actually do a really good job  and I always have them £5 tip. We shall no longer use tesco or the car wash. Should be ashamed to treat your customers this way. There is a reason why tesco is making losses and poor customer satisfaction is a big one.					2016-02-27T18:11:41+0000	1456596701	2016-02-27 19:11:41	7	23	8	10	41	23	11	12	6	0	7	0	0	0	0	1	0

However  why are the only three choices available in your Boston  Lincs store for causes in Kings Lynn and Norfolk which is 40 miles away and in a different county.

I knew the lady at the counter and she joked with me about being too old to play football. Upon hearing our conversation  the pharmacist told me to try some weaker pain killers like standard paracetamol first  to which I replied that those were not strong enough as the lady was correct. The pharmacist then took it upon himself to inform me that he will be refusing to sell me painkillers in the future  and will be referring me instead to my Doctor. I explained to him that I can follow the instructions on the label  and only use the tablets after football. However  although he remained polite  he insisted that my Doctor would have to be informed. This was bloody annoying Tesco  not to mention ridiculous. I got what could only be described as a public lecture. The simple concept of a 45 year old taking painkillers after playing football was lost on him  and it was for some reason assumed that I was not capable of following the instructions on a label. Despite my insistence that I was not a child  and could be trusted to use the pills as specified  the pharmacist remained adamant that my Doctor should be notified. This was not necessary  inappropriate  and not to mention embarrassing. Where do you get these guys?					2016-02-27T16:59:07+0000	1456592347	2016-02-27 17:59:07	0	6	0	0	6	6	5	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s extremely rare that anything is substituted but mostly I would like to thank the two young men that mostly work on there.

He could see me struggling with a large item that I had collected while trying to get my toddler to the car so he kindly asked me if I needed help and carried by box to the car so I could pick my little girl up. Didn t even give me chance to get a little stressed! It s the small things... Thank you 👌👏					2016-02-27T15:39:19+0000	1456587559	2016-02-27 16:39:19	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The hens are kept in cruel  inhumane conditions  as I m sure you know. All for the sake of profit.

Disabled parking.  My husband is disabled and always backs into a parking space as it is safer to see to get out. Today he parked in the last space nearest the store. When we came out of the store someone had parked on the end which is not a parking space making it difficult for him to get into the drivers door. I spoke to them at customer services and was told all they could do was ask them to move their car. Would it not be better to have bollards placed to stop people parking there leaving enough room for the legally parked driver to get in and out of their car?  2. Five pence tokens for local charities. I was given a token which I could place in a choice of three charity boxes. One in Redruth  one in St Ives  and one in Penzance. While I am sure that they are all very deserving charities all these charities have a local Tesco store of their own. I was wondering why we haven t got a box for a charity that is local to our own Helston store as I don t consider Redruth  St Ives  and Penzance to be local to me? I am sure there are a lot of your other customers at the Helston store who feel the same as myself.					2016-02-27T13:22:57+0000	1456579377	2016-02-27 14:22:57	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought about 200-250g organic whole almonds once in your store  costing £2.80 (just to identify which one it was  in case). I did with them what I do with almonds from other sellers: soak them for about 24 hours to swell  so called to activate them. They gain volume and are more tasty  individually as a snack. With no other almonds I have experienced so far what I have experienced with yours: Quite a few of them were so very bitter and tasted of  almonds   suggesting a high content of cyanide or similar compounds  that it made the tip of my tongue tingling and they were inedible. I had to spit them out. I think this deserves an investigation who is supplying you with the almonds and where they are sourced. I do not believe that them being organic should allow for such bitter seeds. Should I have put them into some food together  that could have ruined it whole.					2016-02-27T13:18:35+0000	1456579115	2016-02-27 14:18:35	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went into the store and asked for help from the first employee I found. All I know is his name was Dan...and he was absolutely brilliant. He let me borrow a set of jump leads and brought his own car over to mine in an attempt to get me going. When this failed he took me to customer services to see if there was any help they could offer in the way of a vehicle recovery service. When this wasn t possible he offered my a complimentary coffee in the cafe. I just wanted Tesco to know what a fantastic  helpful employee Dan is. I wish I d asked his surname but I hope you can track him down with just his first name..!!

I think this is a brilliant idea ... I always forget carrier bags!  However the three charities to chose from are 15 miles away in a different local authority area in more affluent Cwmbran. Blaenau Gwent where the Abertillery store is situated is a very deprived area  and it is embarrassing and insulting to ask customers to contribute to a more affluent area  Please could you choose local charities or move the box.  I can suggest 3 local charities ... and there are many more  Blaina 275 squadron air cadets  Hospice of the valleys  Salvation army  All doing very good work in our lovely home town and surrounding area.

Large Tesco order was due to be delivered late afternoon yesterday. She received a message to say the delivery would be delayed. The delivery failed to turn up within the new time slot.  A further message to then say due to a Van breakdown that the shopping would not be delivered.  Leaving a family without their weekly shop. Add to this the extra expense of buying take out food for dinner due to the original delay.  She is now in the position of awaiting the refunded money to go back in to her bank account. A process that Tesco say is out with their hands and cannot confirm when this money will be refunded in to her bank account. My friend has explained to Tesco customer services that she does not have the funds to re-order shopping until a refund is in her account!  Tesco response   sorry   a van breakdown is out with our control and the offer of a £20 evoucher which Tesco now claim will allow my friend to order a  few  things to feed her children with until she can afford to re-order.  I would be very interested to know if the original delay was due to a van break down and why my friend was not made aware of this at the time. My friend is distraught and currently at home with 4 children one of which is her youngest baby who is currently still attached to an oxygen tank due to being born very early. All of this has been explained to Tesco customer service team to no avail.  I am looking for this issue to be rectified immediately and would expect better from a large company such as Tesco which surely relies on customer satisfaction to retain business. I m very sure that Tesco failures should not be the cause of any family being left in food poverty and the possibility of needing to contact social services with further assistance possibly being needed from a local Fordbank.  I will await a response from Tesco before I make contact with local media to further highlight this failure and subsequent lack of concern re- remedying this issue.					2016-02-27T12:08:45+0000	1456574925	2016-02-27 13:08:45	1	8	1	0	9	8	6	2	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After searching through all of your lovely  Mum  cards I found the perfect one.. great.. then it was time to find an equally perfect card for my Gran  who all my life has been a second Mum to me. Amazing lady. I m sure you can understand my disappointment and annoyance to find not a single  Gran  card. Not even one. However  to all the folk who call their Gran:  -Grandma  -Grandmother  -Nan -Nana  -Nanny   You are in luck.   After posting this on my Facebook  a lot of my friends agree that this also annoys them & that Tesco have been missing  Gran  cards for years. Is it a Scottish thing to call your gran   Gran?

Not resolved giving me my money back after taking it out of my account on the 23rd of Feb. Still not had this issue resolved after having 4 different customer service colleagues involved. Not one person has an idea of what is happening or even suggested compensating time and money lost. I will not be using these services again.					2016-02-27T10:22:29+0000	1456568549	2016-02-27 11:22:29	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We stood and waited when i asked the checkout  supervisor  if anymore tills could be opened she completely  ignored  me walking away. After 5 mins i put my items on the belt to see the supervisor  standing watching my every  movement whilst talking  to another  member  of staff. Probably  moaning cause  i had asked about another till to be opened.  This  which made me feel very uncomfortable When it came to myself being serviced the cashier never said hello.need help.need bags just scanned my items.  I moved along so my husband could  pay He had a voucher she was looking all round  and started talking to the customer behind us ! eventually  she took the voucher and  my husband paid. She didn t  give him the receipt  and started to scan  the next shop.. So he took it himself.  I have called the store to be promised a call back. But no surprise  no call.   Wont use Tesco Hatfield  again					2016-02-27T09:01:31+0000	1456563691	2016-02-27 10:01:31	3	8	3	0	11	7	2	5	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Waiting up until 1am and shopping never arrived  no text message or phone call as to why. Also very helpful that Tesco s customer service helpline shuts at 11:00pm!  Phoned customer service this morning and they could not get hold of the store the order was coming from and offered me re-delivery on Sunday. Not good enough so I have cancelled my order.

Which I m being told I m now no longer receiving due to a van break down! I can honestly say I m very very disappointed!  I have 4 children  my youngest baby is on oxygen and it isn t easy for me to leave the house at the drop of a hat. I have to properly plan and prepare so we don t get out much and shopping isn t easy due to having a baby in a car seat and an oxygen tank to carry which is why I get it delivered! (Also my car is off the road) I had plans for tonight after my shopping was delivered. I had to cancel everything. I had to spend extra money on a take away as my order was to be late  and now it s cancelled completely.  Iits now 21:30 on a Friday night and I have no shopping in thanks to use cancelling my delivery.  A £10 voucher and an offer to redeliver my order for free just doesn t cut it! I m very disappointed and will be taking my business elsewhere!					2016-02-26T21:31:10+0000	1456522270	2016-02-26 22:31:10	6	25	6	1	32	25	5	20	9	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Should you cut and paste your corporate response here then that will not surprise me either. However  if you actually stop selling these eggs - given the inhumanity even of the idea never mind the practice - then that would surprise me. Even when so many people - many of them your own customers - are telling you they want you to stop  you seem not to have heard. I think this will continue until I am surprised.					2016-02-26T18:42:38+0000	1456512158	2016-02-26 19:42:38	3	0	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just picked up some suitcases that I ordered online to click and collect. My friend has just bought the same ones in store for a fraction of the price. However those were the last ones in store and the store won t allow me to get a refund of the difference. This seems really unfair. How can I be charged £130 and someone else £7 for the same thing?

Your market share is dropping like a stone. Once upon a time  Tesco had standards   I know that because my Uncle was the manager of one of your very early stores. His edict was the that customers came first because without them the company would cease to exist.  Maybe it s time to revist those long forgotten ideals and bring the company into the 21st century.

Firstly  I was ID d for a 15 rated film  which wouldn t have been that offensive had it not been for the rudeness for the way in which the staff member asked me. No eye contact  no please  just  ID?.  Now I work in the service industry and appreciate the need to check ages for certain age restricted items  however this should be handled with sensitivity and care and not belittle the customer.   Secondly  after buying 3 DVD s I left the store and got home to find that 2 out of 3 had not had the tags removed. A simple mistake but an annoying one costing me time that didn t need to be used to return to the store and wait in a large queue to have the tags removed. After waiting 10 minutes in the queue I was greeted by yet another unfriendly face with no smile. I told her that  I was unhappy about having to return for such a simple mistake  and none the less the case had been damaged on one of them and I would like to change it.  The monotone reply was to  go and get myself one then  which I did. On return to the customer services desk another customer was being served  again I appreciate it was busy  however I then had to wait  whilst another customer was clearly distressed and thought I had pushed in. I handed over the DVD for the tag to be removed  the DVD was practically snatched from my hands  again no eye contact  and then thrust back to me with my receipt. There was no attempt at the faintest of apologies for the inconvenience caused  nor a smile just  there you go.  Extremely unhappy at the way I was treated on bother occasions by staff and think that the customer service desk needs to be trained on how to turn a customer complaint around; not a good example being set. I hope to see in the future that this is rectified and the check out staff to be more aware in the first place so this doesn t happen. I m not sure Tesco is a place I will return to if this is the way the staff feel is acceptable to treat their customers when they make mistakes.					2016-02-26T18:18:59+0000	1456510739	2016-02-26 19:18:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Here are 3 examples: 1) Tesco contiue to sell battery produced eggs and are therefor are supporting incredible cruelty. Customers who are concerned about price could use fewer eggs rather than cruelly produced ones. 2) Today I spent a lot of time looking at the ingredients of dairy spreads and biscuits so I could avoid supporting the production of non-sustainable palm oil. Such palm oil is leading to the near extinction of orangutans in Indonesia  devasting local life styles and adding seriously tothe problem of global warming through the burning of forest and peat. I am shocked at how hard it is to avoid products containing palm oil. 3) Whilst you do sell Fair Trade ground coffee  what has happened to Fair Trade instant coffee? Foar Trade fortnight in March would be a good time to reinstae that. I will save my concerns at your selling a multitude of water softening products in Halifax  a soft water area  until another time!					2016-02-26T17:21:01+0000	1456507261	2016-02-26 18:21:01	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I see that they are copying and pasting the stock answer that they conform to standards of animal welfare! Rubbish! DoTesco or any other supermarket think it is fine to subject hens to a short miserable life confined in a tiny space with no daylight/access to the outside/unable to exhibit natural behaviours and often beaks cut? Do they consider that to come under the  animal welfare  standards? Here is a challenge Tescos!  Go above and beyond basic animal welfare standards... DO THE RIGHT THING & ONLY SELL FREE RANGE EGGS.					2016-02-26T16:18:49+0000	1456503529	2016-02-26 17:18:49	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

If people are unable to walk they should have a disabled badge and use the disabled bays. As the mother of a 12 week old baby  if I have to use a standard space I have to get the car seat out of the car (if I even can - the standard spaces aren t wide enough for car seat removal) and get my baby into or out of his pram in the middle of the car park with cars whizzing up and down and frankly  it s dangerous.					2016-02-26T14:41:06+0000	1456497666	2016-02-26 15:41:06	1	27	1	0	28	26	6	20	10	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Selling only eggs from truly free range hens will send a message that these concerns are important to you and your company ethos.

When I saw you had decided to return to selling cage eggs I was disgusted. I onIy buy organic free range eggs even though I know the conditions in which these hens are kept is far from ideal. You no doubt will say your consumers like the cheaper price of eggs from cage and barn hens and don t care about the conditions in which they are kept. Well why not educate them? Lead the way and do something good. Show photos of the conditions these poor creatures are kept in and tell them why you are not selling these eggs any more. If people can t afford to spend ten pence more per egg then let them stop drinking and smoking so much and or buying so many take always or buying processed rubbish. I honestly think that most decent people whose eyes could be opened to the conditions in which farmed animals are kept  would be happy to pay a little more. No  I am not a vegetarian but I happen to have a conscience and although I am living on a state pension I dont want to contribute to such disgusting cruelty so I eat less animal products.					2016-02-26T13:55:45+0000	1456494945	2016-02-26 14:55:45	2	12	3	0	15	12	3	9	2	0	2	0	0	0	1	0	0

I am writing to support the current campaign to persuade Tesco buyers to stop the sale of eggs from barn or cage birds.  Just stop!  Sainsbury did.  M&S did.  So just do the right thing and Stop!!!!  They are born into a life of misery and the human being is their only recourse to justice.  You  will see from my purchase record that we always buy  free range  eggs and where possible  British  produce to support our farmers.  I and many others rely on Tesco to do the right thing and at 70 I refuse to let apathy stop me from facing this head on.

I always thought that Tesco s tried to do the right thing regarding animal issues. Having read how these poor chickens are kept and the miserable lives they lead  I have now changed my mind. It s not good enough to say that you are giving the consumer an informed choice  you should lead by example and show people that you genuinely care about animals. After all these are living feeling creatures that should be cared for not exploited for profit. I expect better behaviour from big retailers.					2016-02-26T13:38:04+0000	1456493884	2016-02-26 14:38:04	4	2	4	0	6	2	2	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Caged and barn hens are only kept because companies like Tesco continue to sell this type of egg. The hen suffers as a consequence in so far as it does not have the same welfare standards as a free range hen.

The hens that provide these eggs are treated in a way that no living creature should have to endure and your refusing to buy them would go a long way to encouraging suppliers to turn to more ethical farming with higher welfare standards for the animals. Customers tend to make their decisions based upon price and probably don t notice the origins of the product or understand entirely what the terms mean. It would be more adult of Tesco to take the responsibility away form the customer and just not offer these intensely farmed eggs - what do thou think Tesco - good idea?					2016-02-26T13:18:35+0000	1456492715	2016-02-26 14:18:35	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Do not send your standard reply the two sentences contradict each other  I post a copy of your answer to others to remind you what you said.   Chickens are NOT happy being caged and so if your first para is correct you would not need to state the second.  Your reply previously:-    We are committed to high animal welfare standards and all of our egg producers must be fully compliant with the Red Tractor assurance scheme  as well as meet additional Tesco welfare standards.   Eggs from caged hens are clearly labelled as such  so that shoppers can make an informed decision on what they wish to buy.					2016-02-26T12:40:36+0000	1456490436	2016-02-26 13:40:36	4	0	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please go for it and you will have loyalty and growth in your customer base!					2016-02-26T12:16:40+0000	1456489000	2016-02-26 13:16:40	5	2	5	0	7	2	1	1	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is so cruel to the hens.  I haven t bought them for over 20 years since I learned how awful the lives of the hens are.  Get rid of these eggs .  It will improve your reputation.

I recently bought a punnet of blueberries from one of your stores  to today find a spiders nest in one of them while washing them to give to my 22 month old son.  My immediate reaction was to get the remainder of the fruit out of my home and throw it in the bin. However when I contacted someone from your customer service team I was told to take the nest and packaging to a store.  However because I had thrown it away there wasn t much more that could be done.  I gave the customer service agent all the information from the packaging and she said she would let the supplier know of this issue.   I sincerely hope that letting the supplier know will help in preventing this issue from happening in the future.  I am now afraid to give my children fruit that has been imported from another country because of this. I hope that bring this to your attention will prevent other customers having the experience I have had.  My skin still crawls just thinking about it.					2016-02-26T10:03:06+0000	1456480986	2016-02-26 11:03:06	2	3	2	1	6	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

But I must say the past 2 or 3 experiences have caused me to doubt it can really be a big player in the retail sector in this day and age. customer service has plummeted to an all time low. Firstly my wife is of limited ability at walking and we have noted that in recent years the mobility scooters went down hill and at one point there was barely ever one available so we changed where we shopped  Your loss part 1  secondly I had trouble at customer svc s when taking back underwear that was on a size 14 hanger but was a size 8  and then this morning  after being given a present of a rice cooker and having trouble with it  ie the base of metal protecting the element inside melting and almost causing a fire at home  purchased from Tesco direct we took it to the blue boar lane store  The girl on the returns desk had a complete attitude from the start.  Its not our policy to give refunds without a receipt  you would have to contact the purchaser   if we did replace it you would have to have the same model   as I was talking to her she looked away and to the floor so I stopped trying to explain why I did not want the same one again. She did not want to help and if she could make the decision to turn me away I m sure she would have. I felt she looked at me like dirt and could imagine her later in the rest room saying how horrible I was after trying to patiently explain why i was not happy. In the end she summoned the manager who took 2 seconds to advise her they could just put the £19.50 on to a gift card and send us on our way. I have been angry all day at how i was treated. I m left with the thought that maybe this is part of the reason why there has been a downward trend in footfall at Tesco.   We barely just scraped even not to mention the bag of wasted rice and cost of the trip to the chinese to quickly replace the rice as tea was ready. If this is not the best place to place this comment then can you forward it to the correct channel  Thank you  AWS					2016-02-25T22:54:57+0000	1456440897	2016-02-25 23:54:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I order a Tshirt a couple of days ago (one of which is for a birthday present for tomorrow) and It was supposed to be despatched for today. I get a text saying its been delayed for 24 hours and THEN I get an email saying one of the items has been cancelled (which is the one I need for tomorrow). I call up and am just told oh sorry its not a live site but when I say that there was 10 left when I ordered and there was 9 once I confirmed my order Im told well thats weird  that shouldnt have happened... So now Im without a present so this is going to be a GREAT start for the weekend...					2016-02-25T22:46:30+0000	1456440390	2016-02-25 23:46:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had my 8mth old in a sling (the only way to keep him from tears whilst shopping) whilst I was unloading the trolley  the lovely lady packed my entire shopping carefully  and far better than i normally could with little one in tow. It made the whole thing so much easier and far less stressful. All the while she was making polite conversation and cooing over my baby. Thumbs up! ☺					2016-02-25T22:02:39+0000	1456437759	2016-02-25 23:02:39	4	3	4	0	7	3	1	2	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I now see that my original f b post has been removed I wonder why? I would also like to now add upon having just received an email reply from Tesco that someone needs some maths coaching  my reply from tesco reads:  As you can appreciate the 1kg  is an estimated weight  which would include the packaging. The net content is acceptable variance of 10%. This is in line with European guidelines and is standard throughout the industry. This is because there is a 10% variant due to allowed variance e.g. product settling  not quite sure where the 10% comes into the equation when I was at school 800g was 20% less than 1kg.....also the packaging is infact a Lightish weight polythene bag  hey ho.					2016-02-25T21:20:44+0000	1456435244	2016-02-25 22:20:44	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ended up getting home earlier to receive my delivery on time  but it never came. I received a call this morning saying they had tried to deliver my order  which is unlikely as I did not see a Tesco car outside my flat nor did anyone ring the bell. All I can say I am very disappointed by the service provided.					2016-02-25T18:00:23+0000	1456423223	2016-02-25 19:00:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did receive all 3 bags of Cat litter thankyou so much for your help with that. I had all my order..No Substitutions either  and NO short dates...Just how I like it. I will always give praise where its due...I don t always moan you know. I have just eaten one of your Chicken and Mushroom Hotpots...They are lovely! Please do not change them..or stop stocking them. As I have Very bad stomach issues...they are brilliant. Yeah I know I eat curries..but have to take a pill before I eat one. Its just your curries are too good to resist lol You made me very happy...I really didn t want to go back to Asda s as their ready meals (And I largely live on them) are absolutely awful! I do love your food. Please don t stop doing all the nice things..or change them XXX <3					2016-02-25T17:48:14+0000	1456422494	2016-02-25 18:48:14	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Absolutely shocking setup. I have made 2 orders for digital gift codes and each time the money has been taken out of my bank account within 2 working days  I have subsequently NOT received any confirmation of my orders other than the mention in my online account order history. After complaining regarding my first order back in December 2015 I eventually received my digital code nearly 3 weeks after placing my order with no apology. Being obviously naive I put this down as a one off and decided to place a second order. But now I find myself awaiting an emailed code that I ordered 13th February!! After numerous emails sent through the  Contact Us  form on the Tesco Gift Cards website and sent direct to SVM Global Ltd  as well as a strongly worded letter sent to SVM Global Ltd 19th February I am still awaiting a response. It seems the only thing that does run smoothly with the orders is the money being taken from customer accounts. I am absolutely enraged that I have paid for goods and not received them for a second time. Trading standards is my next port of call - this is ridiculous!					2016-02-25T11:24:55+0000	1456399495	2016-02-25 12:24:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My pregnant daughter visited the store on 23/02/2016 at 7.30am  while she was there an employee decided to call my daughter fatty and put a handheld scanner near her bump and said wonder if it will make you drop.   My daughter complained and all she was offered was a bunch of flowers which she suffers  allergies and can obviously only take certain medication  due to pregnancy and to make matters worse what sort of manager sends them round at 10.30pm when my daughter would be resting  as she s 5 weeks till she gives birth. Then the store manager said to her if she ever decides to shop online they d be willing to offer assistance when they can.   My daughter then decided to take it further to head office and got told she would receive a £20 giftcard.  My daughters argument is that she feels discriminated against by them saying she should consider doing online shopping if its easier why should she have to do that just because shes pregnant. Also her confidence has dwindled because of this matter. What sort of employee calls a pregnant women fatty that is wrong in my opinion.					2016-02-25T11:22:26+0000	1456399346	2016-02-25 12:22:26	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What s the point of reviews if you re going to filter them anyway? It s not even as if it was a bad one; 4 out of 5 stars. Or do you only publish 5 star reviews??

It s my wife s birthday and went to your Paddington express store to get a bottle of wine only to have it taken off me  very rudely I might add  saying I couldn t buy alcohol at this time of night. What s the point in having a 24 hour store when most people want alcohol at this time of night. I ve now paid  £16 for 2 drinks in the hotel  very disappointed with tesco and there was no reason for the assistant to be so rude!					2016-02-25T01:43:23+0000	1456364603	2016-02-25 02:43:23	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can t believe a company so big can t check dates properly! Isn t that suppose to be a daily thing?! I work in a food place and we check dates 3 times a day  to know what s expiring when & chuck it as soon as it has expired.. What happened to first in  first out! 😡 I never made a fuss Instore because it can be quite embarrassing for myself and your team.. So I walked around with it in my trolley and told a member of staff quietly  out the way of the public! Thankfully for her response she got on the case quickly and sorted it out.					2016-02-24T23:56:17+0000	1456358177	2016-02-25 00:56:17	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Over the last three weeks the following has gone: eco wipes  4 blade box solail razors  pro hand wash  Tesco own expert stain remover  medium size Tesco colour detergent  Warburton sandwich thins  and just before Christmas Amy s kitchen Chinese noodles and Tescos own vienese biscuits. This really isn t good enough.You have gone from the store with the most variety of choice  to the least variety of choice. I am already having to buy more from Ocado  now the majority of my shop will have to be done there. I now only need  three items from Tesco  it s very disappointing. Your Stock supply is also getting very poor also leading me to buy more from Ocado.

I usually shop at Aldi and find their fresh produce to last a good amount of time.  The pack of capsicum peppers had a pack rotten dripping water on the shelf which I put on the floor. The pack I bought also had a pepper turning bad and even after Customer service swapped the pack I found it also contained a pepper going off.  I shopped on 22nd but discovered across the week that the organic green beans were  best before 22 Feb    the slimy organic carrots 24th Feb   organic curly kale 23 Feb.....I regularly buy organic veg from Abel and Cole and their produce keeps easily for a week usually so this tells me that the food on your shelves is old as it s already rotting.  I think it s very poor that I should have to rummage around the shelves veg in decent condition and that I ve been sold food that is already past its best.					2016-02-24T16:51:33+0000	1456332693	2016-02-24 17:51:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is twice I have been in the South Queensferry store and witnessed this and staff have just ignored it. I find it rather annoying as I have my own dogs and cannot bring my own in so why should others be allowed to bring theirs in just because they re small.					2016-02-24T16:41:55+0000	1456332115	2016-02-24 17:41:55	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Lapsang Souchong tea is the latest item. I tried to add these to my online shopping today. I shall just have to use Sainsburys instead as they still supply them (and in boxes of 50 instead of 20 just like Tesco used to).

This is despite the fact that the store was aware of the issue and had put up cones (stolen  but they knew this) to mark the kerb and the staff in the store when it was reported said that it was Tesco s fault and that it had happened to several people.  The person I spoke to by telephone said they had received no other reports of the damage  not surprising really given her attitude to my complaint and that Tesco has a reputation for not taking responsibility. Tesco will continue to lose its market share due to the general attitude.  When I took my car to be repaired  the mechanic said that he had heard of at least 10 people this had happened to recently.					2016-02-24T14:53:39+0000	1456325619	2016-02-24 15:53:39	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You failed to deliver. When I phoned to query this you informed me that the payment failed and therefore you couldn’t delivery. When I asked you to try again you ‘couldn’t get through to the store’. When I finally got through (after another phone call)  the payment went straight through and I was told we would receive our order before 1pm. I called again at 1.30pm to see where my delivery was and was told (after a long hold) that it would be between 2.30-3.30pm. 4pm I called AGAIN to find the whereabouts of my groceries and was told (again after a long hold) that they can’t get through to the store and that someone would call me back. I received no such call  but the delivery finally arrived at about 5pm. While packing away I realized we never received our chilled or frozen foods (the main section of our delivery). After yet another phone call to your customer services  they informed me ‘we only have the number for the delivery driver for your original delivery slot…and the driver usually notices and brings it back’. However  they will try and get hold of the store and either the store  or the driver  will call me back to rearrange delivery of the missing items. 6.30pm I called again as I had not receive my call back. I was told by the operator that they can’t get through to the store and will call me back. I did  this time  receive a call back  to inform me that the missing items had not yet been located  as there were still 3 vans to return to the depot  I would not receive a redelivery tonight. All this while I have young children at home  and we now have no food.  The operator offered me an option to refund the missing items  and place a new order (for delivery the following day) for those items. When I agreed to this she then advised me that it can take up to 5 days for a refund  however the ‘new order’ payment will be taken from my bank the next day. This is not possible as I have no further funds to cover this extra payment  as I used all my funds on the original order.  Therefore  as it was my only option  I requested that the missing items to be refunded completely  with no redelivery.   Now this leaves me with not only no shopping (all mean  veg etc. is either chilled/frozen) but no further funds to do my shopping elsewhere as it can take up to 5 days for a refund. I really cannot believe that I could be left in such a complete and utter mess.  Not only have I had to try and sort this out while in work  my husband spent his day off sitting in waiting  and we have to find a way to feed our children for the next 5(?) days!  Yes  I have now received a ‘Gesture of Goodwill coupon of £10’ on my next grocery delivery  but is this really appropriate compensation? As I will certainly think twice before using Tesco again - which is a real shame as I have used Tesco for years – so why would I need a coupon for a shop I may never do?!?!  I look forward to speaking to someone in authority who is able to take ownership of this and bring it to a mutually acceptable conclusion.					2016-02-24T14:25:07+0000	1456323907	2016-02-24 15:25:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

(After chatting to the last woman who called me and gathering the information I needed to establish which Tesco was giving out my number.)  The customer service woman  Kat  I believe  was extremely helpful and went to speak to the pharmacist who then came to phone himself.  He then proceeded to call these 10 different people liars. (He actually said  they re lying to you .)  When I asked him if I could speak to the manager he point blank refused. I was then put back on to the customer service lady who apologised.  My number is nothing like the Tesco contact number. Only the area code matches.  I was told  by the woman that called me last that she was actually given the number  in whole  by someone in the pharmacy this morning.  Now....in the grand scale of things this is nothing major and I can deal with a few people calling me by mistake  but if Tesco continues giving out my personal phone number I will be forced to change it.  How do I go about recovering that cost from yourselves?					2016-02-24T11:43:34+0000	1456314214	2016-02-24 12:43:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Here comes the but (can you feel it) But (see) I have to say how bitterly disappointed I am in your coffee... I don t mean your branded coffee I mean your tescos gold blend coffee. I usually buy Nescafé or carte noir but this week I thought I d save a few pennies (as you do) and try your coffee. Now I know when you buy cheaper the quality goes down but this is ridiculous. I thought you prided yourself on quality and when I first smelt the coffee I thought  yeah this smells alright  but when I actually made up my coffee (added the hot water) what assaulted my nose was the smell of burnt ... Just burnt  the taste was bitter and again burnt. Why would you allow your coffee beans to be so over roasted?  I don t want a refund  I don t need to take the matter further  I bought cheap and have learnt my lesson but I do think you should seriously look into the quality of your own coffee. I have now thrown the rest out and am going out to buy Nescafé instead.  I won t say my morning was ruined by your coffee but I think we all know the importance of your first coffee of the morning. I hope this helps with quality control in the future. Have a nice day 👍🏻					2016-02-24T11:14:19+0000	1456312459	2016-02-24 12:14:19	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please do comment. Seems very interesting your drivers are not aware of the highway code! Perhaps some of the unpaid taxes you benefit from could go towards training your rude  uneducated staff.					2016-02-24T11:07:27+0000	1456312047	2016-02-24 12:07:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the last few deliveries we ve had a muller light yogurt with a perforated lid meaning the shopping was covered in yogurt  several mushy cucumbers even though they were well within date  a 4 pack of lucozade where one of the bottles was split and had no drink in it and finally a punnet of grapes (which we kept in the fridge) that were covered in fluffy mould before the best before date 😕.  Standards definitely seem to have slipped.					2016-02-24T09:31:46+0000	1456306306	2016-02-24 10:31:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Her name was Jane employee Id was NS00. I pre ordered three trays of cupcakes last week from the tesco extra shoreham to be collected at 7.15am today by my husband on his way back from work today. When i ordered them i asked if they would be ready as he works nights and it would be my daughters birthday morning so he needed to grab and dash straight home. I was assured they would be ready and waiting. When he got to the store the cakes had not been made and he had to wait half an hour whilst they were decorated. This resulted in a 6 year old bursting at the seams waiting an extra 45 mins for her daddy to get home so he could watch her open her birthday presents. There was no apology or explanation from the bakery staff why they had not been done. Jane apologised on behalf of the store and ensured the issue would be brought to the attention of the stores management. She very kindly offered to reimburse me for all of the cakes sending a gift card to the value of the three trays of cupcakes. She set the standard of what customer service should be! And through our contact showed professionalism and politeness So a big well done to Jane. I believe when someone stands out from the ordinary they deserve a pat on the back. And hope Jane can receive some recognition for the way she dealt with my issue so well. Thank you again to Jane.					2016-02-24T09:21:10+0000	1456305670	2016-02-24 10:21:10	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in there yesterday trying to buy a PS4 bundle advertised online at £289  but in store at £279.  The item had been sold out  however  Sean D on the electrical desk  went above and beyond what I would regard good customer service  to ensure I didn t disappoint my son on his birthday today  or lose a sale to argos.  He spent a good half hour making different attempts to help me  before organising a instore deal  to match the one on offer that was sold out.  He was extremely polite and his attempts to keep me as a satisfied customer was well above what you normally get in supermarkets.  The usual  sorry were sold out wasn t good enough.  I left the store with a PS4 and have very happy birthday boy.  Well done Sean					2016-02-23T23:32:22+0000	1456270342	2016-02-24 00:32:22	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of the trays I opened today had a big lump of blue plastic in the middle of it. If I had not mashed the meat up before I gave it to my dog  she would have eaten it which could have caused problems. It looked like a piece of a machine had snapped possibly and fallen into the food. Just thought you should be aware that there may be a problem with a batch of this food.					2016-02-23T22:28:34+0000	1456266514	2016-02-23 23:28:34	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

First  a lady required my ID and I showed her. She told me that she wasn t able to accept my Portuguese ID card and so she asked for my passport. I asked to speak with the manager. He told me that it was true that they couldn t accept my ID. Tesco policies were the answer. In the UK I buy wine several times and when my ID is requested they accept it. In Ireland it is the same. Why was it different on wednesday? Ireland doesn t require the passport to enter the country. The Portuguese ID has is an european document with a photo photo and all the data is translated in English. went to spent 2 days with a friend in Ireland and Tesco managed to ruined the begining of my evening!  Im a very disappointed customer and this was the way I found to express it as no one listened to me at the time. I hope this complaint gets to someone and something is done regarding this.					2016-02-23T22:04:03+0000	1456265043	2016-02-23 23:04:03	15	27	17	6	50	26	9	17	48	0	15	0	0	0	0	2	0

I am a long standing customer and spend c£400 per month in Tesco - well no more.  I went to the self service tills with a basket of a few items  including wine.  When the supervisor had finished sorting her social life out  she wandered over and without any form of interaction she authorised the wine - all the time carrying on her discussion. (This was 4.20pm on 23/2/16)  When I tried to pay with a contactless card  the till went in to shock and said authorisation needed. She came over again (without interaction) and the till came back on. I  paid  again and the till said  reader unavailable  and it all went blank. She came back and I said the reader has died and her only response was  I can t do anything if that happens   and turned her back.  I walked out leaving the shopping and at some inconvenience I went to Morrison - an altogether more pleasant experience.  This store is and always has been poor but this takes the crown for awful service  Please let me know your thoughts and remediation proposal					2016-02-23T20:21:15+0000	1456258875	2016-02-23 21:21:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Strong smell of sewage. Really overpowering. Problem with the pipes apparantley.  I have a choice over where to shop  but your poor staff (who were very helpful and apologetic by the way) have no choice but to tolerate those conditions.

Today we gave out chocolate to everyone we came into contact with. This included our tesco delivery driver. My parents had to look after my children whilst my husband and I were dealing with a emotional matter and my children saw your delivery driver. My mum has recently broken her arm and he was extremely helpful  polite and well mannered. He helped get all the shopping in and was just very friendly. He returned to my house this evening with a small gift for my children. I would like to highlight his professionalism and friendliness. He went above and beyond today. He s a credit to you. His staff ID was 2102. Thank you so much					2016-02-23T18:58:27+0000	1456253907	2016-02-23 19:58:27	9	2	9	0	11	2	1	1	0	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

They died with days of each other after eating Deli Delights Duck Jerky Treats sold all over the UK but made in China. Both died of Kidney Failure. I would urge as many friends as possible to share my post on my Timeline to warn everyone of these treats  we can t have any more tragedies like this happening to our lovely Fur babies.

I am a manager of a nursery in Ipswich and a massive team of managers (around 50!) came to the nursery and revamped our baby garden! Over a matter of weeks  Mandy the community events co-ordinator from the Copdock store in Ipswich and a few managers had several visits to hear our ideas  listened to our ethos and took on lots of pictures of ideas we had! Today we were extremley overwhelmed by the generosity of tesco and we would like to say a massive thank-you to Mandy and John (manager of Copdock store) and everyone else that contributed and worked so hard today! Our baby garden has been transformed with the guys doing everything from painting and planting to making us a water wall and mud kitchen! Please can you let the team that we had today know how grateful and overwhelmed we were - thank you to everyone at Tesco too for the amazing donations of resources  plants  sand  bark etc! The children will love it as much as the staff do and we can t wait to show them tomorrow and see their little faces light up! MASSIVE thank-you once again :)					2016-02-23T18:05:30+0000	1456250730	2016-02-23 19:05:30	14	3	14	0	17	3	1	2	1	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

When unpacking the order I realised that several of the items I had ordered where of incredibly poor quality.  I ordered a pack of bread rolls which were mouldy  the bananas which were ordered for my children s lunches this week have all gone brown within two days  there was a hole in one of the loaves of bread plastic leaving the bread stale  and the small packs of snack grapes that were put as a replacement were all squashed and  inedible. I have ordered home Delivery on many occasions but the overall quality and shelf life of the stuff i was sent on this delivery was unacceptable. I have had to throw the above items in the bin. I am incredibly disappointed that one of your members of staff thought that the items sent to me didn t need to be of a good shelf life or in some cases even edible. I look forward to your response in this matter as the groceries that were sent above has led me to the conclusion that I can t use your home delivery service because the picker obviously didn t take any care. I have emailed but not heard anything so I m posting here too					2016-02-23T17:58:37+0000	1456250317	2016-02-23 18:58:37	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A friend has today asked where the foodbank collection point had gone in Craswell Street  Portsmouth & was told  we have had too many thefts from the collection .  This is all about turning their back on a very visible societal problem  brought about by Government  who  incidentally  Tesco give a large contribution to for it s election campaigns  as do ASDA. Embarrassing for these high street stores to be associated with a failed system.					2016-02-23T13:40:55+0000	1456234855	2016-02-23 14:40:55	0	13	0	0	13	13	5	8	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Are girls not allowed to like Paw Patrol because the pjs are not pink?? Is my little girl according to you not allowed to like Paw Patrol at all because it s a  boys cartoon .... It s like saying I can t like Batman  cos Batman is for boys. I like Batman  and Star wars and Transformers. You did this with Star wars clothes and Minions. Surely in this day and age you can put these clothes together and let us parents choose. After all the year is 2016. Not 1916.....

My husband is bedbound disabled  and cannot be left alone. My one 4 hour a week period of respite is precious to me  especially as we are moving from a house to a bungalow shortly. I cannot get out and shop except on the rare occasion when a kind friend gives me a lift. I bought several items in the post Christmas sales from you  (I think it was at the Holmbush branch)  iIncluding a pair of ankle boots with fur lining. Because it is so long ago now  I no longer have the receipt. I went to wear them yesterday  and found to my dismay that the security tag has been left on one of them  although I don t recall it setting off the alarm on leaving the shop.  Bearing in mind that I cannot get to your stores  and don t want to pay for a taxi to my local branch and back which would cost more than the boots  what is your suggestion please?					2016-02-23T12:31:35+0000	1456230695	2016-02-23 13:31:35	1	10	1	0	11	10	1	9	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a selection of treats for myself including a box of Cadbury s Egg and Spoon  only then to find out when I opened them inside my home that there was no spoon to eat the Eggs. Therefore I m unsure on how to eat them as I do not have a spoon small enough. This has unfortunately ruined my night as I was looking forward to eating them.

Not where I usually shop  but I am coeliac and it was the only place for miles around where I could get Schar seeded gluten free bread. My partner asked me to get him some Foxes chunkie cookies. When I saw them on the shelf  I noticed they were marked up at £1.89  which I thought was very expensive as both Asda and the co-op have them for £1. However  I wasn t worried as I have seen your advert on tv for your brand match  so I was content  knowing that I would be refunded the difference at the checkout.  When I had paid  I checked my receipt and noticed that I hadn t been refunded the difference so I queried it with the checkout operator. She was extremely rude  and said  obviously you won t get it  you need 10 branded items . I pointed out that it doesn t say that in the tv advert  and her reply was  well  everyone knows  I asked how everyone was expected to know  when it wasn t mentioned in the advert  and she said  it s obvious . She then proceeded to serve the next customer. I have just watched the advert again  and at no point does it mention that the brand match requires you to buy 10 branded items.  I am annoyed at the Mis-information given in the advert  I am frustrated at not being given the brand match  and I am disgusted at the attitude of your staff. As I said  I seldom shop in Tesco  but due to your excellent gluten free range I have been tempted to change that. This experience has convinced me that I m far better off continuing to do my shopping elsewhere.					2016-02-22T23:43:53+0000	1456184633	2016-02-23 00:43:53	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was wondering if you have stopped stocking Tesco rich tea fingers in all stores? The last 2 I have been in haven t had them and my little girl adores them with her milk before bed! If you have stopped could you not have given notice as I would have stocked up instead of having tears before bed now!					2016-02-22T23:15:57+0000	1456182957	2016-02-23 00:15:57	0	7	0	0	7	7	4	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Earlier today  having scanned my purchase  I reached into my pocket and pulled out some loose change to pay for it. One or more coins (I was looking at the screen not my hand so didn t see how many) fell from my hand and landed in the wide gap at the front of the scanning plate thing. I heard the coin/s fall and looked down to see that there was one just visible inside the gap. I called an assistant over and she looked  but told me that they have no way to open that bit in order to retrieve anything that may fall into it. No complaint about her: she did her best and she did offer to give me something from the till. The trouble was that I have no idea how much money disappeared. The coin we could see was not clear. It could have been a 2p or 10p piece or a pound. I have no idea if I lost one or more coins into that gap so I couldn t take it out of the till when I didn t know how much it might be. Having a large gap at the top of the machine  big enough to swallow coins  is bad enough  but staff having no way to open it up if something falls into it is ridiculous. I m out an unknown amount of money because of it.					2016-02-22T23:09:04+0000	1456182544	2016-02-23 00:09:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had just come back from my holiday in France and my neighbour informed me that she heard a massive crash  saw your van drive off hastily and it was never reported by your driver. All I was offered initially after lots of problems chasing this up  was a £25 Tesco voucher (and I had to suggest compensation to even start that conversation) - Insulting much?  I had to press for more and finally  all I walked away with was a lengthy repair job and a £50 Tesco voucher for the massive inconvenience of losing my car for a week  having to be in for it to be picked up and delivered back  having problems with the hire car company months after also  as they charged me for toll crossings their own staff made in the car  hours on the phone  constant chasing as you couldn t find details of my first call etc etc...  Now i ve just discovered that my partners insurance has increased by £45 as I am a named driver and my renewal is due next month so am expecting a big increase there too. We insure 4 cars between us so as a result  every year for the foreseeable future  as a result of your business  we are going to be considerably out of pocket - and all I got for all this trouble is a £50 voucher to spend on your products which i m sure the cost price is mere pounds....  Even though no claim was made  the insurance company of course has decided to increase our premiums anyway..   So Tesco  what are you going to do to put this right? If your driver hadn t hit my car  while  might I add - I wasn t even in the COUNTRY  let alone in my car  so it is not the slightest bit my fault... I wouldn t have faced all the stress  inconvenience and now financial losses that I am enduring. You as a company have assets of £44.214 billion (thanks wikipedia) so surely you can do better than £50 worth of your finest stock (remember you originally suggested £25). I earn considerably less than 44.214 billion  so £45 is a lot of money to me.  I am not greedy  I would like you to make things right so I am not out of pocket as a result of your business operations. I really like Tesco. I spend hundreds of pounds every year and enthusiastically tell all my friends how much I love all the unusual products I find in your store. Please don t ruin yourselves for me.

I ordered online and the shopping came from the Hardengreen store in Dalkeith. I was held up at the dentist  then I had to collect my son before trying to rush home. I had missed his call and he left a message explaining he had tried but no one was home. I called back immediately and luckily he was still in my street. He waited the 2 minutes for me to get back and then helped me unpack as he could see I was flustered. As a usually punctual person who hates lateness I would have expected  and deserved  quite a grumpy response from the driver but he was very polite and understanding. Made me realise that I need to be more accommodating when people are late for me. So thank you Mr Delivery Man as my son and I can now enjoy our afternoon together rather than me trying to organise to come and collect the food or get it redelivered!					2016-02-22T12:46:30+0000	1456145190	2016-02-22 13:46:30	6	4	6	1	11	3	3	0	2	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I spoke with your very polite customer services team  but they were unable to help as no one in the Amersham store picked up the phone this morning  nor have they contacted me after receiving an email from your CS team! Placing the order in the first place was hard enough  it came across as a chore for them  at one point they wanted me to walk the store and get the items so they could barcode them!  No wonder you are losing customer to competitors  or I ve got it wrong and you can afford to throw away £1000 sales??? One very frustrated customer!

I went in to the Pharmacy in Haverhill Tesco at the weekend to ask advice from the Pharmacist about a condition my husband s been suffering with for nearly a month  only to be told dismissively that the only medication they had for it was what was on the shelf. I then asked if they had one specific product and was told no - I later found it on the shelves.   Surely a Pharmacist who fails to ask questions about the signs and symptoms is just a shop assistant and surely a shop assistant who doesn t even know what products they stock is not a very good one!  These in-store facilities are supposed to be proper Pharmacies  but in this case they were  very little help .					2016-02-22T09:41:16+0000	1456134076	2016-02-22 10:41:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There was no reason given as to why my review was rejected  so do I take it that Tesco just don t like people to know that there is a defect with it that could end up with a serious incident occurring. Even if Tesco might not want it published in a review  I d have thought that they d have maybe wanted to know a little more about the issue as they are selling a potentially very dangerous electrical item.					2016-02-22T00:30:29+0000	1456101029	2016-02-22 01:30:29	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I buy Jaffa oranges every week for my working week and recently the oranges were down half price which for me was a treat. But what I have just noticed is  when is was at half price there was only 4 oranges but at full price there is 5 oranges which is the amount there is normally. This might seem petty but I find it disgusting. It s not a true reflection on the term  half price . Why it this happening? Shouldn t there still be 5 oranges to make it truly half price?					2016-02-21T21:17:03+0000	1456089423	2016-02-21 22:17:03	2	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called and spoke to a lovely lady called Gemma (MB32) and she was so helpful. She went out of her way to reschedule my delivery and called me back to confirm everything. It was refreshing to have such a high level of customer service and I want to thank her and Tesco. I tried to do this on your contact page but could not. So thank you Gemma. The delivery driver from Exeter Vale  Steve was again so helpful. I apologised for the change. He said he left the depot 5 minutes early to ensure he would be ale to deliver my shopping later on in the evening. Again kudos to Tesco (Exeter Vale) for their help.					2016-02-21T20:49:31+0000	1456087771	2016-02-21 21:49:31	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Products have been randomly taken from the shelves and when I approach staff members even managers about the possibility of reinstating them  they have been nothing short of rude.   This may not seem like a big deal to most but when your child is allergic to dairy and soya it is. Especially when it s staple items!   Further more the choice of Easter treats is awful. There isn t one item in the entire selection that is suitable for my son.					2016-02-21T19:09:04+0000	1456081744	2016-02-21 20:09:04	2	5	2	0	7	5	3	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We booked our delivery slot for between 2 and 3  it turned up at 5.40! We had 4 automated calls stating a later time each call  the last call was at 5.20 saying delivery would be between 2 and 5.10 (obviously 5.10 had been and gone). I think its shocking a company of this size can t deal with delays more efficiently than you have today. You expect delays around busy times of the year like christmas but even then I wouldn t expect to wait as long as today.  We have 2 small children and todays delay has resulted in being stuck in the house.  The only positive thing i would say is the driver who delivered our shopping could not apologise enough for the delay  he was still working despite not having a break or finishing at 3 like he was meant to!  I look forward to your response					2016-02-21T18:27:41+0000	1456079261	2016-02-21 19:27:41	0	3	0	1	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Third time in a row I ve purchased this milk and been dissatisfied now. On each occasion there has been over a week left on the best before date  and on each occasion the milk has been shown to already have begun denaturing   rendering it completely useless in hot milk based drinks.  As far as I am aware it is heat  light and oxygen that cause the denaturing and therefore it follows that somewhere in your supply chain thus product is being neglected and exposed.  As the product doesn t clearly state that it s unfit for use in the circumstances I subscribed  I m sure you must agree that until this problem is remedied it should be withdrawn from stores as it is unfit for purpose!					2016-02-21T16:10:05+0000	1456071005	2016-02-21 17:10:05	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

No it was not just another reminder why I use Tesco less than I used too.					2016-02-21T15:04:45+0000	1456067085	2016-02-21 16:04:45	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After an incident at your store today she helped a man who had been jumped and was obviously irate. He ran in bleeding asking for a phone for the girl behind the till to say no and not help at all. She came out minutes later and helped the man and called the police. A difficult situation to be in as the man was obviously intoxicated too. She remained calm and acted like a human being by helping unlike the shop full of customers and your till staff!					2016-02-21T12:50:40+0000	1456059040	2016-02-21 13:50:40	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was shocked to hear a story today about the Tesco store in Stockton on Tees. A friend of mine had been talking to the staff in the cafe explaining that when they go in for a meal they have to take other foods in for their Autistic children because of sensory issues and the staff had told her it was not possible. She was approached by another mother who told her that she visited the cafe earlier this week with her disabled teenaged son who was wheelchair bound. She bought something to eat and drink for herself and proceeded to feed her child the only way she could  and that was liquid food via a tube. She was approached by the staff and told she could not feed her child there because it wasnt food bought on the premises. I am gobsmacked and it just shows of another way the disabled are discriminated against. I am now boycotting this cafe and am considering the store too  things need to change. This poor mother was not only embarassed in front of other people  she was shown no compassion or understanding from the store. This has to stop. If you agree with me  please share this post and lets shame the store into re-thinking their policies. Thanks! xx					2016-02-21T10:24:31+0000	1456050271	2016-02-21 11:24:31	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Would just like to thank you for placing back your frozen stawberry & banana smoothie mix at the Holmbush store in Shoreham as you took them off the shelf a few months back. I buy these in bulk every week but there is one things that is upsetting me  at first when I started to buy the berrie smoothie mix they were full off berries as it say on the label. Now you have started to add bananas to them. Dunno what this is all about as on the packaging there is no mention of bananas  plus we have strawberries and banana smoothie mix for that... As you say  every little helps. Can you help me with this?					2016-02-21T08:13:37+0000	1456042417	2016-02-21 09:13:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had waited for this day for months. It was incredible and worth the wait. 😁 Scan over  we clutched our precious memories and popped over to your Witham branch to grab something quick for dinner. Having stumbled across your meal deal; two mains and two sides for £6  my husband was fair overcome with joy and amazement. We purchased enough pizza to feed a small army  (or one pregnant lady!)  and duly scoffed the lot once home. Since then  hubby has  (several times)  mentioned how brilliant your meal deal really is! He just can t stop going on about it! 😆 It really goes to show that food is the way to a man s heart  (although he s obviously thrilled that we have a healthy  happy son on the way!) On behalf of my expanding family  thank you for the noms! 😀					2016-02-20T22:04:47+0000	1456005887	2016-02-20 23:04:47	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I placed a clock and collect grocery order which I also collected yesterday. In the order was the family pack of petit filous (16 pots).

Having worked in several large organisation on policies and procedures I would have thought they were duty bound when changing a policy to still accept the vouchers that were sent out by Tesco Clubcard and already in the pipeline  i.e. over a six month period these would all be used up and obviously Tesco Clubcard would not be issuing any more of these and the site then explains that e-vouchers have now taken over?   I personally feel this is the only fair way to treat your customers.

I forgot to ask for a parking voucher so i went back in to Customer Services and said  Sorry  Can i have a parking voucher please  here is my receipt . The young girl who i asked  was there talking to a man  didnt even acknowledge me at all and looked at my receipt and didnt do anything or say anything to acknowledge what i simply asked for. UNACCEPTABLE customer service  especially at the Customer Service Desk. And then when the man she was speaking to handed me some vouchers  my husband told me she laughed at me when i told her shes just pure rude. Absolutely angry  my husband stopped me from making a scene in Tesco to teach this young girl about customer serivce. This happened today 20/02/15  10minutes before i wrote this post. I am livid to say the least as I am a very loyal customer..... not a happy customer at all.					2016-02-20T19:09:28+0000	1455995368	2016-02-20 20:09:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When used with Bicarbonate of Soda  you use two parts Cream of Tartar to one part Bicarbonate of Soda  so it is ridiculous that Cream of Tartar is sold in stupid little sachets  yet Bicarbonate of Soda is still sold in tubs.					2016-02-20T18:19:03+0000	1455992343	2016-02-20 19:19:03	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I put a box of finest chocolates in my trolley displayed at £6  but they scanned at £12! When I spoke to the assistant he took off the price scrupled it up and put it in his pocket!  Told me they are £12  I asked to speak to the manager but was introduced to Harry who was very condescending and refused to let me purchase the chocolates for the displayed price  they also refused to let me speak to the manager. I left the store a very unhappy customer which disappointed me as I ve shopped at tesco for 30 years and never been so unsatisfied.

I have just received my Tesco grocery delivery ...the young gentleman was not only polite but very helpful carrying the crates into the house for me . He was a little late (only 10mins) I had no problem with this and he straight away offered his apologies although it wasn t his fault.    He is a credit to Tesco and deserves the praise for his friendly demeanour and positive attitude !

Before leaving I made another purchase of Heinz baby juice and some snacks for my grumpy little angel. After paying and pouring the juice in my daughters bottle and her sipping away I then realise the  strong smell of bleach was coming from my purchases. I went to the desk to make a complaint where the lad at the desk said she looks fine nothing to worry about I did go on to ask if he had kids his reply no. I then asked if the first aider could look at her as she was getting a rash above her lips he looked shocked that I would ask and told me he cant do anything really no point so anyway got the first aider called the doctors was told to take to to a and e which my husband did and waiting a few hours and seeing a specialist we were told to keep an eye on her. For a while she was really hard to settle par normal. Tesco you said you were going to get the purchases tested to see what had spilled on onto the packages and you would update us. I have received a letter saying its not your responsibility that this had happen and that we should be complaining to company of the purchase good. It was an unknown source of liquid that was spilled on your store how can you not be partly to blame for this. The other company wants the evidence that you took of us to get tested I bet there in the bin we have no idea what the chemical was. You just lost a customer and i will be taking this further after all it does concern a 6 month old baby. Its a joke really is you think customers would be a prioty especially when it concerns the health and well being of loyal customer.

I purchased a hot chocolate fudge cake from your Padiham store last night  the one on offer at £2.75. The sponge was fine  but the frosting seems to have been contaminated with something  the taste was really quite vile the nearest I can describe was a bitter metallic taste.

This morning  one of your staff brought in an older lady who was having terrible trouble with her hearing aid  which had come apart. The lady appeared to be a bit distressed as she couldn t fix it herself  and obviously couldn t hear what was going on. Your staff member had tried the pharmacy and then came to us to ask if we could help.   Unfortunately we don t have an audiology service so we couldn t do anything with it. Between the two of us we rang a few local GP surgeries to try and locate a nurse or someone who may be able to assist  we tried to find a local hearing centre  but we couldn t get anyone. Throughout  your staff member chatted to and reassured the lady  kept her calm and promised not to leave her until it was sorted. She took the lady back to Tesco and planned to accompany her to the hospital to have the unit put back together and refitted.   Thankfully  as I later found out  two nurses had seen the situation back in Tesco and managed to get the hearing aid working and refitted so the trip to hospital wasn t needed.  I believe the girl was called Roisin and works in the store on Antrim Road  North Belfast. She went over and above her duties and made an enormous difference to the lady in her time of need.   I don t expect Roisin (I really hope I ve remembered that correctly) will see this but if she does  I d like her to know I was really impressed with how she helped that lady and honestly believe she made a vital difference to her.					2016-02-19T22:39:57+0000	1455921597	2016-02-19 23:39:57	130	23	130	5	158	23	10	13	48	0	126	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today is the final straw  Everyday value whisky discontinued. Everyday value tinned dog food discontinued and everyday value dry dog food discontinued.You had already discontinued the everyday value fruit that I use to buy and also the double length toilet rolls. I can get all these products of a better quality at Lidl and that is where I will now go. I would have you wanted to retain customers not push them away.					2016-02-19T20:16:18+0000	1455912978	2016-02-19 21:16:18	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have always used Bero or Homepride but from now on it will be yours. I use everyday value goods everyday and find them as good as or better than the named brands. When Lidl/Aldi advertise being cheaper  they always put their own makes against named brands..... I think you will find your everyday goods work out cheaper.					2016-02-19T19:53:42+0000	1455911622	2016-02-19 20:53:42	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 13 year daughter and her friend along with my 5 year old daughter walked to Tesco Bettystown this afternoon. They went to buy a six pack of fruit juices at my request. While there my daughter text me from the juice aisle to say there was no six packs would she just buy 6 pack of water. I replied to her saying I think they have the 6 packs up in the fridges along with orange juices and apple juices. Going to Tesco minimum of 4/5 times a week I know where each item is better than the staff at times.   On returning home the girls had a 6 pack of water. They said while in the aisle of juices a security man approached them and told them they were in the aisle too long. The girls feeling intimidated  picked up a 6 pack of water and were then asked by same security man   are you going to pay for them . The girls replied they were and  were then asked   if they had enough money? . They were then told to move to another aisle. Feeling embarrassed and intimidated the girls went to a checkout to pay when they were again told by same security man to move to another till point. I have gone to Tesco to speak with this security man ( employed by  Noonans  security) and spoke with a produce manager named   Dave  which got me absolutely no where and quite honestly annoyed me further. Their excuse was there was about 50 kids in one aisle ( none of whom were with my daughters and friend. My daughter said there was at most 10 people in the aisle ( not all children) and it was ONLY the girls the security approached.  I cannot get over the treatment of three children in what is essentially their local shop which I spend approx 200/300 euro per week.    EVERYTHING our family buys from  groceries  toys  birthday cards  school essentials for 4 children  clothing  CDs  household items etc is purchased in Tesco Bettystown.   I can only finish by saying I m extremely upset at such treatment this evening.					2016-02-19T19:36:56+0000	1455910616	2016-02-19 20:36:56	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our 23 month old toddler is dairy and soya intolerant and on a strict diet. We were pleased to find that this loaf was ok for him and after initially checking it haven t done so again. The last couple of months our son s eczema has flared up to the point several different treatments have been trialled and to the point of steroids being the next option as well as he s digestive symptoms flaring up. We were most upset to find out that the loaf we believed was safe for him has had the recipe changed and now includes soya. Although the packaging did state  new  it was not obvious or clearly marked that the ingredients had been altered. It was only through a friend informing us of this and since he has stopped having your bread he has started to improve. We feel very let down by Tesco and your approach to customer safety. We just thought we should let you know in case other customers are affected in this way.

I believe the both fruit and veggies do not need plastics at all.  This is a negative impact on the environment. Plastics take millions of years to decompose and the recycling process uses energy like water and electricity which is a waste of good resources. Do not sell any plastic bags  if you want too use 100% Biodegradable bags. I believe that they should not even be sold in the grocery section. You really have to become more concious and positively influence customers to make better consumer choices.

It s one of the dangerous faulty machines with a known fault and this shouldn t have been available for sale. As my transaction  was with Tesco  you should be replacing this machine with one that is safe. It is the retailers responsibility not to sell faulty goods.					2016-02-19T13:35:59+0000	1455888959	2016-02-19 14:35:59	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I spent ages on the phone and was assured that the items would be there even though we were running out of time for our timeslot. We we told on the phone to bring my ID. My partner went back to the store  which isn t around the corner from us by the way and was told that our shopping was no longer there  because you collect it from a van outside the store and the van has gone we would have to collect it at two  my sons birthday party is at three and the groceries we have ordered include his cake and party bags. He managed to get him down to 1pm and he was also told he didn t need ID.

I already complained once and I did get a refund and voucher but don t want to keep doing so and looking like the boy who cried wolf. Not sure why I still continue to buy meat from tesco  suppose I m just hoping for the best but getting let down time and time again.  Having friends over for dinner this evening and have gone to the fridge this morning to find that the meat has yet again gone off and I m now going to have to go and buy more and spend double 😔 all the other products I buy are excellent so can t understand why such an issue with the meat.					2016-02-19T11:05:50+0000	1455879950	2016-02-19 12:05:50	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t believe it s popular demand  rather than it will save space for you! Croissants aren t meant to be cut in half and spread with something  they are meant to be eaten by tearing a little bit off and spreading that  or dunking it in your coffee  so the shape doesn t really matter.   Also  will you be renaming the product as  croissant  actually  means  crescent ???					2016-02-19T10:54:01+0000	1455879241	2016-02-19 11:54:01	1	3	1	0	4	3	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was promised delivery on certain dates and they did not arrive  my item was then lost  I was then given another wrong date and incorrect new reference number. Another item I bought at the same time was then apparently out of stock and so I never received it. Then tried to leave a genuine review of the item on the website and it was  moderated  and not posted. No compensation offered.

I was totally dumbfounded and  if I m honest  embarrassed when I was refused the sale of a bottle of Jack Daniel Barbecue Glaze because it was before 10am!!   I understand that tesco are governed by strict licencing laws  but come on!! Bbq sauce! If this is the case that it can t be sold prior to 10am due to licencing laws then it should be stored in the alcohol aisle with the other alcohol products.   Tesco have shown a complete lack of common sense here! I am extremely disappointed and will be reconsidering where I do my weekly shop from now on!					2016-02-19T10:02:44+0000	1455876164	2016-02-19 11:02:44	9	17	9	0	26	14	5	9	5	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

She parks there regardless of alternative spaces!!!   I ve spoken to our Store Manager  Richard  who s advised that there are 2 disabled spaces in a very small car park  so they re always getting used by other customers & visitors to the local airport as well.   The colleague in question has been spoken to by Adam and will be spoken to again  although Richard is confident this only happens when there are no other spaces. He will ensure the car is moved as soon as possible if this is the case in the future. - Mike					2016-02-19T07:19:40+0000	1455866380	2016-02-19 08:19:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to give you some feedback regarding one of your delivery drivers tonight. My little boy  who is 4  looks forward to our tesco delivery arriving so much as he loves bringing the shopping in and helping Daddy. The driver tonight was so good with him  he helped him with the bits of shopping he could carry and handed him the items. He also referred to him by name (after hearing me calling his name) and this made my son so happy. He was a real credit to your company & absolutely made my little boys evening!					2016-02-18T22:28:00+0000	1455834480	2016-02-18 23:28:00	11	4	11	0	15	4	1	3	0	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

I realise the price upon order placement is a guide price  but surely that s only really applicable when you are ordering products by weight  not a standard sized product that is ordered and delivered on the same day.   I wonder how many customers don t notice they are being charged far more than they thought when ordering?  Although your customer service advisors are happy to make things right (a positive for you)  I d rather not have to check every single receipt against my order email for inaccuracies.   And don t get me started on the fact that the iPhone app randomly and regularly reverts to  with carrier bags  despite the fact I have NEVER had a delivery with bags.  Finally  when you can collectively get your heads around how to deliver beer without at least one bottle leaking its contents all over the rest of my delivery (which has now happened 3 times)  I might consider renewing my delivery package. Right now it feels like I m paying you to induce a headache   Yours sincerely  A highly gripped-off delivery saver customer.					2016-02-18T19:38:56+0000	1455824336	2016-02-18 20:38:56	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

His is due to your customers effectively entering into a contract to advertise  on your behalf. Could your legal team confirm where Tesco stand  please? Also  I was informed by one of your section managers  when trying to source a FREE box for my purchases  that should I use your  click and collect  service  if I pay 49pence  I can request as many carrier bags as I choose. I was thinking of doing this. I thought I would check first  because I have no desire to bring my  once loyal  custom back to a PLC who seems not to care any longer  despie being my nearest supermarket. If you could clarify these points  you might get a little smile  and maybe even some custom!

Looking at my favourites there are 21 items that you no longer sell  some items are disappointing but others are really annoying  eg my toothpaste (due to sensitive teeth and having tried others I can t change it). In addition to the items you no longer sell there are 37 unavailable items. So thats 58 items I cannot buy. What is the point of me ordering online delivery to then have to go to another shop for the rest of my shopping? Once my delivery pass ends i may have to reconsider where i shop					2016-02-18T17:48:53+0000	1455817733	2016-02-18 18:48:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was going to purchase the 500G console with FIFA 16 but it was not in the store.  Your salesperson recommended another bundle that was a 1TB console and included Halo 5 Guardians  Forza Motorsport 6 and Rise of the Tomb Raider which was £329.  I decided to buy this and also purchase FIFA 16 separately.  I was not too concerned with two of the games as they are too old for my children to play on  but I knew they would like the Forza game having played a predecessor on their Xbox 360.  After getting it home and setting it up I eventually discovered that the three games were not part of bundle and were simply advertised to buy on the side of the box.  Despite your member of staff assuring me that this was an excellent bundle when getting the three games  all I now have is the Xbox one console and FIFA 16 for my children.  I am now going to have to pay another £30 for a game my children were promised by one of your members of staff which will take my spend up to nearly £390.  I realise that all companies need to make money  but to have a member of staff state that a product includes something that I then have to go out and purchase again is frustrating to say the least!  I will certainly think twice about making large purchases based on your advice in future.					2016-02-18T17:19:32+0000	1455815972	2016-02-18 18:19:32	3	5	3	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

All is good and well with that apart from bags  now I know you have to charge customers but I feel I don t  have that option of getting points for using my own (I could have no bags but I  usually have quite a lot of shopping and feel it would take me forever and a day to unpack it all ). as my delivery man asks for any used bags to go back to the store   what I suggest for online shoppers who return their used bags we get our 40p refunded or clubcard points as a reward . I know 40p isn t a lot but I usually get 3 deliveries a  week and over 52 weeks is over £20 a year .  Please give my idea some consideration I feel it would be in customers best interests . regards Terri Muxlow					2016-02-18T16:10:42+0000	1455811842	2016-02-18 17:10:42	1	5	1	0	6	5	4	1	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst another young lady took my order  a cappuccino with skimmed milk and no chocolate sprinkles  I noticed this young lady begin making the coffee with semi skimmed milk.  I didn t say anything in case it wasn t for me  but when I heard the first young lady tell her it was without chocolate  I then watched her carefully remove the chocolate and then add more foam to the top!  When I then declared I didn t want it and explained why  she retorted that she had used skimmed milk and abruptly poured it away!  Her attitude was terrible!  Perhaps this young lady would benefit in training in customer service and also the dangers of food intolerance!  Incidentally  my two autistic children were with me and luckily their order was correct  otherwise things could have turned out quite badly!  I would welcome your comments regarding this incident Tesco!					2016-02-18T15:59:00+0000	1455811140	2016-02-18 16:59:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Especially the frozen section. I ve been between 3 stores in Belfast today all over the head of some free from onion rings and ice cream cones! One store had actually cleared the entire Free From/Vegetarian freezer section completely and after 3 goes round the rest of the freezer section and no one to assist me  I finally gave up and moved on to the other two stores  where between them I was able to procure the goods. It s as well I really  really like those onion rings.					2016-02-18T15:58:10+0000	1455811090	2016-02-18 16:58:10	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have written to their Complaints Team in Dundee over 1 month ago and never received a response. I would have emailed the complaint originally but was told they didn t accept email complaints. In this digital age  I find this policy astounding for a FTSE 100 company. I have since written to the CEO in Milton Keynes 2 weeks ago and still no response. How much do they value my custom and how does this Complaints policy reflect on Tesco.

Dont get me wrong  it tasted lovely  well the 2 slices i managed to use  after spending a good while playing a game of   Try and get the slice of bread to stick together with butter  for around 10 minutes. Now dont get me wrong  im all for a challenge  but after paying  i think around £2.50 for this said loaf  those lovely two slices that managed to stay together average at £1.25 each  which in comparison to a whole loaf of Hovis for a quid  seems some what unfair! I know im special  needing gluten free bread and i think its great that you now make your own  just we already have such a small choice of stupidly priced bread...so could you not try a wee bit harder to improve the quality.

The ps4 came with a free game. Although there were only certificate 18 games available. Tesco will not exchange it for something more appropriate for his age. Very irresponsible.

My only complaint is no access to a bin.A customer service lady kindly put the cores in the bin for us then we carried on with the shopping.Could a bin go next to the free fruit stand so kids can go back and deposit their rubbish or a small fruit bag they  can carry their cores/peel in until they can get to a bin after the shopping has been done ?

We were looking through the the apps and games on offer with the iPad Air. When a customer service assistant from electricals Richard. Asked if we could move out of the way as he wanted to show a couple the iPad. Not are you finished looking or do you need any help with this. Very rude and not acceptable to be speaking to people like that. I use this tesco on a daily basis and have never experienced such rude staff! My custom is just as good as the people he was serving.

The delivery driver was lovely and I rejected some bread as it had a shorter life than they d like. When unpacking my shopping I have items with use by tomorrow and Saturday and when I rung the customer services the guy was less than helpful. Said it was clearly on the website and all items use by include the date of delivery.

Maybe you take pleasure in customers wandering around aimlessly looking for their usual goods. No one enjoys their weekly supermarket shop! I prefer a supermarket sweep stealth mode attack at the task which is exactly what Aldi enables by leaving everything where it is! Tonight I ve visited Tesco to purchase my usual hair dye (to cover the grey caused by mindless aisle rearrangements!) only to discover the hair dye shelf had been rearranged and sorted by temporary dye  semi permanent and permanent dye which means my usual brand is spread haphazardly across four different shelves. This can only have been done by a man (sorry but the Just for Men product remains in one place!) I always use the same brand  mainly so I know that when I use the product I know my hair won t fall out or turn green! I spent much time searching the said shelves for my usual colour and nope never found it! Two trips now and still can t find it so have resorted to driving into town to visit Boots who have a more logical algebraic equation to how they display their hair dye products. I have got my weekly shop down to 11 mins in Aldi  shopping in your store for the same takes in excess of 30 mins together with a dose of pepto bismol and migraine medication. 🙁					2016-02-18T08:17:43+0000	1455783463	2016-02-18 09:17:43	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tonight I ve purchased a strawberry milkshake of your own brand for it to be out of date over a week . It s the 17th today and the date on the shake was 08 Feb 16 I ve been to the shop and all they could say was we can swap it for a in date one . I don t think that really solves the issues. I feel that maybe that shop needs to be looked into. I don t even wanna get food or drink there again now even if it is my local one. I am really shocked it s over a week and half out of date. That shows they haven t paid attention to their stock take at all and all the out of date stock in the shop.

She is now in tears having to pay nearly £100 for her and the other young mother  plus children that  she was going with  whereas she had enough vouchers to actually get them all into the Zoo.

(It s the last thing I want to do at 20:00  but needs must).  I got to the check out to be greeted by a nice gent who served me. He asked if I wanted any bags  I replied  I ll start with 1 please  (it wasn t a huge shop  just necessities). I placed most of my shopping in one bag only leaving me to carry a couple of bits. When I picked the carrier bag up  I noticed it was split near the handle. I asked the gent if I could have another bag as this one was split (explaining that I didn t want my shopping to fall out as I had glass in it). The gent replied  yeah  no problem . After he gave me a new bag  I saw him type a new carrier bag into his till. I questioned why I had to pay for another bag when the one I had was ripped. (At this point I placed the ripped bag into the new bag). He told me this is Tesco s policy and that he had to charge for the bag whether it was damaged or not.  At this point I stated to get a little agitated (I know it s only 5p  but it s the principle that it was damaged). I asked if I could see some one as I thought it was unfair of Tesco to charge me for another bag. A lady came across and explained that I could have another bag free of charge  but  I had to unpack my bag and place it in the new bag so they can send the  damaged  bag back to get their 5p back. REALLY?? She said  if you want us to exchange the bag  we need the old one back . So then I had to un-pack my bag to re-pack it again.   Is this really your policy Tesco? A lot of faffing just to replace a split bag. If I d have taken my shopping out in the car park and my bag split completely  would you have replaced all my items?   Over a 5p bag  you may think that this issue is minor (and to a degree  it is) but the whole issue just to replace it was awful. I was made to feel like I was robbing you.					2016-02-17T21:07:33+0000	1455743253	2016-02-17 22:07:33	0	15	0	0	15	15	7	8	17	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were with our 4month old son and our 2 year old son.  As we do on most shopping trips our 4month old goes in the baby seat and we let our 2 year old walk  this is due to our son being as big as a 4year old he just doesn t fit in the Seats a harness will not work as again he is to big for them!  So we were all having fun and my partner playing with our 2 year old in the shop getting what we needed for tea just a normal shopping day really.  We had been there about 15 min when my  partner nipped down a aisle while I continued walking with the trolley and my 2 year old who was walking in front. My 4 month old started to get a bit upset so I started playing peek a boo.  So after only a split second I looked up and my 2 year old was gone! I thought well he will only be down one of the aisles. So I looked up and down  one after the other from top to bottom and nothing! So I went back thinking I would catch a glimpse of him running past the top of the aisle but nothing.  At this point 5min had past so I asked a lady seeing to the shelves if she had seen him and she said no and dropped what she was doing immediately and helped look.  At this point I started calling his name. Nothing! His dad came up and I asked him if our son had come to him but nope.  So My partner went to the front of the store whilst checking the aisles again.  More minutes past an nothing! At this point panic was starting to set it in  Checking the aisle s over and over. Then a lady on the deli said she would put a call out to main entrance. Still nothing I think 10 min had past then from no where about 5 more members of staff appeared asking for a description. Than more appeared they came from no where! Every member of staff I passed wanted a description of him and everyone was looking. By this point I think there must have been about 12 members of staff checking the aisles (this is just a guess because at this point I think I was starting to have a panic attack)  Than I stopped caring about calling his name quietly  I was literally screaming for him and so was my partner.  15 min had past. I was talking to myself and crying I can t even explain what was going on in my head  still everyone checking aisles and still nothing!  I could see my partner running up and down and so many members of staff to as well as members of the public but still nothing! I over heard a member of staff say  have you checked all the normal places  to the man with me and he nodded. At this point the worst things were running through my head  I just thought if they had been checked than where was he? I even said to him  where is he  they all kept saying we will find him don t worry!  Eventually I ran to the front of store just crying and still so many members of staff I couldn t even tell you  there was a member of staff who had also ran to the doors when it began and I m not sure but I think she didn t let anyone out without being checked. CCTV was checked there was just members of staff everywhere! Eventually I heard a phone ring after another 5 min and turned around and BINGO they had found him she said!   I burst into more tears I couldn t breath I was shaking I felt sick she said someone was bringing him over  a kind man who was a member of staff asked me if I wanted some water and went and got it then another man than a lady and another lady all were with me asking me if I was ok?  Eventually out of the clothing aisle wrapped around my partners neck  he came out looking all sheepish! How could I be mad? It wasn t even possible! I gave him such a squeeze and cried a little bit more!   Than the store manager came over who had also been on the hunt came over with a Easter Egg and bent down to my son and said to him  if you can promise you will never run away again you can have this  but you have to promise your never scare your mummy again like that  my son agreed and happily took the Easter egg.   My point in all the details is because I want you to know how exceptional your staff at the Hartlepool Branch were. They stopped everything and pulled out all the stops and everyone stepped in to find my son.    It took I think about 20/25 min to find him and if it was not for the lengthy and through search and great team protocol your Hartlepool store had in place today it may have ended up a totally different way! Above and beyond by any means and you should be so proud of your Store Manager and Staff absolutely exceptional people! And what I wrote is only what I remember (all such a blur) they were probably doing a million other things to track him down whilst me and my partner were searching.  I cannot thank you enough for having such a brilliant store and finding my little boy! A parents worst fear but I know now how amazing your team there are and will forever be great-full!    Oh and just so you know he was hiding behind the beer cases in the alcohol section!!! 🙈  Thank you Tesco s Hartlepool X					2016-02-17T20:37:27+0000	1455741447	2016-02-17 21:37:27	2092	156	2092	235	2483	154	127	27	223	0	2059	0	0	0	0	0	0

When your sister drops £100 in Tesco and a stranger picks it up and hands it in.. Then the Tesco staff write all the info down and send it to their cash office. You come back in after a frantic search of the car  just in case  and ask if £100 has been handed in and are questioned about what notes and where you lost it to be sure they aren t giving it to just anyone... And are reunited with the money - overwhelmed by the honesty of all involved! Thank you kind stranger and thank you Larkfield Tesco staff!!!					2016-02-17T20:27:59+0000	1455740879	2016-02-17 21:27:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My hudl 1 has recently died (literally) the lady I spoke to said while I do my food shop she ll plug it in and get a professional technical whizz on it in the store (I did ring the help line the night before but I dont feel as thoiugh they gave me enough information on the subject). After I got my shop in the boot of car  I went back into the store and she suggested its either something loose inside or the screen bulb has gone. She also suggested getting a new tablet from Tesco Direct. She didn t feel its worth fixing my Hudl  as it may come back faulty. Just wanted to say how pleased I am with the information she gave and how well she was at helping me choose the right tablet and how thoughtful she was. Best customer service I ve had!					2016-02-17T20:14:33+0000	1455740073	2016-02-17 21:14:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Luckily I checked the dates  as it goes out of date today! It wasn t even reduced (this was at 1630) what has insulted me the most  is the fact that I told the cashier about the bread  and she said that the manager was going around the store marking down the prices of food and he has not got round to doing it yet. She then proceeded to say that if couldn t find any bread with a better date  (luckily I got the last one that had a use by date of 19th) that she would go to the back of the store and get me a fresh loaf. So  it seems blatantly obvious that this store is trying to rip customers off by paying full price for bread that is going out of date  when there are loaves with better dates in the back. One very unhappy customer  who doesn t appreciate Tesco trying to take people for mugs.					2016-02-17T19:39:18+0000	1455737958	2016-02-17 20:39:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your parent and child car park spaces and big  plentiful and welcome.  The free fruit is a brilliant idea. What would make the visit even better is if the baby seats in the trolleys were actually a little cleaner than a public WC at an outback understaffed service station. While I acknowledge this is not just a tesco problem I implore you to start a clean trolly seat revolution. Myself and others parents could bask in a world where we could take our infants shopping without the fear of needing to take them for a tetanus shot and a fresh set of clothes after checking out. Yours hopefully    Jo Jones and baby Zara.					2016-02-17T18:41:58+0000	1455734518	2016-02-17 19:41:58	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was shopping in Tesco Westhill yesterday and at 8 months pregnant was struggling to unload my overfilled trolley (nesting I think!). The checkout operator (a lovely lady with blue glasses  I didn t get her name) took over packing my bags whilst the lady on the next till (Carol  I think) closed her checkout and loaded all my shopping on to the belt for me. I m usually a very stubborn person who doesn t ask for help so it was a real treat to have these ladies step in and (in their words)  pamper me  for ten minutes. They then chatted away to me about the baby and offered to push my trolley to the car. It really brightened up a day of maternity leave filled with chores! Little things like that make a huge difference - I hope they know that it doesn t go unnoticed! 😊					2016-02-17T16:48:34+0000	1455727714	2016-02-17 17:48:34	26	4	26	0	30	4	2	2	1	0	26	0	0	0	0	0	0

After ringing Tesco for a car insurance quote I can honestly say you need to change your staff and implement some staff training on how to speak to prospective customers. If you seriously think snapping  getting narky  and telling people they ve wasted your time for calling for a genuine a quote is how to do business you are very much mistaken.   Maybe someone should remind the call handlers they applied for a job supplying car insurance quotes  if they don t like doing their job FIND ANOTHER!  If I went to work and spoke to someone the way that jumped up imbecile spoke to me I would quite frankly and rightly get sacked!!   Oh well Tescos loss  Asda s gain. They can t believe how badly treated by Tesco we have been and are more than willing to call back tomorrow beating your quote!					2016-02-17T16:25:49+0000	1455726349	2016-02-17 17:25:49	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have bought these from you for the past few years. To my surprise you have every other type of Easter Eggs apart from the Free from or dairy free. To say you have a free from food range this is very disappointing to myself and also other customers who buy your free from range as my child is dairy intolerant. I will now have to shop competitors who are stocking free from/ dairy free eggs.					2016-02-17T15:40:42+0000	1455723642	2016-02-17 16:40:42	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I choose to ignore the best I can as making a huge deal about it often makes it worse. As for yourself making it extremely obvious you were not happy and also very loudly  on at least 3 occasions saying it was ridiculous and telling me that it was upsetting other customers .  Would it of suited u better that I gave her three kinder eggs to eat as that would of made your shopping experience so much more enjoyable and quieter or taken her to the toilet as u so nicely suggested ( sarcasm)   what u expected me to do in the bathroom I don t really know . I left the shop upset and not really understanding how somebody can be so cruel  it s not always a pleasant experience for myself going shopping with my daughter  because she is 3 and doesn t always do what she is told or walk about in silence   but I d hope that not all people are as small minded and cruel as yourself and actually understand what the mother is actually dealing with !!!!!!!!  As for the three lady s (members of staff) at the kiosk thank you so much  for calming me down and understanding .					2016-02-17T15:39:10+0000	1455723550	2016-02-17 16:39:10	122	16	122	1	139	16	11	5	16	0	120	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a medium beef roasting joint yesterday  no mention of it being 21 day matured on the site - I checked before ordering - but I ve just put it in the oven for dinner and discovered (after it went in the oven  naturally) that it is.  I am very disappointed to have spent £8.00 on a joint that I will now not be able to eat as I can t stomach the stronger taste of 3 week old beef and am at a loss as to how supermarkets seem to think that it is a good thing.  I can t be the only one who doesn t like it  surely?  I would really appreciate it if you could not only print it on the label  but also put it in the product description on the website so I don t make the same mistake again.					2016-02-17T15:11:29+0000	1455721889	2016-02-17 16:11:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your van driver (5f/5640) has just made my little boys day! He turned 4 in January and was very interested in the tesco van and your driver chatted with him whilst I took the shopping in. He hasn t stopped smiling yet because the driver let him write his name on the electronic pad. Well done tesco  great customer service!					2016-02-17T11:27:37+0000	1455708457	2016-02-17 12:27:37	5	2	5	0	7	2	2	0	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Is this a mistake? As the large and small eggs are available for delivery until mid March? And the offer on medium eggs is only from 15th until 23rd Feb so we couldn t get them on offer last weekend but now the offer is on  we can t get them for delivery this weekend either??					2016-02-17T11:08:37+0000	1455707317	2016-02-17 12:08:37	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 2 year contract has been rubbish - CONSISTENTLY NO INTERNET CONNECTION!!!!!!! I contacted Dave Lewis which proved fruitless. I have never known such a poor service. Tesco simply don t listen  and when they do they only hear what they want to hear. I pay in full for services I only receive in part. Tesco are ripping me off - and they know it. If you want poor services  un-listening customer support  and mostly no internet connectivity ---- THEN GO TO TESCO MOBILE. Take heed - don t shop at Tesco.					2016-02-17T07:43:14+0000	1455694994	2016-02-17 08:43:14	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also the trolleys in the store are a joke  as soon as something is in them you can t steer them I ve been told by staff it s due to customer dragging them through the security barriers and it locks there wheels and they are extremely difficult to push around   also the staff have informed me that this issue is brought to there attention daily and nothing is being done  I pull my back out every time I have to use one. To be honest tesco has really gone downhill and I m moving my big shop elsewhere because there is just problem after problem					2016-02-17T01:02:28+0000	1455670948	2016-02-17 02:02:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s unfair and losing you business. I ve bought  my groceries from you constantly over the past few years  and this has been a constant problem. The £2 that is  held  on my account causes my entire budget to be off and me having to call and re-schedule payments with companies because i m short that £2. I shouldn t have to  budget around  this. I ve been told that the money is still available to me  but it isn t. it s held as a charge for 3-4 days and then returned. I really hope you guys can sort this out  because I rely on your deliveries as I cannot leave the house for long stretches of time due to disability. Your drivers brighten my day  and I look forward to my bi-weekly visits  but this is getting silly now. :(					2016-02-16T22:05:51+0000	1455660351	2016-02-16 23:05:51	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was shocked to hear a story today about the Tesco store in Stockton on Tees. A friend of mine had been talking to the staff in the cafe explaining that when they go in for a meal they have to take other foods in for their Autistic children because of sensory issues and the staff had told her it was not possible. She was approached by another mother who told her that she visited the cafe earlier this week with her disabled teenaged son who was wheelchair bound. She bought something to eat and drink for herself and proceeded to feed her child the only way she could  and that was liquid food via a tube. She was approached by the staff and told she could not feed her child there because it wasnt food bought on the premises. I am gobsmacked and it just shows of another way the disabled are discriminated against. I am now boycotting this cafe and am considering the store too  things need to change. This poor mother was not only embarassed in front of other people  she was shown no compassion or understanding from the store. This has to stop. If you agree with me  please share this post and lets shame the store into re-thinking their policies. Thanks! xx					2016-02-16T18:51:13+0000	1455648673	2016-02-16 19:51:13	0	13	0	1	14	13	6	7	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It has now been just over 5 weeks since their delivery van smashed its door into the back of my parked car. They did not admit fault until 3 weeks in  this meant I was not provided with a hire car and so for 4 weeks I was reliant on lifts  walking  buses and in some cases just not going out because I had no way of getting there. If I had not chased it up I dread to think how long it would have taken as it took a week for the case to even be allocated to someone. This has been a great disruption  inconvenience and has caused me an immense amount of anxiety and stress. Tesco was 100% at fault and is a company that earns multi million pounds profits a year and I earn less than £20 000 per year - it should be clearly obvious which party needs to do the decent thing. I was hoping that the email I sent to Tesco (10/02/2016) would get them to do the right thing but so far I have received no response or no direct apology. I am incredibly aggravated and out of principle I have not shopped with Tesco since.					2016-02-16T18:42:54+0000	1455648174	2016-02-16 19:42:54	0	5	0	0	5	5	5	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was appalled to be told that it is no longer stocked by tesco. Apparently tesco are pushing the sale of fresh baked bread and will no longer give customers the choice of plain or freshly baked bread. I have been a loyal customer of tesco for more years than I care to remember and I am disgusted by this.					2016-02-16T18:31:22+0000	1455647482	2016-02-16 19:31:22	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 6yr old daughter saw the giant Mothers Day cards and wanted to buy me one so I asked the lady to help her hide it in a bag in our trolley for her to pay with me after. She kindly offered to take her to the till and help her pay then hid it in the envelope  my little girl is so very happy! 😊 Little things make such a difference.					2016-02-16T17:49:17+0000	1455644957	2016-02-16 18:49:17	20	3	20	0	23	3	3	0	4	0	19	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m hoping someone will be able to assist me on a product I intended on purchasing with my children today. The nutra ninja was on display with a display price of £69.99 however when I reached the tills the price rang up to the sum of £119.00 which is a considerable price difference.  I was told at the till that I would need to pay the full price or leave the product at the till. I had also purchased a large amount of fruit. With people waiting to be served I walked away with all this fruit and no ninja blender to go with it.   I find this unduly unfair and think this is poor managment of staff for not displaying current prices which has now left me greatly disgruntled with your store.					2016-02-16T15:57:35+0000	1455638255	2016-02-16 16:57:35	0	9	0	0	9	9	5	4	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When you offer a one hour delivery time-slot I don t think it unreasonable as a customer to expect the shopping to arrive within that window  however 2 out of my last 4 orders have been late - the first by 45mins and today s by 25mins. I appreciate that sometimes there are extenuating circumstances but I do think you should be notifying customers out of courtesy if their order is looking likely to be late. A 50% punctuality rate as I am experiencing currently is not acceptable I don t think.					2016-02-16T15:34:52+0000	1455636892	2016-02-16 16:34:52	6	2	6	0	8	2	2	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

The packaging says to bring them to room temperature before eating  which I did  and they still had the firmness of a rock! I have been testing them morning noon and night in the hopes of finding them even remotely edible  yesterday - 5 days from purchasing them - they would still break a double glazed window should I decide to throw one  which I am getting close to doing.... today  I got up with foolish optimism to find 4 of the six ( yes I did buy two packs ) ‘deliciously ripe’ nectarines rotten in my fruit bowl  while the other two and still rock hard. Perhaps you would be better suited to offer this product to the England Cricket Team for their forthcoming series with Pakistan! Far more useful there than in my fruit bowl.					2016-02-16T15:13:05+0000	1455635585	2016-02-16 16:13:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The tomato and mozzarella bake was delicious  the spaghetti bolognaise was yummy  the macaroni cheese was not as nice as the cheese sauce was not cheesy at all  more like a white sauce with cheese scattered over the top of the dish.

This is giving a mixed message to kids  and also caused a row when we got home because he wasn t allowed to eat them. Kids are provided with sugary foods everywhere they go these days  I really don t think you should be giving them away free  especially at healthy eating events. But thanks all the same for running the event.					2016-02-16T09:18:23+0000	1455614303	2016-02-16 10:18:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Eat it and finish my shopping. When I get home I start to feel terribly ill. I have literally only eaten the scampi so far. Next thing I know I cannot stop being sick! I think I have food poisoning from your cafe. I am appalled with the lack of food and obviously the value of the food as its made me very ill.					2016-02-15T22:05:42+0000	1455573942	2016-02-15 23:05:42	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I brought a pack of salad tomatoes  two of them had mold on where they were touching each other so couldn t be seen when looking at them  it was only once taken out of the packet  I also brought a pack of mushrooms that were rock solid and some also had mold.  today I had brought a pack of apples and a net of oranges  again  two apples that were black inside and one of the oranges was moldy. Tesco  you seriously need staff who check the fruit and veg before it is put onto the shelves because it is not acceptable to keep letting this sort of thing happen.					2016-02-15T20:34:01+0000	1455568441	2016-02-15 21:34:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I also did a shop spending over £65. I then drove 10 miles home where I realised I had been charged full price for the meal deal items. I then drove 10 miles back to the store.  I had carefully checked the shelf labels when selecting my items as I am aware   customers move things.   The side dish I chose was Dauphanise Potatoes 450gms. I was informed by the customer service lady that the Dauphanise potatoes I had picked up was a different product from the meal deal and that a customer must have moved it. I explained  no its not a different product  it s the same size  same ingredients   same name  same dish  she explained no its got a different barcode so it s not the same product. You can get your money back but you cannot get double the difference  because it s your fault  you picked up the wrong dish  To say I m beyond livid is putting it mildly. I picked up the correct product from the correct shelf but because it had the wrong barcode it s my fault. Tesco what is your policy on double the difference?  I spend thousands in Tesco over the year but am considering taking my business elsewhere.					2016-02-15T19:26:04+0000	1455564364	2016-02-15 20:26:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just to give you a heads up  you may be getting reports of food poisoning from your store near Aldgate east tube station  the sandwiches that had been marked down as reduced were removed from the refrigerator  and left on a metal trolley by the till. The items on this trolley included seafood  chicken and pork products and mayonnaise.   When I saw this I decided not to shop in your store  but we did inform the manager just before leaving that these sandwiches were at risk of giving someone serious food poisoning. As we left he was telling one of the employees to put them back in the refrigerator  despite my wife explaining that this would be dangerous.   His exact words when we explained that this was dangerous  were  I thought they would sell quickly  implying that they had been there some time. As someone who has had food poisoning from packet sandwiches before  I thought it would be best to bring this to your attention as soon as possible.  Thank you for your time.					2016-02-15T19:22:52+0000	1455564172	2016-02-15 20:22:52	1	12	1	0	13	12	8	4	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had arranged to take him and his brothers out for the day and have lunch at Pizza express. I used clubcard boost to buy restaurant tokens but the tokens didn t come through on email.  First thing this morning I called tesco clubcard and spoke to Maureen who explained that there was an issue with getting tokens via certain email addresses. She arranged for the email to be resent and gave me the token id codes for me to give to the restaurant if the tokens hadn t arrived by lunch. I was grateful but also anxious that the id codes wouldn t be accepted without the tokens. Maureen called ahead to the restaurant to explain the issue and reassured me that the codes alone would suffice and we went on to have a thoroughly enjoyable day and a lovely lunch.  When we arrived home this evening I answered a knock to the door to find a lovely tesco employee on the door step with a bag of gifts for my son and his brothers as an apology for the clubcard email fault.  This was most definitely above and beyond and we are very thankful. Please pass on our heartfelt thanks to Maureen and her local colleague and reassure them that his special day was completely unaffected by the clubcard boost issues.  Thank you once again.					2016-02-15T18:49:13+0000	1455562153	2016-02-15 19:49:13	7	4	7	0	11	4	1	3	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today  whilst struggling to get my daughter into the back of the car in her car seat due to the lack of space to open the door wide enough  I witness a women pull in to a parent and child space and walk off with no child in sight. To make matters worse  I recognise her as a member of YOUR staff. This is something I have seen many times - staff using these spaces whilst at work thinking this is something that should be a privilege to them. What s the point in having the spaces if no one is enforcing their use??? - neither tesco or the private parking company that are responsible for the car park do anything.					2016-02-15T18:07:18+0000	1455559638	2016-02-15 19:07:18	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are a planning to hold a spring family fun day on May 8th at Haverhill Rovers Football ground and are asking local businesses for gratefully received donations for our raffle.    My mum  my Dad  is the charity event and we would like to tell you a bit about it. The founder Kerry Farrant had breast cancer at age 28 whilst pregnant with her second daughter  amazingly she fought her battle with courage and bravery and won. Unfortunately her dad Sam Stewart lost his fight in September 2015. She now wants to give something back to these amazing charities that helped her & her dad and this is where we ask for your help in doing so.   As for  my mum  a dear friend of Kerry s lost her mum to cancer in 2012 and is helping at other events throughout the year.   Please message Kerry Stewart Farrant  or myself if you would like to donate. Haverhill is our local store so we can collect from there.

The assistant told me that the management wanted to change their method of packing up the surplus bananas  and staff felt that it was too time-consuming and unnecessary.  Consequently  the whole lot was just put out for waste!  I don t want to identify the branch  as I don t want to land the individual in any strife.

I have hundreds of pounds of bank fees for an account I transferred back in October... Why was I charged for an account I no longer had my name on ? Hugely difficult to resolve as once my name was gone - despite still being charged - I was told there was nothing I could do to change the billing issue.

It is most definitely not the first time I have bought items from your store in Clear water Finglas Dublin.

(Apologies but it s a long one).  I m hoping you can provide a better level of Customer Service and helpfulness than I ve received from Toshiba. We purchased a brand new Toshiba TV from yourselves over a year ago now and now it has completely stopped working. (The red/green light is just blinking away and the TV won’t turn on. I contacted Toshiba who very unhelpfully told me that as it is over a year old  it s outside of warranty and there is nothing they can do.   The Sale of Goods Act 1979  states that all purchases must last  a reasonable length of time  and I don t consider 22 months a  reasonable amount of time  especially for a well known brand . 👍 If you Google the make and model number (32W1333DB) you will see that there are numerous posts of a similar nature to mine. Also under the Sale of Goods Act  this model of TV could therefore be deemed  unfit for purpose ; as there is clearly a large batch of TV s with a fault at manufacturing which would have never lasted a  reasonable length of time .  Tesco  what are your thoughts?  I still have the original box and I am more than happy to take it back to the store from which I bought it and have you the retailer replace it.  Please help!					2016-02-15T13:07:09+0000	1455541629	2016-02-15 14:07:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One person serving and a queue of at least 7 people with overflowing baskets and trolleys. Personally  I don t like the self service tills. Half the time they don t work properly and it ends up taking twice as long to checkout the store  but this morning I had to. £82.79 worth of shopping I had to scan by myself. Now  correct me if I m wrong here. Is the cost of someone helping you to checkout your shopping not built into the price of my shopping? Why am I doing this myself? Also  whatever happened to the checkout person asking if you would like a hand to pack your goods? Ever since the bag charge came in  this added extra (which speeds up the checkout process) has been disregarded.					2016-02-15T09:56:59+0000	1455530219	2016-02-15 10:56:59	0	13	0	1	14	13	2	11	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Car park was fairly busy but nothing to write home about to be honest. All mother&kids parking spaces were taken. I parked next to one of them and before I managed to get my toddler (3years old) and baby (5 months still in group 0 car seat) out of the car woman who parked in one of dedicated spaces arrived WITHOUT any kids jumped in and drove off. Thought it was one off so didn t say anything.  After I finished with my shopping I went back to my car. Car park was quieter now and quite few spaces for mums were empty. In around 10min before I managed to pack my bags and 2 kids back in the car I have seen 2 cars parking in them. Both drivers WITHOUT kids. I asked one who parked closer if she was aware that it is designated space and her answer was  I can t care less!  Charming.  After hearing that I got my kids out of the car and went to Customer Service desk at store to ask how they are dealing with situations like this.  Answer I got just shocked me - I was advised to park in DISABLE spaces if all Parents & kids ones are full!!! REALLY??!!??  My question is where disable people will park then? Plus I m a nice and decent person and I just couldn t do something like this knowing that there might be somebody else who might need that space more than I do.  Where is the point having designated spaces for them who need them if no one in Tesco care if they are used and available for people who supposed to be using them?? If I m not wrong  Every little helps...  should start there.  Enough said I will not be in rush to any of your stores again.					2016-02-15T00:43:27+0000	1455497007	2016-02-15 01:43:27	0	4	0	0	4	4	4	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We sent our 2 daughters down to get a couple of bits  being the bright sparks they are  they left £10 of our change in the machine and came home. We sent them straight back to see if it was there and the man who had been working that area had kindly taken it from the machine before anyone could  steal  it. Thank you so much for being a decent person whoever you are. 😊					2016-02-14T13:29:41+0000	1455456581	2016-02-14 14:29:41	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

For click & collect or home delivery shopping I think it would be a good idea to point out if the items have a short shelf life. I collected my shopping on Friday and a majority of the meat I ordered went out of date within the next 2 days. Luckily I have space in my freezer for it but it s not ideal to get a weeks worth of meat that s got to be eaten so quickly for customers without freezer space :-)					2016-02-14T12:38:18+0000	1455453498	2016-02-14 13:38:18	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Being told by the girl on the Customer Service desk that I cannot purchase this game as the electronics departments staff have now gone home and no one in the building knows the key code to get into the cabinet holding the games! If that is the case @Tesco then there should be clear signage stating that the purchase of games and hardware is only available between the hours of 9am until 8pm on a Saturday!! if the store is open until 10pm then one should be able to safely assume they can buy the products on the shelves  unless otherwise stated  which it was not! very poor service  only to be told i can drive back to the store tomorrow and buy the game! Not acceptable. I will not be using Tesco again!					2016-02-13T21:21:00+0000	1455398460	2016-02-13 22:21:00	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today they arrived and we went to fit them to find they are the wrong size and are too long to fit the drawers. I am desperate to get the nursery organised before my baby arrives  we have stuff everywhere that we want to be able to get into the drawers  as you can imagine it s not convenient and it s really frustrating me that everything else is ready for our new arrival except the nursery which we can t complete. I hope you understand how annoying this is for us I would appreciate some correct runners ASAP and some form of money back.					2016-02-13T21:17:20+0000	1455398240	2016-02-13 22:17:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had spent a long day decorating so was looking forward to a lovely meal.  I cooked them to my requirements and was horrified that both my steak and that of my partner had 2 thick strips of gristle running all the way through.  This ruined our meal and our evening.  It s no wonder that Tesco is losing money hand over fist. The butcher who served me clearly had no qualifications and no talent for his trade but this seems to be synonymous with Tesco and that store in particular. It should have been closed long ago as the old manager and the new one have nothing but contempt for their customers. I shall return the cooked but uneaten steak to customer services.  Your senior management team would do well to visit this store as it represents all that is wrong with Tesco.					2016-02-13T20:08:21+0000	1455394101	2016-02-13 21:08:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My toddler was having a bit of a strop  as she usually does when we go shopping  but she was shouting and screaming a lot which can be very stressful at the best of times  she also had thrown herself on the floor and hit her head.  The lovely Manager Lady came over and asked me if there was anything she could help me with  she gave my little one a bag of sweets and an ice pack for her head and also my bigger child a bag of sweets too.  She then again offered me help with anything ! This is totally fantastic service and I would like this lady recognised for her caring attitude / well done Tescos for employing such a wonderful person! It made the rest of my shopping trip a little easier :-)					2016-02-13T18:16:12+0000	1455387372	2016-02-13 19:16:12	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Was extremely disappointed to find that it and no other dairy free ice cream was available in store - I have a 7 year old son with an allergy and he misses out on so many treats as it is. In fact the free from cabinets are routinely nearly empty and the range seems to be shrinking. There is now only 2 free from cabinets. As you can imagine having a family who is dairy free and gluten free is hard enough as it is but it s even more so when stores reduce the availability of foods we enjoy.					2016-02-13T17:56:34+0000	1455386194	2016-02-13 18:56:34	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Jan 2016 just 13 months later it no longer works. I contacted your help desk who informed me they couldn t do anything as it is out of warranty but they would offer some money as a compensation towards a new console   less than half what it cost however I felt I had to accept and said ok to this. They sent me a letter 10 days later stating they would send me a form for bank details   here I am 3 weeks after first contacting with a very unhappy son   a broken Xbox  no money towards a new one   Xbox live subscription which is not in use over the last 3 weeks and whenever I attempt to contact the help desk I m left on hold for ages!  I m normally very happy with tesco and their customer service but I can say having a disappointed son is not leaving me feeling anything less than cross.					2016-02-13T17:46:51+0000	1455385611	2016-02-13 18:46:51	1	8	1	0	9	6	2	4	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

She approached me about the Valentine Meal special and with a quiet sigh I said there was only me now (my husband died in August). She smiled really kindly in understanding and then said I deserved a treat for myself. As it was 2 mains  2 sides   2 desserts I could feed myself 2 lovely meals over 2 days AND I could also have wine  champagne  or a box of chocolates! It wasn t awkward at all and know what - I did buy the special meal as she made me feel so much better about coping tomorrow.

I ve had to write here as numerous phone calls have not solved the problem! I ordered grocery online to be delivered yesterday but only half of it was delivered. When I call customer service all I hear is promises to get in touch with the store and get my order delivered but no one actually does anything! I m NOT looking for money off coupons thanks!!!! All I want is either a refund or my groceries delivered. The level of service is absolutely horrendous! Especially from the Bradford great Horton store as they are aware of the situation and no one has bothered to get in touch with me!					2016-02-13T17:30:55+0000	1455384655	2016-02-13 18:30:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is the 3rd time I ve had an issue with this system! Ordered something late Thursday so it said it would be delivered Saturday as missed the 3pm deadline which is fair enough. I rang the store today at 2:30 to be told that my order was on the van and would be delivered to the store at 4 ready for collection. I ring back at 4:30 to double check its in so that I don t make a wasted journey and I m so glad that I did!! This time on the phone I get told that my order isn t at store and won t b delivered until Monday  at the earliest. The guy said that yes it was on the van to be delivered  but that it just hasn t been delievered  and is back at depo  when I ask why his reply is just I don t know.  Like I said this is the third time now that I have had issues and think this is the final straw and won t be ordering again. It s really annoying to be told something is going to be there and then it is not!!					2016-02-13T17:15:37+0000	1455383737	2016-02-13 18:15:37	1	12	1	0	13	12	2	10	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

You see  You re pet insurance is an absolute shambles. I ve had my dog insured with you for three years  (since he was just 4 months old). In that time he has had regular vet check ups and all of his vaccinations  we have never made a single claim on his policy and he is in perfect health (that being  perfect health  no existing conditions  and not so much as a sniffle to date). And yet each year my insurance goes up  this time you want to add an extra £9 per month!   Now once again I will state  I have make NO CLAIMS on this policy for my dog. And I pay for the higher rate policy as it is  to cover all eventualities  as I m sure anyone with a beloved pet would understand. When I called your team to speak to them they had no valid answer for this  nor would I describe them as helpful  informative or in fact particularly qualified for that which they have been employed to do - take care of your customers.   When I informed them that I had checked on their website with the exact details of my pet (the exact details to the letter  that are on my existing policy) and yet I was quoted half the price I was now being asked to pay. And at no point did they offer to match this  or try to bring the price down for me throughout a lengthy and ultimately pointless call. And at no point was I given a valid explanation  they best they had to offer me was to cancel my existing policy and then take out the one from the website.  Please tell me  with customer service like that  would you bother to go through the hassle of re-enrolling yourself with an insurance company with such atrocious customer service? I would much rather go someone else  not only will it be much kinder to my bank account  but it would seem it would be much kinder to myself (and my pet) in general.   Furthermore the explanation for the price difference was a total farce... Basically by taking THE EXACT SAME POLICY out anew  my pets imagined preexisting conditions would not be covered. Once again I pointed out; my pet has no preexisting conditions and has a fully clean bill of health  one you currently have proof of  and a new insurer would not  so why am I being penalised for this?   Your  experts  advice was ... Yeah  well sure just cancel this one and take the other one out  but if anything was to happen to your pet in the next few months it might not be covered because it could ve been a preexisting condition that hadn t shown yet... I would really like to point out at this point that YOU HAVE HIS HISTORY  and even if I took out a new policy  you would have record of his old one. Apparently this is not enough... And would not be taken into consideration  should the worst happen and my pet take ill. Now please... And I genuinely mean please  find me a valid explanation for this absolute robbery  because I am at a loss.  Surely it is not that far a stretch to imagine that in order to keep a loyal customer who currently insures 3 pets with yourselves  that the price could be matched? Call me crazy  I only have 11 years of customer service experience... Clearly I m wrong.   Get your act together Tesco. From my immediate family alone you stand to lose about 7 pets from this. All of whom I previously recommended to insure with yourselves. You supposedly pride yourself on your customer service and yet you allow Royal & Sun Alliance to make a mockery of your customers loyalty in your name. Shame on you.					2016-02-13T16:17:46+0000	1455380266	2016-02-13 17:17:46	8	17	8	0	25	17	9	8	15	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yet they are still £2 online! Is this simply a glitch in store or will the online price also rise soon? If so this is a slightly sneaky and totally outrageous price increase!! Having been loyal to this particular product and store for a long time  I ended up buying Persil today and if it suits my kids sensitive skin   then this will probably be a permanent switch as I can get it anywhere.					2016-02-13T16:13:41+0000	1455380021	2016-02-13 17:13:41	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had gone to the store today to pick up a few groceries and to replenish my first aid kit after seeing to a cut on my forehead from a fall I d taken not long before. One of your security staff noticed that my plaster was seeping and after hearing what had happened asked if I would let a first aider look at me just to be on the safe side. The first aider was friendly and reassuring and after cleaning the cut again and reapplying a plaster gave me advice on looking after the wound and things to look out for.  I m fine but had my injury been worse or had I been suffering concussion  their actions would have made all the difference. It is always good to see strangers showing kindness so I d be remiss if I didn t pass on some praise.					2016-02-13T14:32:06+0000	1455373926	2016-02-13 15:32:06	6	3	6	0	9	3	2	1	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

My housemate Cath and I have long been loyal customers of your Beeston Nottingham branch  not least for your excellent selection of quiche and nice plonk  but predominantly for the superb Tesco branded Captain Scott s extra strong tea blend. At the end of last year we were devastated to find that this tea is no longer stocked  and (having found no alternative to be so potent and peppery) rationed our last few bags over the winter  in appropriate thematic style. Since our rations have now run out  and there is no sign of our favourite affordable tea re-appearing  we here petition you for its return! Our weekly ritual trudge around the supermarket just isn t the same. Will you help us? Yours  two tea-glugging customers.					2016-02-13T13:43:05+0000	1455370985	2016-02-13 14:43:05	25	5	25	0	30	5	2	3	7	0	24	0	0	0	0	0	0

They are perfectly OK but I have to ask how stock gets so near to it s best before without being reduced to clear? Also bought Pkt of 5 Granny Smiths that are only Best before 16th Feb. Apples last a long time but should they get so close to their BB date and still be on the shelf as usual?					2016-02-13T12:48:18+0000	1455367698	2016-02-13 13:48:18	0	6	0	0	6	5	2	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m curious about your policy on parent and child parking? My local store (Abergele) don t seem to care that absolutely anyone parks in the spaces. Now  blue badge holders obviously I don t mind if the disabled spaces are all occupied  but it s usually people with new cars or sports cars - god forbid they park their nice car in a normal space!   I ve reported it to the store numerous times only to be told by security that they  cannot police it unless they see it happening with their own eyes . Which I suppose I understand  but the security I have reported it to numerous times has seen it  and I ve watched as he s chatting merrily  laughing and joking  and not actually doing anything about it. Not sure lying is staff policy these days - I d hope not.  So as I said  I m curious. Other stores such as Asda and Sainsburys impose fines on improper use of these spaces. I m assuming Tesco doesn t really care that parents with children actually need the extra room to get said children out of their car? If this is the case I m not sure why spaces were provided at all.					2016-02-13T12:01:50+0000	1455364910	2016-02-13 13:01:50	1	2	1	1	4	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

If this is the case that they do not have any more why are they still selling the items. I have contacted watchdog and under the distance selling laws now by taking the money they have accepted the order and are obliged to supply the items. I will be contacting trading standards on Monday.					2016-02-13T11:33:22+0000	1455363202	2016-02-13 12:33:22	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I sent you an email to ask for my £2 to be refunded.....which is a small ask  I was then shocked to receive a very impersonal email today (13th) with a standard copy and paste matter of fact statement as follows     I can see that the order has now been cancelled and I am sorry that we have let you down on this occasion   Your previous email stated it would arrive at our chosen destination on Saturday 13th.....so had I not emailed you  at what point would you have notified me it was  cancelled !!????   My nieces birthday party is at 12pm today  poor little girl is now not going to receive a present from her uncle and auntie.......or can you recommend a good trusted retailer where I can buy a new present in the next 57minutes?  I have responded to your  Customer ENGAGEMENT Services  email.   Look forward to your suggestions for alternative present ideas?

Last night  on my way home from work I called in for a few bits. On queuing at the checkout I witnessed the checkout operator serving an elderly couple. He was so good with them  really kind and helpful and genuinely interested in making sure they were ok. I was next in line. The Checkout operator was again really pleasant  happy  really engaging and somehow managed to WOW me without it seeming forced or because he had to. I took a look at his name badge. Mick. I went to my car  loaded my shopping and then thought that he d made such an impression on me that I needed to make sure I told someone. I went back in store and spoke with the Duty Store Manager just to let him know what great customer service I d witnessed. I hope Mick was recognised by Tesco but if not i would like to say...... Mick you are a credit to Tesco  keep up the great work and thank you for doing what you do.					2016-02-13T11:02:45+0000	1455361365	2016-02-13 12:02:45	35	10	35	1	46	10	10	0	7	0	35	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was cold last night so I called into Bicester Tesco next to the village & purchased a bag of logs plus kindling. The logs were damp & required using half the bag of kindling to get the fire going although still not very successfully. This was disappointing as you can imagine. I regularly use my open fire & have not had this issue before  I would suggest you examine your supply.

I m 9 months pregnant (literally  my due date is today!) and have been having slow labour contractions for a couple of days. Seeing me hunch over suddenly with one  Shirley joked about contractions  as soon as she realised it actually was one  she checked I was ok and that it wasn t full-on labour. She then found me a seat  collected the other items I needed from the medicine aisle and rang it all up on the till  then brought my prescription over to me  and checked I was going to be ok getting home. Truly great customer service  and definitely put a smile on my face!					2016-02-12T21:30:57+0000	1455312657	2016-02-12 22:30:57	4	7	4	0	11	7	2	5	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are the neighbours to your new store that is opening up in earlsfield London. Did you know you had an illegal brothel operating above your new store? We were wondering if you could help us as we are now getting harassed by drunk tradesmen  knocking on our doors at night and the new extension makes our entrance much more ominous. We have tried contacting the Wandsworth police but they don t seem to think it is very important.

What happens with the fact it s now under the £40 limit required for the £4 service charge to be waived given that it s not my fault it s under £40?

Hubby is not well and didn t feel like going out for a Valentines meal  so I thought I would pop down with my Clubcard vouchers and get the finest meal for £20..selected my food choices which looked WONDERFUL and then went to collect my wine....only to find out there was no red wine left only white wine or prosecco...Duty Manager was really unhelpful said there was none left therefore nothing could be done...I explained that I cannot drink white wine or prosecco (makes me ill)..still nothing..so was left with no other option but to put it all back.  Now I could understand this popular offer running out  but the shelves were stacked full of food choices  so why not sufficient beverage choice for everyone? Don t think I ll be returning..surely Tesco endeavours to try and make sure that every customer is satisfied? #poorservice P.S. they did have the red wine that went with the £10 deal and I did suggest that maybe they could substitute it for me...but no.... I couldn t pick from there as I m gluten free and there was no options there for me :-(					2016-02-12T18:59:20+0000	1455303560	2016-02-12 19:59:20	4	3	4	0	7	3	3	0	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ordered 6 items from the Tesco Easy Entertain Range which we were planning on having for dinner tonight.  I have taken my wife away for her 30th Birthday and we are being joined by a group of her friends later this evening  when we were planning on eating the times order from the Easy Entertain Range.  I have three significant issues with this:  1 Why did you online order system carry this product line if it was not going to be available?  As it states on the Easy Entertain section of your website these items are made-to-order therefore if you are not able to provide them  why carry the range as available for home delivery?  2 If these items are made to order  when it became apparent that you would be unable to meet the order placed  why was no effort made to contact me?  This is not like being unable to provide a single pack of ham etc but a whole meal  which at short notice I am now having to replay.  3 When the pick was done in store and they were unable to provide the exact items why was no substitute sourced.  Nothing on the Easy Entertain items I ordered could not have been provided by selecting different lines from within the store.  We ordered these items over a week ago so they are not a short notice addition to our order.  I and my guests hungrily await your response.					2016-02-12T18:00:17+0000	1455300017	2016-02-12 19:00:17	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And this cleaner was shouting and people was looking. This cleaner then went into the store and brung another member of staff to the carpark to find me.

Found it rather strange that you did not refer to music in shops which can be very hard to avoid and often leads me to leave a shop early. In the Sunderland Superstore today there was loud competing music from the Valentines section and the Music section - driving me to move pretty quickly to other parts of the store. You are not the worst culprit by far !!					2016-02-12T16:12:13+0000	1455293533	2016-02-12 17:12:13	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did speak to the lady on the meat counter and showed her the prawns and she said that it was because they had come in on super chilled lorries.   This is highly dangerous as the prawns then thaw again and if someone re-freezes them which is what I would have done if I hadn t noticed they were partly frozen  they could become VERY ill.  The packaging also says safe for home freezing.  You really need to look into this!!!!					2016-02-12T15:46:48+0000	1455292008	2016-02-12 16:46:48	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have done online shopping for the past 3 weeks and still I m very happy with the service. I have always had a call if there was a problem with my order as well as a text to say it s been ordered. Also thank you for bringing them up my stairs to the front door. I have back problems so find it hard to lift heavy things so it s a great help to have my shopping delivered by friendly  kind professionals.					2016-02-12T14:33:14+0000	1455287594	2016-02-12 15:33:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered some travel money from you and when I went to collect it I couldn t because the card was in my maiden name.  I agreed to pay for it on my debit card and they would issue a refund to my credit card.  This was on 26 January.  Having still not received the refund I called travelex today who informed me the refund was never requested by the bureau in my local Tesco.  They are now processing it for me but it could take up to a further 10 working days.  This now means I am paying twice for the travel money causing a significant cash flow problem this month.  I d like to register this as a complaint and see what can be done.  Please can somebody contact me or give me an e-mail address that I can contact.  Not a very happy customer at the moment!

He just kept saying no then said  we do it for one we ll get them all in here .  This is disgusting. Who does he think he is!! Get them all in here? They aren t rats. They need help and food. Not dismissive treatment.   I wasn t asking for free food I was asking to buy out of date food. I could ve lined your pockets a little more yet you still say no. I say you as it is you.

I took back my slow cooker that you had a recall notice out for on the 10th February. The article i read said a refund or replacement would be offered even if you didn t have the receipt. I went in store wanting a replacement but was never offered it. I was given a £10 gift card as i didn t have the reciept. I assumed i must have misread the article but having checked your website i discovered i was correct.

I am growing increasingly uncomfortable with not only the continued misrepresentation of the regulations by a small group of women   but Tesco s ever increasing compliance with this misrepresentation.   Such actions validate the behaviour  but worse validate some of the associated comments (I see today we have formula compared to blending a burger and putting it in a bottle).  Can I please ask  for public information purposes   that when you deal with these photos that you clearly:  1) Differentiate between the WHO Code (which is voluntary) and the Infant feeding regs (which are statutory). They are different for good reason and I am sick of seeing the Code presented as law.  2) State your interpretation of Reg 23  which specifically restricts promotional activity  designed to promote sales .  This latter part is important when apologising for the use of a red star or a new sticker.  3) Clarify your interpretation of the DoH guidance note.  As for as I can see  much like the Code  it is good practice and guidance.  I am happy to be corrected on this but I can see nothing that puts the DOH guidance (in paticular the notes on formula placement and display) on  a statutory footing.  When you break the law on these matters  it is wrong. But it is also wrong when you perpetuate myths about formula regulation when you apologise for actions that are not wrong. This action create a further wedge in the feeding wars and ultimately fuels a crusade that helps absolutely noone.					2016-02-12T07:36:09+0000	1455262569	2016-02-12 08:36:09	15	10	15	2	27	10	6	4	30	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

I put in the best answers and automatically within a split second was told I am not suitable for rhe role and that my answers were carefully reviewed. It s really annoying. I spent 5 hours to be told by an algorithm that my answers were not good enough.  Do you know what! I even searched for the  correct  answers online afterwards and many people have vented their frustration online and the answers they chose were exactly the same as mine.   One of your colleagues even proved the system is trash. He made 5 of his friends apply for a role. 3 of them were accepted and the other two failed. Funny thing is  all 5 were employed by tesco already and the two that failed worked in customer services.

So thank you very very much I will never forget such a great act of kindness xx					2016-02-11T23:55:40+0000	1455234940	2016-02-12 00:55:40	793	19	793	91	903	19	15	4	66	0	782	0	0	0	0	0	0

I followed your protocol!) I was told to come after 2pm so I visited the store at 3.30 to collect to find nobody in the bakery. I guessed as they start early they finish early so I asked a tesco colleague ( I believe this is the pc term for staff!) to grab my order.he couldn t find it so we asked a manager who couldn t locate it either.luckily there were exactly 24 packs on the shelf so I scooped them up and continued my shop. You may ask why I m disappointed  well these rolls were for a school disco which the kids had pre ordered therefore I preordered.i felt let down that your slogan every little helps ( even though I had helped make it easier by pre ordering) didn t help me and I could have been left with a very disappointed group of children.why offer these services if you can t deliver?!					2016-02-11T23:48:50+0000	1455234530	2016-02-12 00:48:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon chatting a member of staff called tony became very hostile towards us and told us we have to leave the store as we were causing a problem with his staff. Upon check out he said it was our fault and that we should get our thing and get out and was also making hand gestures and followed us to the store door. Very upset with the service provide by him. A formal complaint will be made. All the other staff are so nice  just feel disappointed that one member of staff can drive you away from wanting to shop at that store.

This is the back story...I visited the store in middle of October 2015 and whilst shopping lost my baby s blanket. I left my details with the customer service team and rang on several different occasions in the following 2 weeks to see if it had been located. Much to my disappointment it was never found.  Today I was browsing the baby aisle looking at blankets and to my astonishment  there it was! It was wrapped in sellotape with a yellow sticker marked  was £10 now £4  some 3 months later!!!!How you could ve know it was worth £10 is beyond me  as it was not purchased in your store and has no label (it was removed by myself) and still has marks on it from my son.  I hope you are as appalled by this as I am  the fact the store is selling lost property at a made up price should be addressed immediately. I advised customer services of their error and they returned the blanket to me with an apology.					2016-02-11T20:58:51+0000	1455224331	2016-02-11 21:58:51	31	56	31	15	102	56	29	27	28	0	31	0	0	0	0	0	0

He filled it up her car closed the petrol tank and as she walked to pay he assisted her as she was on 2 walking sticks and he held the door open for her.  I was freezing cold today and he was only in a shirt.

The same amount of items that used to arrive in one bag that was big enough to use to line a bin  or reuse as a shopping bag  now arrives in 4 of these pink bags which are a useless size for anything.					2016-02-11T17:24:16+0000	1455211456	2016-02-11 18:24:16	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was irate having not checked my receipt for my weekly shop at the store  but as I was going through it when I got home last night I spotted the error.  Your Lynx XL men s deodorant on special at £1.99 was a bargain for that size can  so I bought 3 of them only to find I d been charged £3.85 for one of them. They were 3 different fragrances but all had your price ticket of £1.99 by each type. You have to appreciate as I only go to your store weekly  the cost of travelling again to rectify a £1.86 would cost more to do so.   Is there any other way I can do this without incurring more costs to receive back my difference?  Many regards.					2016-02-11T14:05:19+0000	1455199519	2016-02-11 15:05:19	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The shop is closed for six weeks for a brand new store. The real reason you have closed is that the building you occupy has old asbestos in the wall cavity of the building and you had no choice but to remove them. You have done this under the guise of positive PR of a new store coming. Can t hide decontamination shower cubicles being delivered this morning and seeing building contractors with high visibility vests saying asbestos removal company. I ve been a customer to that store since it opened which must be about ten years. That s ten years of going into a store almost daily being exposed to asbestos. The side effects and illness that can occur take years to come to light so be prepared for the lawsuits.					2016-02-11T12:34:39+0000	1455194079	2016-02-11 13:34:39	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t know if u have heard about marks and Spencer doing clothing for disabled children? I m not asking u to do the same but is there any chance u could design a nappy that is larger than your 6+ size to help us mothers who have children with disabilities and who are not toilet trained at the  correct  age. I am a mother of a 4 year old with intellectual disabilities that still relies on nappies but the larger size you and everyone else does is 2 small for him. I know I am not the only parent who has this struggle and it would be amazing if we could just pop to a tesco and get what we need without the hassle of having to find a special supplier (which I haven t been able to find) after all every little helps and this would be a massive help to me and the thousands of families in the UK that are having this struggle every day xxx					2016-02-11T12:20:53+0000	1455193253	2016-02-11 13:20:53	15	6	15	0	21	6	5	1	1	0	15	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will look into this for you. Was this in the Petrol Filling Station again or in the main store? What time did it happen? Could you name or describe my colleagues who served you please?

Every morning I am met with the empty space where they should be...... Sometimes I even double dash the store after my morning work shift in the hope that there may be some.... 4 days in a row now there s not been any and I have had to either go without or buy a plain one which just doesn t cut it. It seems to happen a lot in that store where they go for days with none on the shelf..... Yet the other store Metro in Falmouth is always well stocked with these but it s so out of my way that I don t go over there just for a chocolate filled croissant although I have thought about it because they are very very tasty. Please could you tell me why this keeps occurring surely if the store are starting to run out of stock they would order more... Please get in touch as I m hoping I won t be met with the same disappointment again tomorrow morning.

She was in the widnes store last friday afternoon and it was quite busy. She said a young man in black uniform was busy and seen how much she was struggling with waiting and trying to walk and find a till as shes in her 80s and legs are very painful. He kindly walked over to her and asked her to follow him took and took her shopping off her and opened a till for her! Then he proceeded to pack her bags once hed put it all through the till. This has made my nans day and she couldnt believe how kind he was to do go out his way to help. She never thought to get his name but ahe wants to say thank you ☺					2016-02-11T09:17:41+0000	1455182261	2016-02-11 10:17:41	5	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I got home and checked online I realised you have stopped selling them in this particular size. May I ask why you have suddenly stopped stocking pampers in size 3+ (in either baby dry or active fit?). I only bought some a few weeks ago so was surprised not to find any in the shop today.  You are not the only ones  the other supermarkets have stopped too.  I contacted pampers who say they still manufacture that size/type.  I am a bit stuck now as we are using active fit in 3+ and I can t seem to get them anywhere but Boots. Thank you in advance for your help.					2016-02-10T21:26:57+0000	1455139617	2016-02-10 22:26:57	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Where do you actually get your first aiders trained ?? After coming across a member of public that had fallen over in your Pitsea store carpark   being a first aiders myself . I was the first at the scene doing all the necessary things a first aider should do checking for injures making sure they are safe ect  and most of all calling for an ambulance   then been told not to move the patient give her anything to eat or drink and an ambulance is on its way   I then informed your members of staff . To witch a so called first aider came charging out of the store   to witch I explained everything the ambulance service had already told me to her   and she took it upon her self that she was the  TESCO  first aider and proceeded to try give her a drink move her to witch she was screaming in pain . And then rudely told me she was the  TESCO  first aider and not me like it was some sort of browny point scoring test   I would  like to say:  A) I m disgusted at the way your so called first aider spoke to me . B) been  a first aider doesn t automatically make you a paramedic  C ) your staff need retraining in first aid  D) someone s injury is not a point scoring contest because you have a first aid certificate.   Please could you advise me where your first aid training takes place because of like to make sure I avoid it at all cost s .   And most importantly I hope the lady that was injured is ok after your staff man handled her .

I got to a till and it wasn t too big a queue  but after dealing with each customer the cashier paused  picked up a pen  circled my 16 pence saving I d made and then pointed it out to me. It seemed a pointless exercise when people were moaning about waiting.					2016-02-10T16:56:58+0000	1455123418	2016-02-10 17:56:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I never order with bags as I object to paying for them. On this order  Tesco have amended my order to include bags and charged me for them. As I keep original order confirmations  I was able to prove that I ordered without bags and they have said they will refund me. NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH TESCO AMENDING ORDERS AND CHARGING EXTRA WHEN THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE. LOOKS LIKE TESCO MAY BE HAVING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS - ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER FOR DISCREPANCIES!!!!!					2016-02-10T16:48:11+0000	1455122891	2016-02-10 17:48:11	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I then said I don t know who you are and therefore do not wish to give my number. The male at the other end rang straight off - so I am presume a scam to get your details!!

I went in at approx 11:45 am  with two starving teenagers.  Couldn t get chips  as it wasn t 12 pm yet  so ordered a bacon roll for one teenager  and a breakfast for me.  The guy at the till was very abrupt and not particularly friendly.  I understand that food is now cooked to order  rather than sitting under heat lamps  however  this resulted in a quite a long wait  which would have been ok  had the food been decent.  The bacon and eggs were over-cooked and covered in black debris from the grill  but far worse  one of the sausages was still raw in the middle.  The coffee was weak  and like dishwater (having often had coffee at the Galashiels store  I know it s normally a fairly decent cuppa in the cafe) Having already been unimpressed with the attitude of the staff  we left without complaining  as my teens just wanted some decent food in their stomach  and didn t want to put up with the embarrassment of their mum complaining.  Given the dangers involved with raw sausages  however  I feel it is only appropriate to bring it to your attention.  Also  having looked at my receipt  I have been charged for  Hot Food 17kgs@ £0.01/kg  Total £12.17  Why does your cafe not produce itemised receipts that make sense (basic maths tells me that 17kgs @ £0.01/kg does NOT equal £12.17)  and why was I not asked for my clubcard  when it clearly states on the receipt that I could have earned clubcard points?  And don;t even get me started about the checkout operator in the main store  who left me standing for about 30 seconds  holding out my clubcard to her  as she totally ignored me and stared into the shop floor  when I went to buy the hungry teenagers a sandwich to make up for the bacon and sausages.					2016-02-10T14:24:37+0000	1455114277	2016-02-10 15:24:37	0	10	0	0	10	10	4	6	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The service is great. I have one complaint though: why does the delivery driver get fined for delivering early? A recent delivery the driver was delivering at the other end of our short road at 7.20pm. His next (and last) delivery was me after 9pm. He called me and checked it was ok and I said it was fine. The alternative is that he burns fuel keeping the food cold while sitting in a layby  or drives back to depot and then back to us also wasting fuel. I appreciate that if I m not at home he can t come until after 9  but surely if we re in and it s not a problem  he shouldn t get penalised?					2016-02-09T23:34:38+0000	1455060878	2016-02-10 00:34:38	6	2	6	0	8	2	2	0	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I tried one and realised they re blueberry muffins. I then noticed one of your employees has stuck a label over the previous label as they ran out of date on the 7th of February 2016  it is the 9th of February 2016 (new label reading 12th Feb). So firstly you ve sold me out of date muffins  and secondly sold me something with a purposely changed label which isn t what the product says it is.					2016-02-09T23:02:58+0000	1455058978	2016-02-10 00:02:58	0	6	0	1	7	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to say my local Tesco store (Brockworth) is full of brilliant staff. I regularly shop weekly there and usually with both my girls (aged 4 and 2) usually one of them is moaning or being a tinker and everytime I feel like turning around and heading home  a member of staff turns up or takes time out of their day to engage with both children and make them smile! Whether it s helping me pack  offering little treats to the girls or just having a chat about their day... Even the time I caught my eldest stealing a sweetie from the scoop bit  they played along when I marched her to the front desk to apologise! They are all a real credit to your store!!

Now that Talk Talk have taken over it s a whole different story  very polite  sending a new router straight away. My mother was without internet for a month...I m trying not to be cynical and think that there was deliberate procrastination on the part of Tesco  knowing that the  problem  (and she was made to feel like the problem herself) would be passed on...a letter of complaint basically said that it wasn t Tesco s problem anymore...even though she d been paying for their service for nothing...who is the right person to contact with regard to a refund?  The customer services team don t seem to be worth bothering with.  Actually quite disgusted by this.					2016-02-09T17:27:42+0000	1455038862	2016-02-09 18:27:42	1	11	1	0	12	8	1	7	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

While in there a very drunk and extremely angry and aggressive man( whom I believe was stopped stealing from what other customers was saying) was causing a lot of  trouble because your manager and security guard would not allow him back in side. He was making customers  a little apprehensive in leaving the store especially the ones with children. The manager and security guard was fantastic in what they was doing  they both stayed calm and collected and focused on the situation and think that tesco need to acknowledge these to men. They where both very apologetic as we left and deserve a lot of praise by tesco for the way they handled things in there.					2016-02-09T16:08:09+0000	1455034089	2016-02-09 17:08:09	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Even on this order my fish pie mix although on paperwork says goes off in 3 days actually on the packet says it goes off TOMORROW.  My butternut squash spaghetti has turned into squash and sweet potato soup mix. .....  After learning my lesson I put on ALL perishable items for longest dates possible... Yet always end up with food that goes off in a day or two!  Seems as though home delivery customers get the raw end of the deal and given scraps that the stores need ro sell before use by dates!!

I just took delivery of todays shopping  only to discover as I put it away that the grapes have already been opened and several atre missing from the contents. Now that  for me  comes under the heading sloppiness. surely this should be noticed by the pickers?? its not too much to ask surely to be safe in the knowledge that your fruit and veg have not been molested by somebody elses grubby little mitts.

Well I am truly appalled  from googling  it seems like the is a   known fault with your Hudl s charging. My mother has got a Hudl 1  and it doesnt seem to charge at all  even when I connect it to a PC to try and hard reset it. If this was a known fault  why didn t you recall it? Absolutely appalling from your behalf  and you didn t make anyone aware of these issues. It is now beyond use  and my mother is stuck with a tablet that doesn t charge.					2016-02-09T13:39:44+0000	1455025184	2016-02-09 14:39:44	2	13	2	0	15	13	7	6	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I cooked both packs  as normal and they touched so horrible we couldn t eat them  they tasted all rubbery and had a slight green colour to them when cooked. This is first time ever in my whole 15 years shopping at Tesco that the chicken has been like that and quite frankly has put me off purchasing meat from Tesco.

I work in one of your stores and love it  so this is coming from a good place. Asda has done the wonky veg box now we need to do it. From the response on social media (frugal sites etc.) it has been a roaring success and it obviously would be in our store too! We should also do one for organic wonky veg too. The store I work in is in an affluent area and sells lots of organic fruit and veg  I m convinced these boxes would be really popular and would give people on low incomes the opportunity not only to eat more fruit and veg  but really good quality organic fruit and veg! I try and only buy organic myself and the more people that support organic farmers the more organic food will be produced which is better for farmers  the environment and us. Subject I m quite passionate about. Please put it forward to the powers that be and make it happen. How awesome would it be to be the supermarket that brings good health to the masses via affordable organic food 😃					2016-02-09T11:12:36+0000	1455016356	2016-02-09 12:12:36	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked if I could have some and they said that they weren t allowed to let people take stuff out of the bins. They came out again a couple of minutes later with another crate full of cauliflowers and parsnips. I asked if I could have some before they were tipped INTO the bin. The guy was annoyed  Look mate we don t give away free food all right . Throwing away edible food is now illegal in France.					2016-02-09T10:48:09+0000	1455014889	2016-02-09 11:48:09	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also  the pancakes I ordered didn t arrive  as apparently they didn t have any in stock - it s not like you d be expecting people to order them today or anything what with it being pancake day.... so now I m going to have to go out  and get some more milk  and buy some eggs so I can make my own pancakes - exactly the things I was looking to avoid doing by having a home delivery...					2016-02-09T10:31:24+0000	1455013884	2016-02-09 11:31:24	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whether it was to do with my complaint or not who knows  but here goes again.  How come Tesco s Hunstanton is the only Tesco s Store I know of that doesn t have Hot Spicy Sausage on the Hot Food counter in the Deli Section?  Every time I go there it either has New Yorkers on display or no hot sausages at all.  It s fine if you like mustard  personally I hate the stuff  and when I enquire as to whether they have Spicy Sausages  all I get back is  Sorry  this is all they sent us.    Yeah right!  It is so frustrating because you know they are waffeling.  Does the store manager there seriously think everyone in Hunstanton loves the taste of Mustard?????  What about the poor old Cumerland Sausages as well?  You never see them on display anymore.   All they ever have these days a chicken pieces.   Have you ever tried sticking a chicken piece into a small baggette?   It s a bit fiddley to say the least.  If I want a hot spicy sausage for my lunch the only option to me is to drive 15 miles to King s Lynn and get one  and I m not about to do that.					2016-02-09T10:17:08+0000	1455013028	2016-02-09 11:17:08	1	4	1	1	6	4	3	1	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I  would like to say I could check that all my prices that I get charged at the till are the prices that are advertised on shelf  in reality that is obviously not possible.  Quite a few times I have checked my bill when I have got home and seen that I have been charged a price that I thought was incorrect but couldn t actually prove it without travelling back to the shop and checking.  Today I only went in for a few items and was sure that I was charged incorrectly so challenged them to check.  Now it was only Angel Delight charged at 40p at the till but on the shelf was 32p and I did get my money back but I was actually quite perturbed by this as did not see anyone change anything only give me my 8p back.  Now I know it is only 8p but SURELY there are checks in place so that this does not occur and wonder how many other items in my weekly shop this happens to on an ongoing basis and without my knowledge.  I have on occasion also bought the buy one get one free and when I don t get the free one am told  oh that specific item  in that format is not on offer EVEN THOUGH IT IS ON THE SAME SHELF this is very misleading. I would like someone to respond to me as I have no faith in Tesco to keep a check on this very real problem!!					2016-02-09T09:28:05+0000	1455010085	2016-02-09 10:28:05	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I did just that and got told that they could not help me  the man on the phone said he was told to tell me to add it to my order. I pointed out that it s too late to do that  to which he said  yes that s correct .  On a previous delivery after I complained that my veggies were not up to scratch there was a compliment slip attached to the order with the store number on  stating that any problems give them a ring. When I enquired about it with the driver he told me I should not ring the number on my order if I have a problem I should ring the store.  Well the next time I have a problem with my delivery I will be phoning the call centre to complain (which I don t do as often as I should) not the store number I have been given.   Well Risca store if you are not good enough to save me an outing then you are not going to be good enough to deal with any problems I have with my orders!

Just received my weekly shop.. the driver was absolutely lovely so my rant is in no way connected to him..   What an appalling state my shopping is in.. Most of the products I ordered actually go out of date tomorrow.. This household likes its food but I doubt even they d be able to locust style their way through this munch before the already browning salad becomes inedible! My bananas appear to have suffered some kind of toddler torture as along with the teeth imprints there appear to be numerous fingernail style marks.. in addition to VERY bruised and squidgy ends.. and the cucumber........ the poor blooming cucumber seems to have been stopped dropped and rolled a fair few times before it reached my door.. The peppers are furry and the oranges are suitable for the bin...   I am utterly disgusted at the state it all arrived in.. who would fill a trolley with items that go out of date tomorrow??????. Now I know you may be thinking  well go and pick it yourself in future Miss FC  and I can assure you I would MUCH rather do this.. however.. this single parent working a busy full time job does not have the time to fight her way through your totally inadequate car park in the centre of town just to stand in queues of other disgruntled customers who have won both the car park and aisle wars and are now suffering the long slow moving line for the till ride...   My point is.. this shopping will be inedible by tomorrow.. and now it has become my problem to find the time  dig around the sofa for some coins  and replace all what is already spoiled..  Honestly it s so bad.. Just thought I d make you aware of this via this method as I am far too annoyed to phone up and have a go at someone who clearly won t need nor deserve it...					2016-02-08T21:21:59+0000	1454966519	2016-02-08 22:21:59	2	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My issue may seem OTT but as SMA have reduced the size off the tin from 900g to 800g  so I found it strange and emailed SMA directly to be informed that it is upto the individual retailers the cost off the baby milks. So I thought I d give yourselves the chance to explain the reasoning behind the price remaining at £10 the same price that was being charged for the 900g which =43 scoops that s a huge difference and I feel that you need to do something about this. I look forward to seeing a price drop in the near future					2016-02-08T20:26:15+0000	1454963175	2016-02-08 21:26:15	0	9	0	0	9	9	2	7	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s shows you your total in the shopping basket £46.45 as it should however whilst doing the shop when your including offers for example funsize bags of sweets are on offer For 2 for £2.00 instead of £2.79 each but it s not actually showing in the shopping list as this it shows £5.58  your hot cross buns are £1 buy on get one free but it s showing £2.00 same with other items I wanted to buy but as the total was what I expected I didn t think much of it until I went to pay were suddenly on the pay page my shop had jumped from £46.45 to £56.62!

I made a complaint to customer services via your website regarding one of your dot com vans. I received an email from James Abram who is the customer service operations manager. He told me somebody would be in touch with a personal response. Indeed true to his word they were  I received a phone call from a chap who works in a store in Kent telling me he had been passed my complaint. Unfortunately he also told me that he works in a store which is about 50 miles away from me  he also has nothing to do with dot com vans. I asked him if he could get someone more appropriate to contact me  he unfortunately says he is unable to do this and I should contact customer services. Just wondering as contacting customer services was my first stage of the process am I to be stuck in some sort of infinite loop???					2016-02-08T19:24:12+0000	1454959452	2016-02-08 20:24:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I witnessed the most awful mismanagement. The Dot com guys were going about there business when one young chap decided to play a prank on one of his fellow Dot comers. He hid her carrier bags. There were 3 Dot Com people in this aisle and me  as well as one old dragon of a manager whom bellowed at this young guy in front of me “IF I SEE YOU DO THAT AGAIN I’LL SUSPEND YOU DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR”. I was shocked that someone could behave like this the other DotCom people were shocked as well. When Dragon woman had gone I said to the chap “What is that things name” He politely asked why  I explained that I was going to report her as she was totally in the wrong she should have taken him off the shop floor and told him off  not on the shop floor were customers are. It really angered me. I asked to see the store manager whom admitted to me he had heard part of her bellowing  He was most interested in my side of the story  I also explained that I was going to write to the CEO of Tesco as this was bulling. I have also e mailed Tesco customer service about the dragon woman known as Sabina. I hope they sack the witch 					2016-02-08T19:24:10+0000	1454959450	2016-02-08 20:24:10	13	9	13	1	23	9	4	5	12	0	13	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have an issue with a product that I would like help with. I was sold a TV from Tesco about year and half back with the name ISIS yes that is the name. Now for almost 6-8 months I have not been able to use for obvious reasons in any open area of my house in case some one finds it distasteful/offensive as do I. Last several months only use it has seen is in the bed room with a tape on the front .. I have tried to take the front tag off with no luck.  I wanted to see if as a ethical seller you would be able to replace it with another brand any other brand at all  even if cheaper   what ever just cant have any thing to do with this Brand TV in my house.. I hope Tesco offer a few solutions to this problem.  Kind regards.					2016-02-08T14:27:01+0000	1454941621	2016-02-08 15:27:01	1	9	1	0	10	9	4	5	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It appears you have stopped selling Everyday Value Tesco Custard Powder.  I really hope not  because I purchase several packets each week  along with other supplies  to enable us to produce a free two course meal each Tuesday for mainly homeless folk.  We generally get around 30  but the last two weeks we had over 40. So I need to spend carefully - and they were incredible value when only 6p a packet  then 9p  then 15p.  Still cheaper than Sainsbury s at 20p.  But now I will have to go to Asda - and therefore I am likely to buy my other supplies there  (besides which they now stock more of the EDValue tinned meals I purchase to stock up my small Basics Bank shelf) However I do realise these are hard times and you can t stock everything.

Not metaphorically  literally!! Just popped in to buy milk  the entrance smelt like rancid B.O. which changed to what I can only describe as a stale urine smell by the back of the store. I held my breath  grabbed some milk and got out as quick as I could! Please tell the manager to clean the store more  and if need be  give the staff some deodorant.					2016-02-08T12:58:57+0000	1454936337	2016-02-08 13:58:57	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I made a complaint last week as  when I received my grocery order  the 2 packs of nectarines I had bought looked so unripe that they were green around the stem. Nectarines don t get any sweeter after picking  only softer  so I thought that I would just end up with a bitter pulp. I complained because I would not have picked these up in the supermarket myself.  I ended up keeping the nectarines because I hate to see food go to waste  and hoped that they would be edible in a pie or as jam. I found yesterday that they were softer and tried one  just to see how bitter they were. In fact  I found that they are probably the tastiest  sweetest nectarines that I have ever eaten!  I d like to sincerely apologise for my premature complaint.

Then the worst thing is I have to chase for the promised refund on the shop! I have seen them enter it on their machines - when I query 2-3 days later the excuse is - well they didn t bring the machine back and enter it in the system... I get the refund - but only because I have chased for it.					2016-02-08T12:05:44+0000	1454933144	2016-02-08 13:05:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The online application is an important part of our selection process  therefore we are unable  to progress your application any further at this stage.    However  we encourage you to review your answers before you consider applying for another role that may be of interest to you.   I now know its not the customer service screening questions  as out of curiosity I compared my answers to those of a successful candidate and found them to be identical in my last 2 applications. So I assume it can only really be automatically screened on dates to get a rejection within seconds of completing the application process.					2016-02-08T12:02:33+0000	1454932953	2016-02-08 13:02:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

That makes your £1 delievery slots partly redundant. I get £24 a week .. id have to not eat for a week just to qualify. Ridiculous. If youre loosing money on the £1 slots don t do them. No need to throw in other charges to recoup money  makes the Tesco corporation a little hypocritical. Every little helps  indeed.

So when I realised Tesco has stopped selling Bourbon Creams I wondered if my mornings would ever be the same again.  Now  being an ex stock controller at Tesco I m hoping that you re only changing the packaging or something and that they haven t been totally discontinued.  Please could you shed some light on this situation?  I m currently sipping a coffee with a terrible  cardboard tasting Home Bargains substitute Bourbon Cream. It just isn t the same.

I was on my way to visit my husband who had just been admitted to hospital.  I bought a new pair pyjamas for him.  The pyjamas are great  what was not great was that there was a security tag on the pyjamas when I got to hospital with them!!!  My husband had nothing else to wear in bed so I had to tear the waistband to get the tag out!  Please can staff check for security tags when they sell clothing items and maybe a yellow sticker alerting customers and staff to the fact that an item is tagged would be a good idea.					2016-02-08T09:22:55+0000	1454923375	2016-02-08 10:22:55	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am completely fine with the charge  however  the bags provided are the tissue thin ones that previously resided in store prior to the bag charge.

When in store today  (a busy Sunday) purchasing a gift voucher  I checked to see if I was able to pay at the self service checkout - which Adam said I was unable to pay for there....but would be ok at the customer service desk.   I joined the queue at the desk   when I was tapped on the shoulder by Adam   saying he would quickly open a till up !   Ever so happy with this as I was running late and rather than just leaving me to queue   Adam came to find me to offer his help!!

My son is awaiting diagnosis with asd and finds it hard to wait in queues and was extremely upset as we had started to unpack shopping onto one checkout and then had to find another item before returning to a different numbered checkout.  My son couldn t cope with the change of number and was very distressed. The lovely lady serving us asked my son if he would like to come round and help scan mummy shopping cause that checkout was the  best one .  He immediately smiled and went round and began happily scanning with her help. This made my sons day and he was so happy.  It was such a nice gesture and I am so grateful for both the understand and the attitude this lovely member of staff showed towards my son. Big thank you!!					2016-02-07T20:10:00+0000	1454875800	2016-02-07 21:10:00	631	75	631	33	739	75	62	13	140	0	619	0	0	0	0	0	0

So off I popped to my ever reliable local Tesco to purchase said chilli  along with the rest of the ingredients.   I have a question though - why oh why do they only come in bags of multiple chillis and not as single items?  I can buy single apples  single avocados  single oranges  single potatoes etc. But not chillis!  I now have 5 fresh red chillis with not much use for them.  Please rethink this. I hate wasting food so am now frantically googling (other search engines are available) what to do with them!

I have been to your store at Ollerton  Notts on a few occasions recently and thought that I could hear bird noises near to the bakery section.  I thought that maybe the noise was just carrying in from the outside.  However yesterday I saw 3 or 4 sparrows sat in the roof space directly above the bakery section and these birds were  bobbing  down to sit on the side of the pastry crates.  When I pointed this out to a member of staff she said that they had been there  for ages  and nothing could be done about it.  I pointed out that there was bird droppings on the floor and she shrugged.  I would like to think that this problem would be taken a little more seriously.					2016-02-07T18:03:48+0000	1454868228	2016-02-07 19:03:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My hubby went out and brought it again from else where so we could finishing watching it. He s been back to tescos to get a refund just and the deputy manager Nicky Jennings said he wasn t intitled to a refund and we re now stuck with 2 DVDs she was quite rude to him and seemed to b suggesting that he d brought back after watching it  I even said I would show her were it stopped but once again she was rude & sharp & made it embarrassing for me infront of other customers   I then asked another lady on another desk who said they can either swap it for another dvd or give cash back as its faulty  I m not going to travel 5miles out my way to take a dvd  back if it was perfect. As a tescos loyal customer I m feeling disappointed with the customer service I was shown in tesco walsall today regards Mrs G Parker					2016-02-07T14:53:49+0000	1454856829	2016-02-07 15:53:49	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am constantly charged twice.  Once again I am having to chase yourselves for money you have stolen from my account.  I wonder how many other loyal customers out there are being treated in this way and how many are not even aware. This has happened three times now and I am totally fed up.  Are you as a company ever going to do something to stop this from happening and offer some genuine apologies and compensation?					2016-02-07T12:07:56+0000	1454846876	2016-02-07 13:07:56	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My eldest sons is just over a year old as was bought in October 2014 as a Christmas present for that year. It already had to be returned in August 2015 due to something going wrong with the hard drive. Over the last month or so we have been having issues with it not charging well  sometimes you plug it in and the red light will come on other days it won t. One night it was fully charged and my son went to use it the following morning and the battery was dead. Today it will not charge at all and seems as if the charger is bending (I have seen another post about this on your page also). I have tried with another charger and it makes no difference  still won t charge.  He has also been trying to add some new games to it but it keeps saying  not enough external storage  despite deleting lots of apps/games already to free up space!  Our youngest son got a hudl2 this year for Xmas so only a few months old  it doesn t seem to hold charge very well once fully charge but at the minute will charge when plugged in!  What can be done about this?  Many thanks					2016-02-07T12:06:27+0000	1454846787	2016-02-07 13:06:27	0	11	0	0	11	11	1	10	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The drivers I ve had so far are always  happy  polite  helpful and professional.  The one I had this morning didn t even say hello when I opened the door  he just started complaining at me how he couldn t get in my back garden to deliver my shopping. When I explained that I didn t write that on my delivery instructions and that if he did he would get greeted by my two dogs who I always put in the garden so they don t hop it out the front door. He then went on to say in a sharp tone..well there was no where to park at the front so I had to park down the road and walk up. Then put he s hand up and was very sarcastic saying don t worry though don t worry! He then didn t speak to me after that. Normally the guys are really helpful and always offer to help bring the bags in. Or at least pass them to me at the door out of the creates while I m running back and forth.  This rude man just stood with his arms crossed...still not speaking  then handed me the device to sign and walked away.  So angry and disappointed!					2016-02-07T11:02:35+0000	1454842955	2016-02-07 12:02:35	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In order to get to my car I had to walk with my 3 children through their fog of cigarette smoke and because of the wind direction the kids ride on toys were also subjected to this fog.

I was hoping to go in and get a pizza from your pizza counter and at this point it was still staffed. I asked the woman behind the counter if she could make a pizza as there was a poor selection left that were pre-made. The woman on the counter said that she was leaving early. I pointed out that the counter s stated opening hours said until 8pm. She said that wasn t her problem and carried on packing up her things.  This is not the first time that Trowbridge s pizza counter has closed before its stated time and it keeps occurring. I also think that the member of staff who was on the counter this evening needs to go on a customer service course as she was just plain rude to myself and my friend and I would not expect this from a member of staff representing yourselves Regards Hayley Hoblyn					2016-02-06T22:09:03+0000	1454796543	2016-02-06 23:09:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Items missing from the order. Last time it took them a week to resolve. The store manager told me that missing items could be sent out the same day. Today  bread missing from the order  phoned through and was told no. Complete contradiction to what the store manager told me. The store were not at all concerned and neither were customer service. When I told them to cancel the delivery service agreement  they just agreed and did it  they made no attempt to resolve the matter to keep a customer happy. Very poor service  will look to shop with Sainsbury s from now on.					2016-02-06T17:36:47+0000	1454780207	2016-02-06 18:36:47	0	3	0	1	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

(3L) I only knew about this recall after seeing on a Facebook slow cooker page that the slow cooker I had was being recalled due to safety fears. I then checked Tesco website for recalls to check the status of the recall  but was unable to see the slow cooker on the website  luckily our local newspaper posted the recall info for my slow cooker on their FB page.  Return for a REPLACEMENT or refund the information stated. I wanted and need a replacement. But no  apparently the Eastbourne store do not have any in stock and do not know when they will be in Stock  surely the store knows how many were sold? Surely they could work out how many would be required for replacements. I asked if they stocked alternative slow cookers  yes they do  but they cost more  no surprise there really  after choosing an alternative replacement I was then informed I would have to pay the difference. £7.50 difference!!!!  Did Tesco purposely have no stock?? I am quite appalled that a company the size of Tesco would not foresee that people who only purchased the slow cooker recently would want a replacement (as promised in the recall leaflet)  I am now without a slow cooker  a cupboard full of slow cooker sauce packs and a freezer full of meat that I can not now cook!  There is now no January sales for me to afford a replacement  how I wish I had purchased the one in the sale from Lakeland. I shop weekly at Tesco  I am now thinking my loyalty is better off somewhere else.   Can you please explain the recall and replacement policy to me  because to be quite honest I think what happened to me with this recall is quite atrocious.

I believe in supporting my local dairy farmers who are struggling. I don t want to buy foreign  British or English butter  I want to buy Welsh butter. I m sure you never stocked Welsh butter in English stores. I ve asked customer services in local stores and been told there is a block on ordering tesco s own Welsh butter to resupply the stores.					2016-02-06T15:57:53+0000	1454774273	2016-02-06 16:57:53	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I don t drive  I use the service offered  whereby you purchase your goods and arrange for a delivery. I had finished doing my groceries and was waiting to pay and arrange delivery  when a man approached me and explained that the driver had become locked in somewhere. Because of this  they were unable to deliver. I was also unable to carry all of the goods home with me as it would have been too heavy. The man offered to arrange for delivery later in the evening  or to have the goods delivered tomorrow. Neither option was good as I needed most of the items immediately in order to prepare dinner. I ended up having to leave a trolley full of items  that I had carefully selected  in the store.   I understand that emergencies crop up from time to time that may make it impossible to deliver groceries. What I most certainly don t understand  is why an announcement couldn t have been made over the PA system whilst I was shopping. When I put this question to the man  he seemed unable to offer any sort of explanation.   Well over an hour of my time was wasted. Unacceptable.					2016-02-06T15:39:43+0000	1454773183	2016-02-06 16:39:43	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went into Tesco New Malden  I was asked for my mobile number  a security question and my d.o.b  all answered correctly. I have been with Tesco mobile for about 7ish years on a pay monthly contract. I was told that I needed photo ID. No where does it say this. I do not drive  so I said  I have my NHS ID with a photo  not good enough for Tesco  although I am a loyal and I thought trusted customer . They have all my information on their data base. Still not good enough! I have spoken to two managers in store  who were passive aggressive  condescending and patronising. Since then  customer services have emailed me  I have spoken on the phone  I have had a phone call from the store all to no avail. Can Tesco afford to lose loyal customers in this day and age?					2016-02-06T14:59:19+0000	1454770759	2016-02-06 15:59:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Until a couple of years ago  the only ones you could get were dark chip  then some bright spark decided to start changing them all over to milk chip  and the Cafe Continental ones were wonderful for remaining dark.  Neither of my children like the milk chip ones as they find them sickly  and I know several other people who also gave up on choc chip brioche due to the change over.  Very  very disappointed to have our go-to breakfast on the run taken away :(					2016-02-06T14:50:53+0000	1454770253	2016-02-06 15:50:53	0	10	0	0	10	10	2	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Over the years I have ordered from tesco  usually once a month I place an online order for a big shop  very handy when you don t drive. I now here a teenage girl found a rat in her online order. I am very disappointed that in my years of online ordering not once have I had a rat in my online order! I love rats and have always wanted a pet so to get one for free I would be truly grateful! I am expecting next time I place an online order to receive a free rat with my shop as that teenage girl did.

So we found a grossly pink TV in your store. Set it up this morning after she opened it  puff of smoke. Dead tv. Should be simple to exchange surely with the receipt.  Nope.  Tesco trostre Llanelli said they want to send it off to repair. We didn t pay for a defective repaired tv I purchased one that should be perfect. Called customer services they said they should refund or replace and put us through to a service reception for trostre store.  Spoke to the original staff member  ( young male) who again refused to replace or refund and asked my husband if he was special and called him a rude old man (he s 35!). We spoke to the manager  Ian who was just as rude. My daughter heard all this and it s really upset her on her birthday. Another store have said no problem they ll sort it and fforestfach tesco have refunded us. I don t want to buy another from tesco I ve lost faith. I do think it s important that this gets written because some of your staff need retraining.

A horrific lack of maintenance means that water is currently pouring  not dripping  through the roof in many locations. This is then running through and out of the electrical fittings including lighting and fire detection.   Your staff are forcing customers to exit the store via a fire escape which forces the customers to then walk along a road only protected by a white line  but the amount of water on the road means the line can t be seen and all passing cars are throwing water over people as you walk down the road. As I was walking down this road a car came within cm of the trolly containing my 2 year old son.   Your staff in this shop show no sympathy and the managers have failed to ensure that there are enough staff present.   All in all a wonderful experience.					2016-02-06T10:35:08+0000	1454754908	2016-02-06 11:35:08	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought that all Tesco products particularly meat were of a high standard  but this certainly makes me question that. The standards that these birds are kept in should definitely be questioned. I know its a value bird  but even so  this falls far below my expectations from Tesco.					2016-02-06T10:22:37+0000	1454754157	2016-02-06 11:22:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner bought a tablet from your store on the 22nd of December as a present  which out of the blue  broke on its own accord. We were directed to a phone number after a half an hour discussion with the IT man in store who couldn t help us. After this we rung the number provided who asked us to send a picture  his response was that there was a hard drive issue and that he could would give us a swap out number to return free of charge. Unfortunately the receipt  after having this for one month  was thrown away so they asked for proof of purchase (a screen shot of the bank card transaction) which clearly shows this. Now after all this hassle of talking and be redirected to a number of members of your Tesco staff members we are still left with no replacement. Which is extremely disappointing as I am frequent visitor to my local store  and have spent a lot of money on quality products. I hope that you will deal with this issue promptly and look forward to a positive response. Regards  Thomas Algar.					2016-02-06T09:53:45+0000	1454752425	2016-02-06 10:53:45	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also will you ever be looking to upgrade clubcards to be like nectar cards where you can use the card to deduct the  vouchers  directly at the till? I really think it s time you did! Not everyone has a printer or wants to wait for you to post out the vouchers every few months.  Thanks!					2016-02-06T09:48:07+0000	1454752087	2016-02-06 10:48:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased a reduced item but was charged full Price and so I went to the customer service desk and seeked a refund. I was given the money back I was owed but when I asked about dtd I was told because it was not on the display I was not eligible ? . I have never heard this before in all the years I have shopped in Tesco   I was made to feel embarrassed for even asking.					2016-02-06T06:03:56+0000	1454738636	2016-02-06 07:03:56	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

While me an my boyfriend were at the self service area we noticed that 4 members of staff were chatting off to the side  one of the bagging areas had some alcohol on it but the customer was nowhere in sight and his till area was flashing for assistance. The customer reappeared with an extra item and then explained to us that he had been waiting for a member if staff to show up for him to continue  he said that being as he was waiting we would go and get something else but had expected someone there by now.   This customer did shout over to the 4 Tesco staff for help  to which one of them did reply with  I m not working  Not one member of staff was willing to help with something so simple as scanning their card! At this point another customer needed help also. Eventually someone did come over and actually work (not the ladies gassing away) but no apologies were made to these customers.  In fact the lad that was waiting for so long left the shop with us  to the taxi waiting for him with his friends..It took so long for him that his friends actually cheered him back!  To me this was shocking  I understand that people have different duties while at work but surely a little but of good customer service goes a long way. If it was me that had been waiting you would of lost your sale as I would of just left and gone elsewhere!					2016-02-05T23:17:07+0000	1454714227	2016-02-06 00:17:07	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are going away for the weekend and placed a massive Tesco order six days ago  including all of our food and drinks for the weekend.   We just found out that our order has been cancelled  without any notice  as apparently they forgot to put our order on the truck as there wasn t any space. This is of course completely ridiculous  especially as we placed our order 6 days ago. We now have to frantically drive around town to get our groceries  instead of having a nice and relaxed weekend.   They have refused to compensate to deliver it in the morning or to find another slot.   We will not use this delivery service again due to this lack of professionalism  and the unreliable service.					2016-02-05T22:34:46+0000	1454711686	2016-02-05 23:34:46	5	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have asked in store and they are on the set up system but none have been sent. I can buy them in other local supermarkets and fortunately we do have 4 other in a 3 mile radius to choose from but I do do my weekly shop in your store and would prefer to be able to buy them there. I also know I m not the only person who has been asking this.					2016-02-05T20:55:13+0000	1454705713	2016-02-05 21:55:13	1	10	1	0	11	10	3	7	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Stop wasting wonderfully tasting food because it doesn t look how someone in an office in a city thinks it should look!!!  It will also help our struggling farmers from going out of business!!!!!

We ordered a lot for my Granny s 80th birthday party  and went to you guys because you usually have better dates and produce than Asda... However that s not the case this time.... Considering the list below was delivered yesterday (4th Feb at 8:30pm) here are our problems: • chicken (dated 07/02) (5+ days shelf life had been selected) •strawberries (dated 05/02) •peppers (dated 05/02) • avocados (dated 06/02) • a ham joint ordered 2.5kg  got 1.25kg (which is no use for a party...) •potatoes (dated 08/02) •romaine lettuce (dated 07/02) • coriander (dated 06/02) and it looks like it s dead already...  Although the strawberries and peppers were highlighted as short dated  we accepted these because we live in a small town and were not guaranteed to get access to anymore.  Safe to say your delivery has caused more stress than celebration....  Although couldn t fault the delivery driver.   Can someone please get in contact with us  we are very unhappy with our delivery.					2016-02-05T20:45:27+0000	1454705127	2016-02-05 21:45:27	3	8	3	0	11	7	1	6	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I complained and got a full refund  and there has obviously been a review of quality control for this product since  as I had the same meal this evening and it was absolutely delicious  with no traces of nasty hard shell.

Totally ignore a very elderly gent trying to get 5 value frozen meals out of one of your chillers that he could not reach. The ensuing groan and  tuts  as I pushed them out of the way to simply  help  just confirmed they obviously hated him as a customer  and their obvious social  issues  showing the world how much tesco  cares  for its customers. I truly hope all four grow to be at least 100... In their pads  sitting in their own cold excrement  one word.... Karma! Ignorant  ill mannered disrespectful  shameful..... tesco managers..... I doubt they even noticed! Far to busy discussing products and targets.... Shame on you Bar Hill Tesco.					2016-02-05T19:10:57+0000	1454699457	2016-02-05 20:10:57	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon walking to the customer service desk to advise of the mess in the aisle I was met by 3 members of staff who were incredible. They were so helpful and went above and beyond what I would have expected from them. They were all so kind to my son and helped to clear him up without any fuss  even when he was sick again.   One of the ladies got him a spare pair of jogging bottoms as his clothes were covered in sick while the other got him some water. They helped with my shopping and upon walking back to my car  one of the car park attendants offered to help me with my trolley back to the car. The cleaner was also extremely kind to me/my son.  All too often people are quick to complain and don t give credit where it s due. I really was so grateful for their help. Well done to them :-)					2016-02-05T17:28:09+0000	1454693289	2016-02-05 18:28:09	2955	84	2955	113	3152	84	61	23	120	0	2930	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought a Tefal frying pan back in August with a life time guarantee & already the surface is sticking. I contacted Tefal direct & was told the guarantee is only for the non stick surface not coming off  sticking food is not covered although I have looked after it as the manufacturer suggests. So they won t help but told me to contact the Tesco store I bought it from baca use my contract of purchase are with them & it s less than 12 months old. So I contacted my local store  Jarmans Parkin Hemel Hempstead & they have told me there is nothing they can do without a receipt & that sticking food would not be something they refund me for anyway??? Firstly who on earth keeps a frying pan receipt for a year? And what would be the point if Tesco are not prepared to exchange it for a new one or give a refund anyway....Not very happy  looks like I ll be going elsewhere to shop in future!!!!					2016-02-05T14:46:07+0000	1454683567	2016-02-05 15:46:07	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The item had a countdown timer displaying I had over 8.5 Hrs to place my order to receive it in my local store tomorrow (Sat). Once I had placed and paid for the order the email informs me delivery will now be Monday!! I called customer services for an explanation and was told the operator would call the warehouse then return my call this morning. I received no return call!! I then returned to the Tesco website this afternoon and it is still displaying a timer showing several hours left to order this product for delivery instore tomorrow. I called Tesco back and was informed delivery was definitely still going to be Monday! Why advertise next day and continue to do so when there is absolutely no chance of this happening  this is a poor sales tactic and very misleading. Most annoyingly I could have got another retailer to price match Tesco on this item and collected in store today!					2016-02-05T13:59:49+0000	1454680789	2016-02-05 14:59:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I really need some questions answering about my booking for the community room there and nobody can/will help me. I am being fobbed off with  the person doing that has left...It could be a month before anyone deals with your query...put it in writing and someone will deal with it at some point . I thought I was getting somewhere when given a name and a number but even when calling when I was told he would be in I only get voice mail and nobody calls back.  This is really poor and if I ran my business like this I wouldn t have a business for very long.  I have been in store and asked. I have rang. I have used Facebook messenger to the community room page  all to no avail. Perhaps your regular Facebook page will bring results.					2016-02-05T13:45:06+0000	1454679906	2016-02-05 14:45:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Others had it cheaper online  but with yours I could get it from a local store. Checked it was in stock - it was. Missed the click deadline by five minutes so drove straight to the store knowing it was in stock to pick one off the shelf. Was told it would now cost over £300. Explained to the customer services team  that I could  click and collect  on my phone and in about 12 hours the actual laptop she was holding would be mine for £239. But as I hadn t it was over £300. I explained this didn t make sense and was told  it s because you re buying online . Ok  I said  but if I wanted to pay online  other websites are cheaper than you... So  why buy anything from you? You re more expensive in store AND online? And to top it off you won t price match other stores  including your own website.					2016-02-04T23:15:29+0000	1454627729	2016-02-05 00:15:29	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Imagine my shock to go into the Tesco Norwich Harford Bridge Superstore at 10.00 pm and discover the manager thought that was an appropriate time to clean the frozen food section with the ready made meals!  If I could shop earlier I could shop elsewhere.  The store is open 24 hours  surely they could have waited until after midnight to clean the section!  And even then just done one part at a time.

HOWEVER  tonight I had a slot booked 8-9 it got to 9:15 and I rang customer service to ask them where he was (a lot of the time they will ring if they are late)  she apparently rang him and he was 30 minutes away. I just had a call from tesco saying they couldn t track the driver  phoned customers to find out where he is and he is running an hour behind. I said  that s not what customer support said and he said  that they could not get hold of him. I m not sure if I am angrier that he is late or they lied! I m a nurse  I m up early (4:30) tomorrow and could do without this!

My friend and employee expected a delivery from Tesco groceries..  the van drivers partner crashed into her car..  he was holding the wing in his hands when he knocked on door! he was the drivers partner...  the driver was too embarrassed to get out of van.    Tesco are visiting to assess damage 6 days later.. tomorrow and they added a bottle of wine to her delivery!  As she can t drive the car she is out of pocket on taxis and very inconveniently having to get friends and family to get her to work.  We drove 30 miles and lost valuable work time today due to this so now you re effecting me too! I would drive 100 s of miles to help my friend and you should bed ashamed..  she has a young family and works and volunteers 7 days a week!    No offer of courtesy car or having car collected to be fixed over weekend.  Tesco driver took lots of photos of broken bonnet and wing etc and admitted their fault as car was well parked and stationary. So your office had evidence immediately.   This is outrageous and a courtesy car should be dropped off at her house in the morning at the very least. I do hope the media are alerted to your shoddy customer care.  The driver had a simple accident which we have probably all done however how you deal with that problem afterwards is speaking volumes!  Shame on you!					2016-02-04T21:36:53+0000	1454621813	2016-02-04 22:36:53	4	20	4	3	27	20	6	14	10	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

However in view of the days news re Arla and the price of milk  what about your comment  This helps Tesco in our pledge to   continue to pay a market leading and fair price for its liquid milk  which is at least the cost of production .  Ok  so what does one live on and pay the bills with  milk.					2016-02-04T20:42:11+0000	1454618531	2016-02-04 21:42:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m very disappointed with the product and they 3rd party seller. I bought a Saxon drift bike on Black Friday for a Christmas present  found out on xmas eve the back wheel & gears was damaged (box was perfect) your staff give me credit to take the bike to halford to be repaired  it couldn t be fixed  so your staff arranged for a replacement and collection of the broken bike. Your 3rd party seller refused to collect the bike because it didn t have a box. so I had to return it myself to a store  who initially refused to take it.  3 weeks after the new bike arrived it again has broke. This time it s the gears  my son has been on it twice since we got it. Again I ve been offered a replacement  on the basis that I can return the bike to a store  again the 3rd party seller refuses to collect due to no packaging. I don t understand why the packaging is such a big problem  the bike is fully set up in the box apart from the handlebars and front wheel.  I m annoyed about this because I paid for delivery for a reason but have to return myself and my son has to wait yet another week for another new bike to be delivered which was his main Christmas present from Santa.					2016-02-04T20:33:59+0000	1454618039	2016-02-04 21:33:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I reached the till I was told I couldn t have them as they had an emergency recall on them  to say I was disappointed was an understatement  as my granddaughter would have loved them.   Tonight I went into the store and picked up a keyring in the form of a cuddly toy giraffe and when I went to the till  I was stunned to be told  AGAIN that they couldn t sell it to me because it was also on an emergency recall!!  This has happened to me twice in less than two weeks  what is going on Tesco? Perhaps you should employ me to find all the stock that is on recall because I seem to be very good at finding it  without even trying!!					2016-02-04T19:28:39+0000	1454614119	2016-02-04 20:28:39	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I appreciate that I didn t have my receipt however a) it s a recall which isn t my fault and b) surely in this day and age you can check via club card etc? I have therefore had to return home with my faulty slow cooker after a wasted journey both ways and now also run the risk of mine being one of the faulty ones. I have my weekly shopping delivered every week from Tesco and have done for numerous years but safe to say this is making me think twice about the customer service you offer!!					2016-02-04T19:01:17+0000	1454612477	2016-02-04 20:01:17	1	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Christmas day arrives and as you would expect their little faces lit up when they each had a brand new tablet. All was happy until both Hudl s gained seperate problems. Me being me wasn t very happy with this so phoned tesco customer care and asked for my money back ( I found out that the christmas return policy did not apply to me because im an on the ball kind of parent and bought my presents early in october). So I begrudgingly accepted this and agreed to send them both for repair (1 was taking 15 hours to charge the other kept crashing aka black screen of death) after nearly 2 weeks and plenty of tears from the kids beacause apparantly why would santa send them broken toys they were back from repair. Happy days you would think  but NO !! after 3 days of being back 1 of the Hudls has crashed and cant do anything with it black screen of death again So my question to you Tesco is can I now have a refund for BOTH Hudls because quite frankly im getting a little cheesed off with the fact that these are brand new out of the box and have now broken twice since dec 25th !!					2016-02-04T18:44:57+0000	1454611497	2016-02-04 19:44:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have very much enjoyed your wholed  Reduced Sugar  range of jams for years. They are really the only brand of jams i can eat. I had a delivery today only to discover to my horror that you have changed the entire ranged to no added sugar  they are now vile with sorbitol which i cannot eat. Thank you tesco. I have a very limited diet as it is and it was a joy to have your jam. Thanks for ruining this last remaining treat for me 😢					2016-02-04T16:25:39+0000	1454603139	2016-02-04 17:25:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My local only had one of the items left.. So I drove up to the tescos 10 miles away from my home to get said items  for them to be full price (took them to the till anyway  because of your price guarantee  AND they shouldn t really be different prices!) to be told by the manager there was nothing she could do because you don t brand match your OWN stores! So basically you can rip people off in different stores?! Completely wrong and a massive waste of my day! Thanks Tescos  every little helps  ey!!

My wife was in your Haydock store earlier today in Costa coffee  she purchased a bottle of pop in there too. As she went to pick up a pasta from the front of the store before leaving she placed the bottle in her bag  so not to confuse the goods. A member of staff witnessed this and alerted security which I completely understand.  The problem arises however when she had purchased her items and stands at the front of the store whilst waiting for a friend. At this point the member of staff starts to shout at her in front of many shoppers entering the store  accusing her of stealing the bottle of pop.   This is extremely belittling and embarrassing to my wife considering this is our local store where we know many people. She explained she had purchased it from Costa coffee and offered for the staff member or security guard to accompany her to prove it from the cashier  which was declined. The member of staff walked away without even apologising.  There s a few issues here  to accuse a customer at the front of a busy store is appalling  I believe she could have asked her to step out of the way and ask her about the item but to even do this without checking the CCTV first and gaining hard evidence is sickening! Can you even imagine the embarrassment of being called a thief in public?   Then to not even apologize properly and just walk away in my eyes is appalling customer service. As for the security guard  how can he back up a staff member without seeing the incident in question  even if it was a theft surely it s not a theft until the item has exited the store which it hadn t.  Maybe you need to brief your staff on customer service techniques in this store as its clearly lacking from some members of staff.   A complaint was put in to the help desk but I m hoping this will be followed up accordingly and not just brushed under the rug.					2016-02-04T14:29:41+0000	1454596181	2016-02-04 15:29:41	1	10	1	0	11	10	3	7	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Soon after  I assume  my mother  who was shopping with her husband  slipped on the sauce causing her to fly into the air and land heavily. Fortunately  the glass from the bottle had been moved to a shelf as this may have led to far more serious injuries. The employee on the fishmongers called to report it and my mother was asked for some details and was told someone would be in touch. We are now at Thursday and still no contact. She has been unable to continue with her usual day-to-day activities and has been advised it is likely that her coccyx will be painful for some time. I get married in 2 weeks in Cornwall and  I am hoping that she will be able to travel the 3.5 hours down the motorway. We have taken photographs of her injuries. I am disgusted at the attitude and incomprehensible lack of acknowledgement from your store in Redditch and expect this to be taken seriously. I am furious and expect this to be responded to immediately. I would also like copies of the CCTV from Saturday showing when it had been dropped and when my mother fell as I feel that Tesco have been extremely negligent through poor housekeeping. I am willing to pay so that the tape may be edited to preserve the identify of others. I look forward to hearing from you forthwith					2016-02-04T14:14:41+0000	1454595281	2016-02-04 15:14:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I took it today to your Newtownbreda store where  because I had no receipt  I was given a gift card rather than a refund or replacement. The gift card won t be active for 24 hours  so I had to buy a replacement rather than have to go back again on one errand to get another one with the gift card. When I got the new one home  it has the same model number as the ones you have recalled and a KDJ plug on it!! Surely you should have removed these from your shelves?? Also  on reading you recall notice - I was surely entitled to a refund rather than a gift card for the amount?					2016-02-04T11:37:57+0000	1454585877	2016-02-04 12:37:57	2	8	2	0	10	8	6	2	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Brilliant! However they are taking away Sat night premium  bank holiday extra pay  no days in lieu and night shift pay now starts at midnight and finishes at 0600. Which means my mum now gets paid day shift pay from 2230-midnight and then from 0600-0700. So that 3 1/2 % payrise has now turned into my mum being over £70-100 worse off. Great payrise.

Why? It s very well known through the media and looking at stock market prices  that a barrel of crude is continuing to spiral downward in price. So why does my local Tesco garage find the need to increase its price? It makes no sense  other than greed. There are other Tesco garage s nearby  that are still selling at the lower price.  Why does Tesco Twickenham find it necessary to charge more than any other Tesco in the locality other Tesco stores?I cannot find any justifiable reason.  Do the honourable thing and lower the current price.  I am sure my local trading standards office would be equally interested too.					2016-02-03T23:31:46+0000	1454542306	2016-02-04 00:31:46	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My colleges don t have any experience in stacking shelfs but some of us do have experience in looking after the elderly (which I think would come in very handy working for Tesco) as all ages go in and out of Tesco s so I would not only would myself and my colleges be a good shoulder to cry on for the customers but we also have qualified nurses to that if any thing was to happen to one of your customers there will always be a nurse stacking shelfs ready waiting to help that customer.   I hope I get a reply soon thank you for listening me and my 30 odd colleges will be waiting in anticipation for   Your reply.

How can you expect customer loyalty if you can t treat your suppliers in an honest and open manner.  We have been customers for over 30 years  but are very disillusioned with your tactics.  Play fair  treat british farmers with respect and pay a fair price whether it be a wonky carrot or a pint of milk  If british farming goes  all goods will have to be imported  and then the suppliers can charge what price they wish  look at the long picture  not your short term profit.

I live in Scotland and had to find out about the alert through an English friend commenting on an English tabloids status. Disgusting! Then when I researched online there is no mention from tesco...as at 18.48 about any recall although there was on about 5 or 6 English newspaper sites! I had to call my local tesco in wishaw to ask and explained my disappointment and she INSISTED that under NO circumstances is the slow cooker used!!!! Seriously? Enraged!

After purchasing a sofa and armchair and paying cash for them in store  they were delivered. However  the armchair was not as it should be and after much messaging and a visit to re stuff the said item  it was decided that you would collect the chair and give me a full refund. Great  a full refund  but I will not receive this until 7/10 working days after collection of the chair.?. I m sure that any item I purchased from your store would have to be paid for on collection or before delivery  not 7/10 days afterwards. Why oh why do I have to wait that long for a refund back onto my debit card. Have to say I m very  very disappointed. I need to purchase another chair  but need to use the refunded money for this!!!					2016-02-03T18:39:22+0000	1454524762	2016-02-03 19:39:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Prior to the visit her car was virtually immaculate but now has streaks of what looks like melted lacquer on it. She complained to the guys who washed it but they refused to accept any responsibility for it and told her that she should just pay to get the work sorted at a body shop. It s clear to me that they used a chemical when they washed it that was too aggressive and that has caused the damage and I m holding tesco responsible for this damage.   Who do I need to talk to to get this resolved. Thanks.					2016-02-03T18:27:30+0000	1454524050	2016-02-03 19:27:30	3	48	3	1	52	48	2	46	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just popped to your Yate branch for a few things  (including the new Stick Man DVD!). Everything was great  but just wanted to mention that it might not be a good idea for you to put grapes out on the free fruit for our little uns table. It is such a great idea and my daughter asked for some strawberries but I did have to stop her just popping a grape in her mouth. It was probably a case of the employee who puts the fruit out not realising how much of a choking hazard they are unless cut longways (or even better into 4) but all it takes is a little one to run up to the table and eating one before their grown-up can tell them not to for there to be a disaster. There was no one there for me to tell and a long queue at customer services so I gave taken this approach to draw your attention to it and also (hopefully) spreading awareness.					2016-02-03T16:57:58+0000	1454518678	2016-02-03 17:57:58	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to pass on what a great friendly store manager you have at this store. I had my tired  grumpy and grizzling 2 year old plus my 1 year old with me. I happened to notice my 1 year old had dropped his dummy and commented on it to my children. As I did this I hadn t noticed two staff members passing. One of which was your manager. He stopped and offered to help find my 1 year olds dummy. Asked where I had been and asked a colleague to look for it. Whilst the colleague looked for our lost dummy the store manager spoke to my grizzling 2 year old. He asked if he would like a strawberry  asked me if he could give the boys some fruit and opened a trio punnet of strawberries  raspberries and blueberries and gave them to my 2 year old to share with his brother. Totally unexpected but so much appreciated. I can t thank your manager enough for such lovely and kind customer service. Above and beyond what you would expect. Thanks again from a tired mummy of two boys. Oh and the dummy was found 😊 thanks again.					2016-02-03T16:57:55+0000	1454518675	2016-02-03 17:57:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Hope someone can help me!!! Dear Mr Lewis   I am disappointed with the way your colleagues have dealt with the cable outages in the Stafford area and I write on behalf of my mother-in-law who has now been without her landline and internet since the 14th January.  My husband called Tesco on the 15th January as the fault was not noticed until the evening of the 14th.  He had performed the necessary checks to see if it was indeed an internal fault or a fault with the handset before calling.  My husband was asked three times if he had performed these checks and then the line disconnected.  We have called Tesco every day or so for updates on this issue.  All of your customer service agents were pleasant and polite but were unable to help.  Most offers of a callback were actioned. My husband is still  however  waiting for a callback from Friday.  Two weeks later my husband called only to be asked if he had paid the bill!  The agent was then asked to check the records to which he replied that it was a problem with the  exchange  and then  was an outage issue .  It has been reported in our local press that BT Openreach were working in a nearby area of Stafford due to an outage and we could ask our providers to provide a diversion from the landline to an alternative number.  My husband requested this and this is the call we have not received.  To date we have not received a definitive timescale of when the situation can be resolved.  I would appreciate if you could look into this for both ourselves and my mother in law.					2016-02-03T13:25:57+0000	1454505957	2016-02-03 14:25:57	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not even a phone call to apologise or explain when they actually would show up. So I called them this morning and was told they would arrive today. They did. I opened the front door to find the delivery guy had leant two large and extremely heavy boxes up against the house. He shoved a clipboard under my nose and asked me to sign  so I did and then I stepped back and asked them to pop them just inside the door. He said No! I am 32 weeks pregnant (something the big bump makes extremely obvious) and I said to him that I clearly couldn t lift them. He told me that his company policy meant he wasn t allowed to. I said I didn t see why he was allowed to carry them from the van to the front door  but not allowed to move them two feet into the house but all I got was a shrug. My mum then showed up and tried to move a box but it was obvious it was way too heavy for her and she couldn t even lift it. The guy just walked off. I called after him and asked if it was really his company policy because I would be phoning up to complain  to which I just got another shrug and told to go ahead. Ten muntes later when my mum and I had managed to get the boxes inside we discovered that the side of the box that had conveniently been left up against a wall  so that it couldn t be seen  had a tear all down one side so  for all I know half the stuff inside is missing or damaged. A call to Tesco direct informed me that they use  Furniture-to-go  as their  approved partner . I m hoping to find out if it really is company policy not to bring boxes inside a house and to be honest  even if it is  I think it s disgusting when a young man probably in his 20 s would rather watch a pregnant woman and her mum struggle  then step in and offer even the slightest help.					2016-02-03T13:19:52+0000	1454505592	2016-02-03 14:19:52	2	5	2	0	7	3	3	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tonight I saw one of your staff members dutifully scooping armfuls of baked goods into a white bin liner. Although the wheat-based products  final destination was not explicit  one can only imagine that  as I type  they are now sitting wedged in a giant food bin  alongside other edible (but not shelf-worthy) products.   I suppose my first question is: when will this madness end?  Although I can appreciate the complexities involved in balancing a supply and demand nightmare  I remain unconvinced that people should go hungry when this waste is so ubiquitous and large-scale.   France changed to accommodate this paradox. My next question is: why can t you use your enormous corporate weight to spear-head a similar concept in Britain?					2016-02-02T22:05:54+0000	1454450754	2016-02-02 23:05:54	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	8	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also why are the toilets in this store always disgusting? I hate taking my four year old into them. I have noticed a lot of other tesco s giving free fruit to kids but the aviemore one hasn t taken this great pr opportunity up. As someone who can t eat bread thanks so much aviemore store for keeping your normal and gluten free bread side by side. I also love how I do my bit for the planet and save my wee 5p s only for the staff in this store to treat you like a thief and stand up close to you at the till looking into your bags and what your putting into your bags. Can safely say I won t be using this store again. So sit back tesco pour yourself a glass of wine and ponder on why your profits are so low and you can t seem to get the great British public out of aldis......

We had the receipt and went to take them back today for a refund as they were faulty  only to be so embarrassed at customers services as she refused to give a refund due to the slippers not having a label inside (for some long number) we didn t make the slippers so this is our fault  she called for the manager who said its against the law to give a refund and we could pick some new slippers (which we didn t want) so she went looking on the shelfs for the same slippers to get the code of the tesco tag  we finally got given a refund. Personally I find this ridiculous and embarrassing as this wasn t our fault they were faulty. I m wanting to know what can be done please because we aren t happy with how we were treat.					2016-02-02T19:45:13+0000	1454442313	2016-02-02 20:45:13	0	6	0	0	6	5	3	2	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was able to exchange it for another coat  choosing one from the store.  I haven t even worn the new coat yet and when I took it out of the bag upon getting home  I discovered a popper has fallen off.  I now need to make another trip to Tesco to sort that out.  I m tempted this time to go for a full refund rather than an exchange as it seems the quality of your coats is somewhat poor.					2016-02-02T19:22:36+0000	1454440956	2016-02-02 20:22:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This store is on a large multi-shop site and there are currently no charging points at all here.  People come from miles around and there are loads of electric vehicles around here as Nissan have their plant in Sunderland.  And make them not too close to the store entrance so that people in non-electric vehicles aren t tempted to park in them!					2016-02-02T17:03:42+0000	1454432622	2016-02-02 18:03:42	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For once when I received my price guarantee e-mail I thought I d check. Out of my whole shop only 4 things were compared against other shops  so I went online to check Asda etc to see if they sell the other products I bought which they do some cheaper so i called tesco and I ve been told only branded items are compared now.. as I ve paid for a delivery service I should have been written to and given the option to cancel so i can move to a supermarket that compares my whole shop not the way to rum a company and keep customers  ...					2016-02-02T16:14:01+0000	1454429641	2016-02-02 17:14:01	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I slipped on some frozen peas which had been spilled in the frozen veg aisle and hurt my knee and legs quite badly.    My details were taken at the time  which I naively thought was to contact me later to check how I was once I had been seen by a Doctor.  I now realise they were only taken as a legal requirement to complete your accident report.  I am so disappointed that  Every little helps  really doesn t mean much at all when it comes to customer accidents.  A phone call would have taken all of 5 minutes.					2016-02-02T15:19:50+0000	1454426390	2016-02-02 16:19:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We seem to be having problems charging and holding charge. it was fully charged sat night  green light on. Went to bed  he asked to use it about 7am sun morning and battery flat! Tonight I ve plugged the charger in and the red light hasn t even come on! Are you able to help with this? It already went for repair  in August 2015 for repair as there was something wrong with the hard drive.  Also he wants to add some new games to it but it keeps saying not enough external Storage so he s been deleting old games he s not bothered about but still won t let him put new games on. My youngest son received a hudl2 this Christmas  bought in October 2015 and this seems to struggle holding charge also.

This is my local Tesco store and I m appalled.  Please can you investigation this matter?   Ive come home from work today to find my dad very upset and agitated which was heart breaking for me. ..... My dad a 76 year old man with terminal cancer just out of hospital was stopped and by the security guard in an informal manner in front of staff and shoppers and humiliated to the point that he was so upset and embarrassed that he tipped the trolley up and left the shop very upset and humiliated. I phone the manager of TESCO STORE DINNINGTON to find her customer service attitude was beyond belief and she hung the phone up on me !!!!!! What does this tell you ???? I then get several texts and phone calls from friends and family telling me that my dad was the talk of the shop all afternoon by staff and to find out that the security guard had been bragging about this incident.... I am appalled at this incident and the customer service that s been received and I will be taking this matter further believe me.... And just to let you no MR SECURITY GUARD we no your name. .....

Having been ordering from you for over a year and being 24 I have never once been asked for id to take in the shopping. Yet today as there were two delivery drivers (one obviously training the other one) he decided he would ask for id as apparently I didn t even look 18. He shone the torch at me as though I was committing some kind of crime! When I couldn t find my passport at such short notice but that my partner would be home any second he said he would wait in the garden. Sure enough my partner arrives and he doesn t even ask him for id and is as nice as can be. When I question why he has asked me his only reply was I don t look 18 and I could have sharps cigarettes etc in the shopping( I don t because you have the list of what I ve ordered) had I been ordering alcohol etc I would understand. I was made to feel completely stupid through the whole order. well done tesco you ve just lost a long term customer because of this ridiculous rule					2016-02-01T22:00:52+0000	1454364052	2016-02-01 23:00:52	0	4	0	0	4	4	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well I have to say that will definitely not be happening. I purchased my first Hudl in September  when it arrived it had no charger plug with it and I telephoned Customer Service. Another Hudl was delivered the next day and I handed the one with no charger back to the DPD delivery driver.  I then purchased two more Hudls over the next fortnight and the three were unused until Christmas Day.   On Boxing Day my daughter came to me with her Hudl and told me it was freezing. I reset the Hudl to Factory settings but over the next few days it happened more and more. It was getting to the point that I was turning it on and it was freezing on the lock screen. I rang up Tesco Customer Service and was told I would be refunded the money if I sent the Hudl back. I did and I was refunded the full amount back to my card and my clubcard points removed for this item.  On Friday my daughter came to me to tell me that her Hudl was freezing when she turned it on it went to Hudl screen  then lock screen  then turned itself off and back on again. It continually done this in a loop until I pressed the reset button. I spoke to Tesco Direct and then Hudl Tech Support who advised me that as I was out of date for a replacement or refund I would have to send it back to Tesco for repair and it was picked up today.  Then yesterday my son is playing on the third Hudl and lo and behold the exact same thing as was happening to the first Hudl starts happening to his. AGAIN I ring Tesco Customer Service who put me through to Hudl support. I was spoken to by a very rude member of your staff who stated that this would be my or my kids fault as it would be an issue with an app or software and not a hardware problem. I listened and done everything he asked including a full factory reset and adding an anti virus and doing a full scan.  The Hudl worked for about an hour and then AGAIN it froze. I telephoned the tech team AGAIN to be told I would have to wait until WEDNESDAY to have this picked up and up to 10 working days for repair.  I now have 3 children  2 without their Hudls that they only received 5 weeks ago! I m fully aware I purchased them before this but that was solely to be organised for Christmas!  I also ordered before Christmas  with my Clubcard Boost points  3 pairs of Headphones for my children  which I am STILL waiting on being delivered!! I have called and been told they are with DPD  I have waited in on 3 separate occasions for them not to arrive and they are still not here. They are only under Dispatched on my order and for 5 weeks when my children COULD play on their Hudls they ve not had earphones that I ordered for them!!  I called customer service to ask to be put through to a complaints department  I was then transferred back to tech support for Hudl who gave me another number to call. I called that and was told that I would have to ring the main office in England.  I have spent the best part of 2 and a half hours on the phone to your staff and I have not been able to get an answer as to why I have been sold 3 separate Hudls that simply don t work. If I had bought these from another computer shop I would be taking this to Trading Standards. Nowhere on your advertisement for them did it state that you would get between 2 - 5 weeks use before they break!!  You will see I have spent a lot of money at Tesco Direct and I m sad to say I will not be ordering from you again. This is appalling that I am having to wait 2 weeks for my kids to play with their Hudls and even then when I get them back how long will they work for before I am back in this cycle again??  I am not happy with the experience I have had at all with Tesco Direct and especially regarding the Hudl. I will be making sure I tell as many people as I can not to buy them.  I have already private messaged this to you but why you are selling Hudls that are obviously not up to standard. If one of the 3 Hudls I purchased had gone faulty I would understand..... but all 3!!!!!  Very Unhappy Customer!					2016-02-01T21:02:22+0000	1454360542	2016-02-01 22:02:22	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Most of it was good for a low calorie meal  apart from the egg which was harder than it should have been for scrambled egg and chewy. I also saw on the packaging that it was not suitable for freezing. Why? Other brands of sweet & Sour Chicken can be frozen and eggs can be frozen too (e.g. quiche).

I m literally gobsmacked at what I witnessed earlier while doing my shopping with my two young children. An innocent boy being run up to by the day time manager who got in his face and then tried to head butt him for no reason is disgraceful. An argument had happened in the store 2 mins previously and this boy wasn t involved but the management didn t talk or find out what had happened and just ran in this young boys face trying to argue with him and head butt him  now coming from someone that s very high up in my own business I know for a fact that s not how you deal with any situation. After going to check on the young boy who was being pinned down by 4 fully grown men very violently I tried to find out the managers name who told me it was against data protection act to tell me. Yet this particular member of staff was wearing a name badge 😂. Now excuse me if I m wrong but asking a member of staffs name is not against data protection act and if this particular person had done everything to protocol he d have nothing to hide would he. My two young children witnessed this whole scene and I m actually disgusted with the way tesco staff dealt with this situation today. As a big company you should be ashamed of every member of staff involved in this incident in your Elmers end store today. I d like to make a formal complaint about this so please point me in the right direction to do so!

The other day I went to Tesco Extra at Westwood and could not find a space for Mother and Toddler. I waited in my car for a space to become available as I am not able to get my child in the car seat if I have to park in a smaller space.  When someone came out he was accompanied by 2 teenagers  I shouted out the window  Where is your child?  And he looked confused so said  This is a parent and child space!  So he then replied  These are my children  they are just older  Which was also a lie as the guy himself was perhaps only 5yrs older than the other 2 people...  At this point I got angry and I told him that people like him are a disgrace taking up a space designated to Parents and Children so they are able to use child seats safely and load/unload buggies and he simply shrugged and got in the car and left.   This seems to be the attitude from a lot of people who use the store as many times I have seen people without children or car seats just using the spaces because its near to the store.   Can I ask why is this not enforced? Im sure if I was to park in a disabled bay and not be disabled I would at the very least be told off for it however nobody seems to var about us Mums on own our with kids!  Perhaps the answer is to put the Parent and Child spaces further away from the store. The whole point is that we need extra space  we are quite capable of walking. Maybe people wouldnt see it as an easy option then.   I am just so annoyed that these bays exist yet the store does nothing to enforce the restrictions. It has in the past meant that I cannot shop in that store as I drive a large converted camper van and have no hope of getting my child out of her seat in a normal space.  I hope there is a solution to this problem so many of us face!					2016-02-01T17:18:31+0000	1454347111	2016-02-01 18:18:31	4	9	4	0	13	9	3	6	8	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Friday I phoned Tesco to let them know that I had stayed in waiting and it still had not arrived  they tried to track it with Hermes but told me they could not find it but would call me back later that day but they never did. Today we have called you again to be told it has gone missing and we cannot have it. Tesco won t offer me a similar replacement instead I have been offered my money back and a voucher but I am not happy. I have been looking forward to giving my son the toy he has been waiting for and now I will have to buy it elsewhere for double the price and wait even longer! I understand it is now out of stock but it wasn t when it was ordered as it was on its way to me  my parcel is still floating around out there somewhere but they won t make sure it is found and sent to me!					2016-02-01T14:12:50+0000	1454335970	2016-02-01 15:12:50	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is my point I cannot trust your pricing policy anymore which is why I mainly shop elsewhere Oh and by the way I took advantage of the usual price discount and bought in a few at another supermarket at £1 each - which is often the discounted price for almond milk - whether its Almond Breeze or Alpro etc.					2016-02-01T14:12:27+0000	1454335947	2016-02-01 15:12:27	0	10	0	0	10	10	1	9	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just returned from the Lewisham store  there are two pigeons who have accidentally flown into the front of the shop by the customer service booth.  As I was queueing up to use the service I heard the Manager tell her colleagues   we are waiting form Rent -O-Kill to come and shoot them !!!! May I remind you of the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Pigeons are very smart  that is why Bernard Skinner (the Father of the modern School of Behaviour Psychology) used them in his learning schedule studies. Is it beyond the ability of Tesco s Lewisham to fix the automatic door to the open position so that they can fly out  or even to  lure them out with bird seed? Would someone in senior Management please ensure that these two pigeons are given every opportunity to leave alive?					2016-02-01T14:05:49+0000	1454335549	2016-02-01 15:05:49	1	15	1	0	16	15	2	13	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Delivery saver customer or not  the c&c orders come in on a big load together not lots of individual deliveries. So explain to me why you now feel the need to charge for this service. Also you ve changed your tune on delivery saver customers. The original release of this charge stated that d-saver customers were exempt from the charge  now there is a £10 minimum.

The stitching has come undone on the top and be has two holes on the bottom. He is not the  typical boy  who s plays rough sports or anything. One pair of shoes usually last him the whole school year.  I ve never bought school shoes from tesco before  this is the first time. Is there anything I can do with no receipt?

After my sixth 12 hour night shift in a row I felt like I had enough energy to go and get my weekly shop. Went to Tesco Maryhill and spend about 20 minutes getting all the things I needed. Got to the checkout and was told I simply wasn t allowed to pay. You see my debit card has a slight dent in the chip and sometimes is not recognised in the chip and pin slot. I have NEVER had an issue with swiping it if the chip doesn t work  so long as I show the cashier ID. Except in Tesco that is. The  customer service  adviser point blank refused to even try. She told me it was against Tesco s policy  that they don t do swipe cards. So I ended up having to leave my shopping and walk out the store with people staring at me like I didn t have enough money to pay for my goods. I then came home and phoned the duty manager who was absolutely not capable in a manager position. A) She didn t know there was a policy on swiping cards. B) When she phoned back to explain the situation  she not only scoffed down the phone twice when I said I was frustrated and had never had any issues in any other shop  and C) Her entire vocabulary seemed to be made up of  aye    naw  and  sorry it s not tesco s policy . I would like to escalate this further to have either signs put up in the shop stating which methods of payment you do take and I would also like to have this policy confirmed by someone who takes this complaint seriously. Until I feel less like a piece of dirt who couldn t afford her shopping  I certainly won t be back in any of your stores.					2016-02-01T09:22:43+0000	1454318563	2016-02-01 10:22:43	0	8	0	0	8	7	4	3	17	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to your A127 Southend store to draw money out today (I know the machines aren t your responsibility) and the machines swallows my card! I then ask the lady next to me if she could send security out and I ll stop anyone else being inconvenienced by this and then another chap comes out the store saw me by the machine and says  I wouldn t use that one it just ate my card! . Security then comes along and tells me it s been playing up for 2 weeks and even took his card so I told him to take it out of service so it doesn t affect anyone else. Long and short of it I was in the car for a good 15-20 mins calling bank and having to put off my orders I was due to collect today and as I complete everything and drive out of the car park low and behold another person is using the machine!!! Why is it still in service!!! Disgusting you can let this continue!!!					2016-02-01T09:18:04+0000	1454318284	2016-02-01 10:18:04	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

DUNDEE SCOTLAND!  Well where do I start  Tesco in Dundee retail park at 4:50am... I normally purchase cigarettes from shops during day light hours but I found myself up all night and headed off to Tesco s Direct 24 hour store to get 3 packs to last me a few days as the weather is getting bad. I went in to the store to find no staff to sell cigarettes and asked a floor worker is there anyone who can serve me cigarettes  eventually a floor worker came over from the other end of the store who was busy packing sandwiches she asked what I required  I asked for my brand and they only had one packet. so I asked what other cigarettes they had and the assistant was quite rude and shut the door with these words exactly....   I am not allowed to show you or tell you what cigarettes we have in the secure case . ( How the bloody hell can you sell drink openly that kills people whilst under the influence which causes drunk people to do stupid things and drive drunk yet I have never heard of a cigarette smoker killing someone for smoking yet).  I replied that the law stipulates that they must have a list of brands available  she then got this piece of scrap paper with about fourteen scribbled brands  that were available on such a frigging small secure box  three of the brands near my selection of cigarettes were not stocked. Since they only had one packet of my brand available I declined to purchase anymore from Tesco s and I then told the assistant I will rather purchase my cigarettes from ASDA 24 hour store where manners and customer care exist which was another 2 miles away. so off I toddled to  ASDA   We now feel that Tesco s is playing crèche with adults  I am 45 years old and drive  have sex  and live within the terms of the law. We will never shop there again as this is not the only incident I found myself in and a lot of my friends have been treated rudely as well as badly.    VERY POOR CUSTOMER CARE .  NOW ABOUT THE SHOPLIFTING INCIDENT  It is an offence to stop even a real shoplifter before exiting a store as this then constitutes theft  yet they done this to us  read on!  Three years ago they stopped my wife and myself and accused my wife for shoplifting. the door security blocked us in and said they were informed by a customer that my wife had shoplifted and searched as well as checked all the items in the bag and receipt. We carry our own bags around with us in all stores throughout  different shops like anyone else  as I am a wheelchair user with health problems we place the items in the bag/s and have done so for years  a lot of people do the same yet they are never stopped. Once again they are forcing you to purchase bags  which is a tax and it is suppose to go to charity..... which one? Tesco s bank??? and so we have our own bags just like you the customers. We never really got an official apology  the so called manager was no way trained in public managerial relations  she was just a joke they sent to customer services to flog us off the complaint we had   they had stopped us before leaving the store via an exit point nor an apology from the stores security who was the true instigator of the incident and Tesco s blamed him saying he does not work for the store  then what was he doing in the security cam observation office??? which is at the rear of the store....... possibly eyeing the women out  having a nap  or just needing a rest on a chair with as monitor as he misses his sports channel dearly!  I have now decide to let other Tesco s shoppers view my complaints to let them really know why Tesco s are genuinely losing customers on a fast scale. Why Tesco s lied about their profits and the way they held their suppliers payments off to boost the profits margin up. Hope you all enjoy this sad stated story of true facts.  I think it is time for the press to get the story.  SHAME ON YOU TESCO S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!					2016-02-01T06:42:28+0000	1454308948	2016-02-01 07:42:28	0	7	0	0	7	6	3	3	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
