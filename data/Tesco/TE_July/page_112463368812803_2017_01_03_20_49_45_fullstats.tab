She was quick to spot the new display you have set up on the end of the fruit and veg aisle; free fruit for kids whilst shopping!  She chose a beautiful looking apple out of the great selection of oranges  bananas and apples there was to offer.  She was amazing throughout the hour we were in there and even offered me a bite!  Thank you so much for this new offer Tesco!

I was eating an ice cream tonight and found several small bits of plastic within the ice cream. Obviously I noticed them and stopped eating  but if a small child was eating the ice cream then obviously this could cause a choking hazard. These particular ice creams were purchased in Tesco  but the same batch could be in a number of shops.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13920831_10154026350446107_1958130816745355780_n.jpg?oh=dbd39d85f9f29b13fb890b918b153d6d&oe=58EA6B47	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13920831_10154026350446107_1958130816745355780_n.jpg?oh=00b8bf12d720e70a8f723eb597b36055&oe=58DFC44A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154026350446107&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-31T21:06:22+0000	1469999182	2016-07-31 23:06:22	1	5	1	1	7	4	3	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I love them and was really excited to see they were on special the other night almost 50% off.. so I bought a couple of jars. I had went onto the Tesco online today and discovered you are no longer supplying them. Disappointed by this i went to my local Tesco in Bellshill. I put 7 jars in my trolly and while I was doing the rest of my shop  thought depending when they expire  I will just buy a few more so i have a supply until i can see where else to buy them. When I looked at the date i was horrified to see that the date said March 2016!! I checked a second jar which said Feb 2016!!! I searched all over the jar to make sure that i hadn’t missread  all the jars had similar dates. I went back to the shelf to check the others and they were all the same! I said to a member of staff  who didn’t seem bothered by it at all.   I’ve came home to check the dates of other jars i have had in the house and they are all the same expiry too!!! Now I am wondering how many jars since Feb/March have I ate without realising they were out of date! I did think they were a bit more salty than normal and this explains why! Maybe someone should be checking the dates more often on the shelves as its 5/6months past the date.					2016-07-31T20:51:17+0000	1469998277	2016-07-31 22:51:17	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

For at least the third time this week your customers have blocked the access road to Plais street and Glenthorne Road.  The drivers that are doing this are always in your store because we have to go in and shout for them.  So far this week they have prevented the undertakers accessing their premises.  Stopped carers attending medically at risk patients and prevented access for fire and ambulance.  You have no notices up advising people not to park in the access road.  No yellow lines reminding that parking should not happen there and no sign you are going to deal with it.  Does someone need to die before you deal with the issue???					2016-07-31T18:55:21+0000	1469991321	2016-07-31 20:55:21	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I suffered one of the  worst racism in my life from 4 staff members. I will do everything that actions takes in place. How dare that staff member asking only me if I bought for the plastic bag and other people did not ask? it is because I was the only black and she took the audacity and judgement and stereotyping black people of not paying for plastic bag. The security showed me more racism against black person even though he is black. The team leader and the manager  very horrible costumer service  they even do not know how to treat a pregnant costumer. I am ashamed of you. From today you are not going to have me as a costumer for good as you do not know how to treat costumer fairly. I prefer to go to Sainsbury which is near by and I never I was discriminated there.					2016-07-31T18:33:29+0000	1469990009	2016-07-31 20:33:29	0	13	0	0	13	13	1	12	18	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This could have seriously ended badly! Is this what passes as quality fresh groceries down at Tesco Headquarters?

I would like to say how fantastic your Bourne store staff were last week Saturday 23rd July. About 0930-1030 I popped in for some bits and pieces for a last minute bbq in Saturday morning and unfortunately you had no burger rolls available.   Two of your bakery staff offered to cook me some fresh for later that afternoon.  I returned at half four as requested to find 4 packets of rolls freshly cooked and put away in the bakery for me.   They were not planning on cooking any at the point I asked so went out of their way to do this for me.  Could you please pass my appreciation on to the men concerned but also to their manager  Regards Donna					2016-07-31T17:47:59+0000	1469987279	2016-07-31 19:47:59	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to say huge thank you to a lovely lady Amanda who works there . A month ago when I was there   my son fell head first while I was trying to pay for the things . Amanda rushed straight to him  comforted him and brought some frozen peas to put to his head. She packed my bags and stayed next to me to make  sure my son was OK.  I can t describe how much I owe to her.She is an amazing lady who does her job in excellent way!					2016-07-31T17:46:27+0000	1469987187	2016-07-31 19:46:27	41	9	46	0	55	9	8	1	18	0	41	5	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my boyfriend bought chicken and a sausage from the shelf that had been bagged and put there. We shared it for lunch and less that 2 hours later we both have vomiting and diarrhea. We have not eaten or drunk anything the same apart from the hot food we bought from your store at lunch so it is definitely that! I was shocked a few weeks ago when I bought raw  chicken  from you which was gone off when I opened it. You sent me a gift card with £2.76 to cover it.  Don t think I ll be shopping at tesco any more. Every thing seems to be off and bad quality now!					2016-07-31T15:01:13+0000	1469977273	2016-07-31 17:01:13	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He went above and beyond to keep my daughter happy and entertained while I packed my shopping. He turned a shopping trip which would of usually ended in an argument or tantrum into an enjoyable experience. He is a real asset to your company and deserves recognition for the great job he does.					2016-07-31T13:38:25+0000	1469972305	2016-07-31 15:38:25	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I left the store he was actually outside on his mobile!  Customers walked away leaving their now partly defrosted frozen items on the pharmacy counter.  Lots of older people worried as they were unable to pick up their prescriptions.  When pharmacist finally bothered turning up he offered no apology whatsoever.  To top it all off it s apparently a common problem with the pharmacy but I can t vouch for that having only used it once (today) and I won t be coming back.					2016-07-31T12:59:46+0000	1469969986	2016-07-31 14:59:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I think maybe she s not suited to the job if she s SO personally annoyed having to walk up 4 low rise steps!!

Unfortunately I didn t want to buy a £30 or £40 product so have only been able to buy one. Then had to pay for the privilege of having it sent to store to collect. I know products on offer are not guaranteed however it s disappointing that all products either at the same or lower price were out of stock and the only ones left were at least double the price!	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDeu2YAMSkghFwI&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirectuiassets%2FMerchandising%2FNonSeasonal%2Fen_GB%2Fbanners%2Fresponsive%2Fevents2016%2FSummersale2016_PDP_FeatureSpace.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQBcnmaUV1NI_CfQ	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAwQTVpO8z3Dt_x&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirectuiassets%2FMerchandising%2FNonSeasonal%2Fen_GB%2Fbanners%2Fresponsive%2Fevents2016%2FSummersale2016_PDP_FeatureSpace.jpg&_nc_hash=AQBoS8vopPoWrjn5	http://www.tesco.com/direct/nikwax-tech-wash-tx-direct-wash-in-waterproofing-2-x-1-litre/215-7604.prd?promoId=promo40380060&skuId=215-7604	tesco.com	2016-07-31T11:34:24+0000	1469964864	2016-07-31 13:34:24	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I do a fair amount of motorway driving and notice branded trucks that drive courteously (and those that don t!) and have to compliment Tesco on the standards of their drivers.   Recently I was in a pub car park and saw a car pull out  inappropriately  in front of a Tesco 40 footer.  Both vehicles went out of sight behind some trees and I grabbed my phone to call the emergency services as I could see no way the truck could stop  but he did  bless him.  Not even a bump :-)  The local delivery drivers  in my area  are just as good - polite and courteous to other road users.    Anyway  just wanted to let you know that people do notice. Thank you :-)					2016-07-31T08:34:43+0000	1469954083	2016-07-31 10:34:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately half way through our shop our scanner went off! My partner found a guy for us who told us to look out for him when we were finished and he would open up a till for us! Sure enough he came over when we got to the end and sorted us out! My partner had run off to get some cotton wool which we had forgot  I informed the guy (I m pretty sure his name was Adam) having just had a c-section I would have to wait for my partner to come back to follow him as couldn t push the pushchair and trolley and he kindly went above and beyond taking our trolley over and unpacking and even taking some time to have some banter with my toddler and putting a drinks bottle straight through so he could have it back and not go into toddler meltdown! It was very much appreciated 💙💗					2016-07-31T07:05:11+0000	1469948711	2016-07-31 09:05:11	5	6	5	0	11	6	4	2	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited the Blackburn Hill Street branch of your store and unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances  arrived at the store shortly before closing time. Luckily I only needed to purchase a few essential items. Upon arrival I was informed the store was closing in 10 minutes which was fine as that would give me ample time to grab a few essentials. Around the whole shop I was harassed by staff members following me around and telling me the store is closing soon. A few staff members also decided to beep the horns or their forklifts at me numerous times  which I found extremely intimidating in an attempt to force me leave the store. Other customers were still shopping in the store but staff members were happy to help them  scanning their items and not rushing them along. I found the whole experience disgustingly rude. I would not expect this from Tesco. I will not be shopping with Tesco again. In the future I will drive the extra 4 minutes to Asda where I will treated like a human  with respect!					2016-07-30T23:59:46+0000	1469923186	2016-07-31 01:59:46	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our 18 month old was randomly sick down himself  our food and the shop floor but you were really helpful  offering us clean clothes and replacement items of food and cleaning up for us. You never think about that situation occurring and my poor wife was stood there trying to keep calm but you made her feel completely at ease and you went well beyond the call of duty to help us. You re both a great credit to the store and Tesco should use you as examples of great customer service. Thank you both so much.					2016-07-30T20:46:33+0000	1469911593	2016-07-30 22:46:33	133	12	140	7	159	12	10	2	22	0	132	6	1	0	0	0	0

Just done a quick shop tesco  paid at the self service with a contactless card  card machine said card approved but the till didn t register it and then froze. Cashier wasn t sure what was wrong with the self service machine so she rescanned the items on a different till and again paid with contactless. Just concerned that I might have paid twice  cashier didn t seem that confident that it wouldn t charge twice. If I has what do I need to do to get a refund?					2016-07-30T20:06:12+0000	1469909172	2016-07-30 22:06:12	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why on earth do you put a massive indentation in the polystyrene plate? To make it appear as though there is more filling than there actually is on the pizza? Stupid.

We popped in and bought serval items from your shop & you can only imagine the over whelmed delight when  after two month of traveling we came across Robinson s juice.  In our haste we bought three bottles.  Later that night we settled down for the night  popped open our juice to then sadly notice that they where all out of date  two whole months......  Although we still drank and thoroughly enjoyed our stale juice  we felt it was only far to make you aware that your Hungary branches are letting the team down.......   Although not completely letting you down  as we did get chased across the carpark by your security guard  in pursuit of one of your wheelie baskets  and for that we respect him for taking his job so seriously.

We do however have one complement......   You have not been completely letting down  as we did get chased across the carpark by your security guard  in pursuit of one of your wheelie baskets  and for that we respect him for taking his job so seriously.

When unwrapping it to cook I found a finger nail complete with nail polish on the topping. I m absolutely disgusted as it probably means that the person making the pizza wasn t wearing gloves either!! The worst thing is my five year old was looking forward to it as his special treat night and now I have to go out again to buy another pizza for him. Not impressed!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13873114_10154412788114169_7546686868684681813_n.jpg?oh=74d27bc31b775599e2718c7a72d2a66d&oe=5922540D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13873114_10154412788114169_7546686868684681813_n.jpg?oh=5c6b6b27d27b0e7d61287b04beb8787a&oe=58E47500	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154412788114169&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-30T18:27:33+0000	1469903253	2016-07-30 20:27:33	1	9	9	0	18	7	5	2	2	0	1	0	3	0	0	4	0

I m fed up with eating grapes......the only things that are not rock hard  don t give me that rubbish it s ripen at home....I want to eat it today  tomorrow with my breakfast not next week  anyway by then it s gone off inside. The other time even the bananas were bright green. I went in this afternoon....yeh! Fruit at 49p  you could hit them all with a sledge hammer  throw them at anything and they won t give. If Lidl can have nice edible fruit why can t you. I then think I will do my other shopping whilst I m here... The supervisor said he would have to speak to the supplier...that did a lot of good didn t it! I know you can t supply really soft fruit but give us a break!!! 😡					2016-07-30T17:52:18+0000	1469901138	2016-07-30 19:52:18	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sell by date for tomorrow. Don t but fresh fruit from Tesco s. You don t know how old it is and the fictitious farms give a sense that the fruit is from this country whereas it may be from anywhere in the world.  What a great con. Going to take them back tomorrow and would hope for some apology and refund!!  Really disappointed with Tesco.					2016-07-30T17:40:49+0000	1469900449	2016-07-30 19:40:49	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You only have to read the complaint and decide who to approach. Shopped in the store. Bring the problem to the staff inside the store? Nope. I thought not. Of course you do. Faulty goods to those responsible for the delivery etc. So simple if we used our common sense. Then frustration would be short lived.					2016-07-30T17:12:26+0000	1469898746	2016-07-30 19:12:26	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Visited your Cleethorpes store to buy a bbq. Charcoal kettle bbq was on display with NO price tag. So I checked the website and it came up at £25.00 once I d got to the checkout the register showed £50.00???!!! How can you double the price for if you purchase via click and collect? How much profit are you making on these? You ll make profit selling it at £25 but If in store you have to pay double??? And click and collect is in the same store so basically I d have to wait 24hour for the bbq to be transferred floors.  Spoke to customer service and got no real explanation had to go to a garden centre and a few other shops to find a bbq that wouldn t dent our holiday budget too much.  Every little helps.....  yeah right you re the same company online & in store it s disgusting how you can price it up double AND not even let me have it at the online price because you d not displayed the price.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13891795_10210069430513978_338546129869359838_n.jpg?oh=47f5ff9f625325c19e0e4cae8268ec50&oe=58F01522	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13891795_10210069430513978_338546129869359838_n.jpg?oh=873bd25afa827c4c21a0d2661c58827e&oe=58E0BF37	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210069430513978&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-30T15:25:09+0000	1469892309	2016-07-30 17:25:09	1	12	2	0	14	11	6	5	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Not only did I leave feeling embarrassed and humiliated  I also felt like a naughty school child in the playground!   On entering the store today with my partner  I went to get some alcohol as we was going out tonight  but my partner didn t feel well so I said go and get in the car and ill pay for the stuff. So at the self checkout I presented my ID  to be told that it looks dark? Surly the DVLA wouldn t allow me a driving licence if my picture was too dark? Not only that the security guard then came over and asked my where my partner had gone  and that he d been watching us walk around the store? and because he walked a completely different way to me it look suspicious. He also asked if he ID which I stated he left at home because he wasn t buying the alcohol it was myself. All this was done while people were watching  you can see now why I felt humiliated. Why should I have to justify myself to someone who is suppose to speak to you in a nice manor? I think you need to look at the staff you are hiring and the way they are speaking to customers because I wont be attending that store again after the way I was spoken to and the way I was made to feel just because my partner was ill and wanted to sit in the car.					2016-07-30T14:59:53+0000	1469890793	2016-07-30 16:59:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 4 year old daughter slipped and banged her head on the hard tiled floor as the store staff had failed to ensure that the water from the pipe that was leaking in the entrance to the store was cleaned up and marked with appropriate signage. We had to leave the store without actually getting any shopping so we could get my daughter home to make sure she was ok.  The pipe in the entrance way has a constant drip  which was being caught in 2 buckets. 2 yellow warning signs were positioned behind the buckets. However  in front of the bucket was a large puddle of water. This is where my daughter slipped and banged her head. The store staff came over however it took a good 10 minutes for the water to be cleaned up  and even longer for the First Aider to arrive check my daughters head. The whole area should have been cordoned off with signs on both sides of the buckets to ensure that it was clear to everyone. My 4 year old doesn’t yet read  and didn’t know that the warning signs on the other side of the bucket would mean there was danger where she was walking.  We were told that a full investigation would take place to find out what had caused the leak  and to make sure that it is fixed. I live locally to Bedworth Tesco  and come into the store as a loyal customer at least once or twice a week  and can assure you that this leak has been a feature of the store for some months. There are often buckets on the floor catching the drips and the pipe that is leaking is all brown from where it has been leaking for some time. So to be told that a ‘full investigation’ would take place in order to find out ‘how it happened’ is a massive insult. This should have been looked into and fixed as soon as it started leaking  as it is a huge safety hazard.   The store staff gave my daughter a new dress as her own dress was soaking wet  and a drink and an apology  however that simply isn’t good enough. I’d like to know how you aim to rectify the issue in store  and make amends for the injury caused to my 4 year old please  as I don’t feel as though this incident has been dealt with seriously enough.					2016-07-30T13:54:27+0000	1469886867	2016-07-30 15:54:27	2	10	9	1	20	10	7	3	0	0	2	0	0	0	3	4	0

I haven t got the time or inclination to walk round looking for something that is in a different place. It s not necessary and is done to make sure shoppers have to look at everything as they go round. Today it s the baking items  sugar etc that have been moved  so it was back and forth from one aisle to the next. The drinks  beers etc are always in the same place so why move foodstuff round. There were lots of people moaning this morning about it. Feel tempted to start shopping in Sainsburys at least they don t change their shelves round on a regular basis.					2016-07-30T12:15:18+0000	1469880918	2016-07-30 14:15:18	2	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The magazine (showing the tv/radio/ programmes for the whole week) was included in the Daily Mail but not the Daily Express. I complained to a member of staff about this stating that it has happened on several occasions and it s not fair to all other customers who want/wanted/ to buy the newspaper. I was thinking about everybody else and not just myself. All the other staff at all the other stores should be made aware of this to avoid complaints being made. Please check that the magazine is inside the newspaper before purchase. Thank you.					2016-07-30T11:02:00+0000	1469876520	2016-07-30 13:02:00	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did a click n collect order from Tescos. In mynorder  I ordered red seedless grapes and green seedless grapes because my grandchildren were coming today and they love grapes. But  yet again  something I ordered  that was there when I checked my basket before paying - was not even on the list when the order was done. This is not the first time this has happened  but Tescos says that it doesn t happen. ... But it does. And this is more than once that its happened. So this means that after placing my order  I  have to check every item on my email order to see if anything is missing.   NOW...FOR THE PHOTOS   This is supposed to be FRESH ROOT GINGER.  Yeah  my a**e. This was the piece of mouldy shriveled FRESH ginger that someone actually picked out for me. Disgusting. I phoned up. I could have a refund. And then after pointing out that this should not happen  I could have a goodwill gesture a voucher for £5   for my next online shop.  GOODWILL GESTURE? - this should NOT have happened. A goodwill gesture should not be necessary if people do their jobs properly. If I had all the items I ordered and if they were fresh as I expected  then a Goodwill gesture should not be needed.  But goodwill or not.... I am fuming. Disgusted.

When I turn it on I have to wait like 3 minutes to even change the channel or anything on it. Went in the store and spoke to customer service  their attitude was disgusting and speaking to me.  Then explaining I need the receipt and the box. To what I replied yes I have all that and they kept repeating with a attude. I know why though... I get it alot being profiled and it s illegal.  If I turned up in my work gear  I doubt they would of acted like that.					2016-07-30T09:25:04+0000	1469870704	2016-07-30 11:25:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am very disappointed and angry at this. Every other supermarket doesn t charge. I was ordering from you as some things were cheaper but with the £2 charge they are not. I will be shopping somewhere else for their uniforms now.					2016-07-30T09:11:18+0000	1469869878	2016-07-30 11:11:18	0	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

To my eye there are still way too many littering our roads & countrysides. I wrote to a number of large supermarkets recently asking them to consider paper bags (at least they degrade a bit quicker) SAINBURYS were the least open to this idea  saying it wasn t practical!!! Tell that to most American supermarkets. MORRISONS didn t reply! TESCO - said great idea & sent me a £10 voucher. ASDA also thought it a good idea. I even suggested they offset costs and get their marketing to offer paper bags as advertising space to major suppliers - off setting a charge to customers! Nice to see that it s been ignored! Still if they know that we ll buy these fancy hessian bags (I m a bit of a sucker for these) & these supermarkets can make a profit from our efforts to be environmentally friendly  then they ll be happy anyway! Simply BAN plastic bags - I just hope supermarkets read this? Just one of my pet hates...					2016-07-30T07:50:31+0000	1469865031	2016-07-30 09:50:31	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I nipped in to buy a cheap [ay as you go phone to use whilst my current phone gets fixed but apparently I cannot buy a phone in your store after 8pm?....but I can get fags and alchohol at that time. Personally I find this really annoying I may have only been after a £15 phone which won t make Tesco much profit but i m sure i m not the only person who needs your phone services after 8pm?? I was told by the lady at the desk that if I go to Asda they will be willing serve me for a phone........................so really I was being told that Asda would make the effort to help me but Tesco s staff are not able to go up an escalator to get me a phone from upstairs. Feeling let down by a shop that has been used by me and my family for the last 30 odd years!					2016-07-29T22:26:20+0000	1469831180	2016-07-30 00:26:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were so grateful to arrive and find that the driver had let himself in  unpacked the shopping into the fridge and left us a note telling us to have a good holiday!

May I add both over 70 years old who spend easily 5/6 days a week if not everyday shopping and using tesco as a supermarket. Speaking on behalf of them I think it s disgraceful that they have been penalised due to be elderly and not quite understanding the exact time scale they may be allowed. They must spend a couple of hours a day in tesco cafe enjoying a cup of coffee from Costa  which also the cafe staff can confirm what  regular  customers my grandparents are as they know they order before they even walk in and kindly bring the hot drinks over to their table. Not once have they been confronted to say that they may run over their allowed period in the car park also baring in mind don t think it would be suitable to say they would be able to run over to the car to rush out also - however if my elderly grandparents held a disabled badge they would be allowed extra time. I think this is extremely hurtful to know my poor   Nan and grandad can now not enjoy a relaxing break in tesco cafe due to the pressure of a timescale in a car park which has ample free spaces everyday! From now on i will defiantly show them some new cafes to be enjoying there free time in!!!					2016-07-29T21:14:24+0000	1469826864	2016-07-29 23:14:24	0	9	0	0	9	9	5	4	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got a gorgeous pair of shorts for Amaani but I also come out of Tesco with 4 absolutely stunning bows!!😍 .. The lady from Bows Before Bros had scattered Bows around Tesco for Little Princesses to find!! How lovely is that!! She made these bows herself and instead of making money from them  she just gave them away to make our little girls smile!! How lovely!! Just want to say a massive Thank You to the amazing woman behind  Bows Before Bros  who works so so hard to make perfect bows for our Princesses! You really are a lovely woman and should be recognised for your kindness and hard work!

I then am promised to have delivered to my home with cost covered on a day that i choose (at this point i think great finally someone being efficient) to find delivery has not arrived.  To find there was a problem/delay and it did not make it to Yodel (only find this out by calling and having to go through the whole situation yet again) and they did not inform me that my delivery will not be coming once they found out there was a problem.  i am then promised to be contacted at 7.45pm tonight to inform me if the delivery was still ongoing and if it made it to Yodel yet so i knew whether i needed to arrange for a refund and get an alternative tomorrow (needed Monday which why original collect date was a 7 days ago).  Not surprisingly for the third time i receive no contact. very angry (but polite) email sent to customer services (in regards to Tesco Direct  not groceries deliveries as that part is actually really good).  fully intend to put in a formal complaint once i find the procedure to follow.  Am out money  no delivery  having to pay more money to replace.  Not a happy customer.					2016-07-29T19:54:40+0000	1469822080	2016-07-29 21:54:40	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were going to buy the Dine in for 2 for £10 but when it came to choosing a dessert there was only one choice left; lime and coconut... unfortunately I m allergic to coconut. We asked a member of staff if they had anymore  he checked in the back to see if there were any in stock but he said there weren t. We then asked a supervisor if we could choose another £3 dessert to have in the deal but she didn t seem interested in helping at all and completely dismissed it. It was such bad customer service. So what happens later on this evening when the remaining 2 coconut desserts have sold out?! I used to work in a Cooperative food store and we would always offer an alternative  good customer service goes a long way.					2016-07-29T18:54:36+0000	1469818476	2016-07-29 20:54:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wanted to try an item on so went to go into the changing rooms where I was stopped by a member of staff and told I couldn t take the trolley in  I said well I cannot leave my children out here unattended so I m taking them in with me in the trolley or it s impossible for me to try the item on. The member of staff then got very rude with me and was very abrupt to the point even my 8 year old picked up on her attitude towards us. Being a mum of twins and an 8 year old life is daunting enough when going on a shopping trip without the pure ignorance from a member of your staff. I m very disappointed with the lack of customer service from your member of staff and suggest you re train in common sense aswell as customer service. I am tagging our local twins groups in this post to give them fair warning if they attempt to take children in the changing rooms in a trolley with them!					2016-07-29T17:25:50+0000	1469813150	2016-07-29 19:25:50	30	22	43	6	71	22	16	6	26	0	30	0	4	0	0	9	0

I found a small maggot like creature living inside it.   Now  I m all for reducing food waste but imperfect aesthetic qualities are very different to health and hygiene standards which I suggest you do something about in your quality control for  imperfect  fruits and vegetables.  I think something should be done with regard to quality assurance of imperfect produce to ensure it is just imperfect to look at and not inedible.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13895527_10206741922254877_1410784741061823748_n.jpg?oh=68132b14bb4fb9e75264731a188e4b88&oe=58EA44FE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13895527_10206741922254877_1410784741061823748_n.jpg?oh=fedb282a931056552471ccbd8d9a5c45&oe=58DBA0F3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206741922254877&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-29T17:15:31+0000	1469812531	2016-07-29 19:15:31	15	2	15	0	17	1	1	0	0	0	15	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went shopping yesterday and tried to buy some at your Osterley branch  to be told by the grocer that they aren t selling King Edwards or Roosters anymore. I don t know if this means just that branch or all branches? I love Kings  hate Maris.					2016-07-29T15:58:28+0000	1469807908	2016-07-29 17:58:28	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Is this a bad batch or something? Are we gona have to switch to bourbons cos this would mean less in the packet and more disappointment?

Today I had a small order delivered which I paid extra to do so which is fine   however straight away the driver started to announce what was missing   I just simply said O this is not very good as I have paid extra to have it delivered and before I could say anymore this well built Driver was wagging his finger in my face   wedged his foot in my door   was raising his voice at me so much so that I asked him not to leave the shopping and he kept his foot in my door so I could not shut it  that I had to use all my strength to shut it as he was pushing on the other side of my door ! Is this an extra Thank You for been a loyal Customer   now we will intimidate you with our drivers  ? That is out last shop after all these years with Tesco !!! This was intimidating anti social behavior and as I am waiting for Tesco to get back to me   I am wondering if I should report it to the police because no one knocking on anyone s door should be made to feel under threat like this driver has left me feeling  Tesco you should be totally ashamed of yourselves   my loyalty to Tesco no longer exists !					2016-07-29T15:28:51+0000	1469806131	2016-07-29 17:28:51	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was appalled with the customer service I received at the cigarette kiosk when I went to purchase a crate of cider. Upon walking up to the desk (I had not yet reached the till) I was asked for identification and I was not offended in the slightest as I know you have a  challenge 25  rule.  However  when I showed my valid drivers license it was inspected thoroughly by the worker. As she inspected for longer than the usual person would I offered my student card (which holds a picture and my date of birth) and debit card to confirm my name. The worker informed me that my drivers license was not able to be used as ID as it was a UK drivers license  and was asked if I had an Irish one or my passport  and then directed to  try the off license across the street . I was not impressed as I left my passport at home (2 hours drive away) and wanted to buy a cider that is only available in the Republic of Ireland.  I found this interaction extremely discriminatory as I was singled out for holding a UK drivers license rather than an Irish one  and the way the situation was handled.  I was informed that it was  store policy  to not accept a UK drivers license and I would like to confirm if this is true  and if so  why would it not be accepted as valid identification?  Perhaps if the worker actually looked at my date of birth rather than trying to see it was fake there wouldn t be such an issue.					2016-07-29T15:27:43+0000	1469806063	2016-07-29 17:27:43	68	6	70	1	77	6	2	4	7	0	68	1	0	1	0	0	0

I had my work cut out  I thought   trying to raise the funds to run the summer school after government funding was cut. Our local branch not only helped enormously with the actual fundraising  standing alongside us and shaking buckets  providing a tombola and continuing to fundraise when we had left the store; but this week have made rolls and provided crisps  fruit and cakes as lunches for all students and staff every day whilst summer school was running. All for free. They also gave each child a box of chocolates for completing the summer school.  Here is a picture of the lovely staff (Claire and Warren) delivering the food to us.  Their kindness meant that we were able to take the students on a day trip and buy treats as well as also being able to run the school for an extra day  which I know from talking to parents was really beneficial to the students who attended.  Claire Bates and the team at Tesco extra in Abingdon have provided practical support to me which has really helped to ease the stress of running the summer school. Without their help  we wouldn t have achieved all we wanted to.  I can t thank them enough from myself personally  Claire has been amazing  so easy to talk to and contact. I would also like to thank them from Larkmead School  Abingdon.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13880303_10154400220224222_733956853718128819_n.jpg?oh=c83067f25b1d72f200e6189dc80f7ea7&oe=58E201A9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13880303_10154400220224222_733956853718128819_n.jpg?oh=2b7ed14481e11564fe09f4525235557f&oe=58DD9CBC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154400220224222&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-29T15:01:17+0000	1469804477	2016-07-29 17:01:17	41	4	42	8	54	4	2	2	3	0	41	1	0	0	0	0	0

Anti slip flooring  wet floor signs or relocation of flowers to an area that s not a busy walk way. I know it s a difficult one and things happen. But to safe guard anyone further it might be worth considering. Thanks to both Matt and Jamie though from the store who helped clean up all the blood and gave him a toy to take his mind off things. He became a little lethargic upon leaving your store so took him to local A&E. He seemed to have perked up now but definitely a warning to both Tesco and to parents with little ones around these areas.					2016-07-29T14:57:37+0000	1469804257	2016-07-29 16:57:37	0	11	0	0	11	11	7	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will try and put more pics in the comments.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13876459_10154546697225967_2113418505658192299_n.jpg?oh=73a97afcfa320fbc0d7851a3c6f16013&oe=58E8F544	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13876459_10154546697225967_2113418505658192299_n.jpg?oh=d02cc1f82a8b572547151fc7eee35db5&oe=58ED4A49	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154546697225967&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-29T14:06:33+0000	1469801193	2016-07-29 16:06:33	2	8	2	0	10	8	4	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Placed an order to be delivered on Thursday and the driver called me due to road closure he can not deliver on that day and have to deliver next day. (I m sure not every road leading to my address will be closed.)  The next day morning they called me and told me there was some warehouse issues so they have to delay the delivery and will contact me again in the afternoon.  Now I just got a call again there might be too much orders so they are not able to deliver today.    The person called me advised me to contact customer service and reschedule  why it takes so much trouble for delivering a simple online order?					2016-07-29T13:24:02+0000	1469798642	2016-07-29 15:24:02	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They stand at the exit wanting you to set up a wee direct debit and shoot you a look of disgust if you say no. We all know this lot are on commission and they re hoping to guilt a few people into a £10 monthly direct debit on pay day.  I would like these  salesmen   because that s what they are  to be replaced with people collecting for local causes. You know  the people with buckets. Bonus points if they give you a sticker for being generous.  Lots of love   Darryl  P.S. You also sell bread batons in packs of three  I only ever need one at a time so if you could sell those individually I d be totally grateful.					2016-07-29T08:46:19+0000	1469781979	2016-07-29 10:46:19	3	2	3	0	5	2	1	1	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Collected my order and paid for my other bits of shopping.  All was going well. That is until I attempted to leave the store. As a wheeled my trolley out of the store all of the security sirens started to go off..  I pulled my trolley back and thought well it can be me as I have just collected items from the click and collect desk.  The sirens went off again! It was me and to add insult to injury a man shouted what have you nicked! I was utterly mortified.  I looked round to the security desk for someone to help me. No one was there. It wasn t manned.  I ended up having to go queue at the customer service desk on order to get this resolved.  The tags should have been removed at the click and collect desk.

Come on Tesco  we know how much this is killing and critically endangering many species all over the world due to the deforestation required to produce it.

Have just opened another can of your own brand chicken in white sauce. Thinking the last one was just a one off but what on earth have you done to the recipe. What used to be a nice product with quality chicken in a thick white sauce is nothing better than dubious pink strips of chicken in a sauce if you can call it that as it has the consistency of water. That s 2 cans now wasted. I take it you ve started sourcing this from some cheap foreign factory like many other products.

I am fine other than a badly bruised knee.  I reported this on your online chat facility as a few weeks prior I helped a gentleman up who had slipped on a piece of fruit in the same store.  Your online chat adviser told me he would complete an incident form and that I would be contacted within 48hrs.  That was over a week ago and I have had no response.  The incident was witnessed by a member of staff and would have been in cctv.  Please can you let me know how this is being dealt with.					2016-07-28T18:49:37+0000	1469731777	2016-07-28 20:49:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered new school cardigans this time last year.  They arrived and were not the correct style  being scalloped instead of plain per the cardigan on the school s section of the website.  I returned them and was told there was a problem with the supplier and the wrong style had been supplied for embroidery but  as I said above  that was a year ago.  Please let me know when I will be able to buy the knitted cotton cardigans with the school logo on again.  My children refuse to wear the sweatshirt fabric cardigans and 2 out of 3 will not wear the knitted cotton jumpers.

It s fine to ONLY put a cooking time on the front of the pack as long as it DOES get printed onto the packaging!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13879271_10154331757657629_2294212625453851172_n.jpg?oh=ffe483e43fdb668b31189ad3cb7ab18b&oe=591A18EE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13879271_10154331757657629_2294212625453851172_n.jpg?oh=a1db22f57e0cd3edbb597bb502daaad8&oe=58E820E3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154331757657629&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-28T16:36:26+0000	1469723786	2016-07-28 18:36:26	2	25	2	0	27	20	7	13	10	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Phoned Tuesday  Wednesday and today to be told they will now return my money in two to four days. They should not have taken my payment since it was a transaction void. They have not apologised for this. But funnily enough they have taking the one payment through quickly.  Would not recommend using these machines.

I d like to make a suggestion you get some extra long bags as you have a lovely selection of wrapping paper and it would really help customers out	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13631390_585400324954746_6310585956451154383_n.jpg?oh=31a22da163fb03bf1115363a9463c6da&oe=591EB561	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13631390_585400324954746_6310585956451154383_n.jpg?oh=d4c9146bdb5f1ca080c72fab736c7742&oe=58EB899E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=585400324954746&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-28T12:39:56+0000	1469709596	2016-07-28 14:39:56	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Inside the store was a company selling Paintballing experiences as was promoting a  special discounted offer . As he had recently been paint balling with some friend he asked his Grandmother if she could buy the offer £61.99 for his birthday. She agreed. As his birthday is not until December we have done nothing with the vouchers until today. I was aware when he cam home that the voucher was valid until 30.05.17 so there was not a problem. There however is a problem. The company promoting their services within you store is committing  in my opinion fraud  supported by yourselves allowing them to sell within the store. I have today looked at booking his party for the end of the summer holidays. I know very little about paint balling  not does my son or his grandmother. However this morning I have been researching and hence my comment about fraud. A  normal  party for an 11 year old group of 10 children  with 500 paintballs (the minimum really required for a good party) at most paint balling sites would cost between £275.00 £350.00. When looking at the voucher my son has  we were expecting a price to be less than this  after all is is a special offer with the Tesco store. I am sure you will be as surprised as I am to find out that a compatible party with the company you are promoting would cost a staggering £561.00 or over double my cheapest alternative quotation. How can Tesco possibly endorse companies that are being fraudulent and af course hide behind the terms and conditions although they are targeting in this case elderly and juniors who have no understand of what they are signing up to. Sadly my son s birthday money has now been spent and he has nothing other than a worthless piece of card to show for it. I look forward to hearing your comments. The company in question is IPG  International Paintball Group. Regards					2016-07-28T11:06:40+0000	1469704000	2016-07-28 13:06:40	0	11	0	0	11	11	3	8	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So a £100 shop incurs a £2 charge (total to pay of £102 upon collection of the goods) and the £2 deposit is then returned up to four days later?  If you do this for one order then you must be doing so for all of them  i d imagine you many thousands of orders a year nationwide then you have thousands of pounds sat in your accounts gaining interest until the four days expires and it is returned to the customer.   Why not take a deposit from the value of the shopping  so you d pay a £2 deposit and have £98 to pay when the goods are collected.

One occasion it forced me to change it 3 times before it would let me into the account.

Whereas all of us in this household have not. This is the third occasion in a two week period that our tesco milk has gone bad way before use by date. 3 x 4pints of tesco milk to be precise. Two of which were purchased at one store in the town and one in another in the town. I m sure we can t be the only people having this problem but thought it was best that this be brought to your attention. My concern is that it seems drinkable  smells and tastes fine  until you put the boiling water with it and it reveals itself as off! As you can see by the photo below this particular bottle is well within date but is not okay to be consumed!

However  today I was in a rush so didn t check every item I picked up stupidly (although your customers should not have to do this!!) I picked up two packs of these  one was at the very front and a few were pushed to the back as if the stock had just been rotated. I get home and start unpacking and notice one pack had run out on the 25th July!! Furious to say the least  they re hardly cheap at £2 for a pack of 2!

I was there for a few things but the main item on my mind was a chunky kit kat as they are my favourite treat and I had worked hard today so felt a multiple pack was in order.  But as I approached the kit kat chunkys in the confectionery section I was blown away.... What is this all about?  I had had a far too long a day to make any quick decisions on this.  The pressure had just become too much. How is it a deal of saving 50 pence wen 8 shud cost double the amount of 4 anyway? And 3 for a pound cost the same as 4 for a pound?  I found this too disturbing and left the store without my kit kat chunkys. I am willing to forgive u for this traumatic experience and look forward to receiving my years supply of kit kat chunkys for this massive inconvenience.  Yours sincerely   Gedro.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13879418_1094842643919856_1514194900045115682_n.jpg?oh=8a222bf8f7cfc09de027a791702ebfec&oe=58D7BED8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13879418_1094842643919856_1514194900045115682_n.jpg?oh=148d2867259dd92aac645abb51c0c2aa&oe=58EDF5CD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1094842643919856&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-27T21:05:07+0000	1469653507	2016-07-27 23:05:07	27	12	32	1	45	12	3	9	10	0	25	0	0	5	0	0	0

However  I must say that I think my parents are a more suitable fit for your advertising campaign and really show what Tesco is all about.  Here is how I imagine an advert to be:   The advert begins by showing the insides of a house beginning with the front room. The sun is shining brightly through the window and the faint tweeting of birds can be heard. A cat scampers through the shot. It then changes to the kitchen  you see a can of Tesco baked beans on the side – seemingly to have been missed when the shopping had been put away.  The camera now moves to the front door  a shadow appears on the other side of the door and some letters are pushing through the letterbox. Then  one more envelope is pushed through – a Tesco clubcard letter! It falls gracefully onto the top of the other  unimportant letters.  A scuffle is heard originating from upstairs. While still looking at the pile of letters  banging and crashing can be heard as two people come rushing down the stairs towards the letters – these would be my parents. They force their way towards the letters  fighting for the clubcard letter.   At the same time they both pick it up. Squabbling like a pair of children  they bicker and pull at the letter trying to get it in their control. The letter rips open. The clubcard vouchers have been destroyed!   Each parent now blames the other for the unfortunate damage of these little vouchers of glory. My dad tells my mum they were his – he fills ups with petrol at Tesco every week. My mum tells my dad they were hers – she does the weekly shop at Tesco. Each holding a ripped half of the vouchers they are bickering stronger about what is worth more club card points  the petrol or food shop.  Then my brother walks down the stairs  woken up by the commotion that has just gone on. He asks what the fuss is about – they are only vouchers. In his tired and somewhat confused state  he ambles into the kitchen and opens the can of baked beans and begins eating them.   In the final seconds  the Tesco logo and slogan appears ‘Tesco  every little helps.’ With the additional line of ‘Earn clubcard points on petrol and your grocery shop’.					2016-07-27T20:56:52+0000	1469653012	2016-07-27 22:56:52	1	1	1	1	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only you could come up with the fantastic idea of moving all your stock around on the first week of the school summer holidays. Shopping with children is soooo much fan when we know where stuff is. Just imagine the extra joy of not knowing where to find anything  while coping with little ones who don t want to be there  As for moving your free from range to the same lane as  normal  bread  cakes  cream cakes  etc. Inspired. It will be such fan now  can no longer simply avoid going past them  but actually have to explain every visit to a small child why they cannot have those other cakes  or that nicer looking bread. Pure genius to put the right next to each other.   And those big blue signs  saying where stuff has moved to. How cleaver to put them at the new location  instead of the old. Makes it more like a treasure hunt  with a note telling you when your right. Would make life so boring voting if they were at the old location so we actually had an idea where to look					2016-07-27T20:44:46+0000	1469652286	2016-07-27 22:44:46	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

What a pity that so many customers complain when something they have bought isn t up to the standard when they could help themselves. Get the problem solved by approaching staff in your own store who will help you quicker to avoid frustration or ring the department who deals with deliver use etc. It s so simple. Phone numbers are  there for a good reason.					2016-07-27T20:35:24+0000	1469651724	2016-07-27 22:35:24	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve attached a picture as evidence.  Normally I wouldn t really care  but it does beg the question   Why are there pieces of wood around the Tesco food preparation areas?  and  how does wood even get into a pizza in the first place if not made on the floor of a factory or in someone s garden? . Am I going to find a nail in a lasagne? A pin in the yoghurt? Will I serve up a maggoty pasta bolognese to a 4 year old next? It s gross. I d like an answer please before I beg off buying from your stores completely.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13669600_10154186212025202_1554723278426186792_n.jpg?oh=af481f41d1c7e316b3d6e2724f9e87be&oe=58D607C2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13669600_10154186212025202_1554723278426186792_n.jpg?oh=1191273d09cd7b5ea7ba0ee64bbdffac&oe=59202124	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154186212025202&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-27T20:22:35+0000	1469650955	2016-07-27 22:22:35	11	9	18	0	27	9	7	2	5	0	11	0	2	3	0	2	0

I m currently on a diet so the lucky sod got to enjoy them all to himself. Unfortunately after devouring the first donut and telling me how lovely it was he went back to enjoy the second donut only to find to his horror a bite sized portion was missing! He wanted me to write to you as it is quite simply not acceptable to sell such delicious donuts with portions missing. If you could please investigate this matter further it would be much appreciated as I would hate for other husbands to be left as disappointed as mine.

I Returned back to the store and spoke to the same member of staff showing them that one had a blue secured security strip and the other had a silver void strip that was tampered with. They assured me that the phone was brand new never opened another college interjected that the blue strips tare all the time. When realising I was talking about the silver void strip he said it was just an older sticker and the blue ones are the new ones. I asked if I should open it there in front of them they said no everything will be ok. They assured me again the phone was brand new never been opened.  When I came to opening the box once back home am particularly unimpressed to find the plastic screen cover on upside down taking this off the screen is covered in sticky finger prints and has text messages on from 12th July and Scuffs on the back cover. Thanks this means a 3rd trip back to the store to try and rectify this.					2016-07-27T19:56:05+0000	1469649365	2016-07-27 21:56:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought strawberries from your store in aldershot they were reduced and bought two. I just tucked into quite a few strawberries in one of the boxes and found a worm type creature in one of the strawberries. After seeing that I stopped eating and want to bin the other pack incase that has worms too. Since seeing that I feel sick thinking I may have eaten one. I am not happy at all with this. I attached a picture of the strawberry and worm.

I was told I was speaking to my local store (I wasn t!!) and was then told that my card hadn t been handed in. My partner works in our local store and decided to call again to make sure I had actually got to speak to our local store  as suspected I hadn t. A second call handler lied and told him he was speaking to our local branch  when my partner explained that he works in store he was told that call handlers are told to lie and say they work in whichever store you are looking for. This guy called our store and guess what... My card was there! I almost cancelled my card because one of your staff members couldn t be bothered checking  outstanding customer service right there 😡					2016-07-27T17:16:32+0000	1469639792	2016-07-27 19:16:32	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Seriously tesco  I had a back pack on the floor and my purse in my hand shopping to pack and in the time it took the assiatant to finish her conversation before she answered my call i could ve completed the transaction but for the computer locking me out.

Please can you pass over a huge thank you to the Falkirk retail park store  the slim  blonde lady in the pharmacy and manager Michelle. My 6 week old baby decided he needed a feed in the shop and started screaming  was waiting on medicine for him which the lovely lady rushed through  could hear James crying and came to me and gave me the prescription. Offered to help with my shopping and gave James a cuddle whilst I sorted his bottle. My day got worse as I went to till and after putting through a few items I realised I had forgot my purse. Michelle helped me out with this and then to my car. Big big thank you. Excellent customer care going above and beyond. Please make sure they are recognised!					2016-07-27T16:54:52+0000	1469638492	2016-07-27 18:54:52	109	16	113	3	132	16	7	9	22	0	109	4	0	0	0	0	0

He rang me at 3:10 and as I have limited signal he left an answer phone message to say he was there. I rang him back and he said he d waited but had left. He then said he couldn t bring my order. I rang your delivery hotline and after a lengthy conversation was told that they wouldn t deliver it until 9:30. Unacceptable. We have no food and 4 children to feed. Every little helps does it?? You can stick it where the sun doesn t shine!! I m now off to do a food shop....at Sainsburys!!

Not only should your staff not have to work in it - they should also have the common sense to action something as the shop is in not fit state to receive customers - I strongly suggest to get it closed and sort the problem - thank you					2016-07-27T14:49:21+0000	1469630961	2016-07-27 16:49:21	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only with one of your delivery drivers but with the store who I tried to talk to. I have a disabled space outside mine and my neighbours house  which one of your drivers seemed fit to straddle across both. So not just inconveniencing myself but my neighbour. I spoke to your driver who rudely told me that he is allowed to park in a disabled space for 5 mins including double yellow lines to deliver. If you check the Highway Code you will find this is illegal.  I phoned the store Portsmouth Extra  to ask what there policy was about parking in disabled spaces  to be told they didn t have a policy. After explaining to him the issues  I was just told they would speak to the drivers. His attitude was that he didn t really care and that was that. I think it s disgusting that something as simple as helping others etc and legal requirements of the rules of the road  that Tesco doesn t know the rules and allows their drivers to do what they want.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13775847_10153663586721770_5497617357025880326_n.jpg?oh=95838aceeb517f3619ada5fa78ef9e33&oe=58E2C231	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13775847_10153663586721770_5497617357025880326_n.jpg?oh=b0fef5c24bcacb0e6681b2e7de85969d&oe=58D6103C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153663586721770&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-27T14:44:47+0000	1469630687	2016-07-27 16:44:47	0	16	2	1	19	16	7	9	19	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

I was visiting your store to see if I could find the new toastie loaf from Genius. When I arrived I found that the store in Allerton had moved and expanded their free from section. The range of products was amazing. It was such a nice change to see a store manager that recognises the need for a wide range of free from products. Unfortunately my local store in Old Swan hasn t caught on yet.

By your Fratton branch there s a ally way lined with wild flowers and streaming with wildlife it s stunning and way better to look at then your petrol station. It was barely over grown and a pleasure to walk by  flowers were still blooming and looked lovely and teemed with wild life  yes living things and you decide to destroy it! As a massive company you take so much from this planet it was a pleasure to see you giving back but didn t last long.  I contacted your store who failed to take any personal details and they said they would talk to the grounds keeper.  That s not enough and a change in your policy is required you should nurture nature not destroy it.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13781663_10154383266648390_5594632959862989673_n.jpg?oh=5f58b6316b5ed240002f7b3b5c926857&oe=58E6E2D8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13781663_10154383266648390_5594632959862989673_n.jpg?oh=234df250f3e41948932d147bed6529f5&oe=58EBAFD5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154383266648390&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-27T13:30:33+0000	1469626233	2016-07-27 15:30:33	1	7	1	1	9	7	3	4	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My Wife ordered a set of 3 suitcases (14/07) from your Tesco Direct service which we have used a number of times with no issues. We are going away in 4 weeks To our sons wedding in Greece and decided to replace our tatty luggage with some new ones.. they were ordered and paid for.. to be delivered to our local Tesco shop only 150 yards from our house.. as my wife is disabled and needs 24 hour care that suited me as its a 2 minute trip. Today when the cases were due we were told they had been delivered to the wrong store!!!  Luckily that store is only a 10 minute drive so she said we would go and pick them up there instead.. but no.. we couldnt because the cases had been returned.. i mean how?? what?? when?? now she was imformed it could take 2 weeks for them to go back on stock and that at the moment she couldnt order more as they were showing as out of stock!!  I mean they were delivered and returned the same day?? surely they must of seen that they were for a different store to know to send them back anyway.. so why couldnt they just drive along one road.. YES REALLY.. ONE ROAD and deliver it to the right store??   I dont know how it went to the wrong store other than driver error.. which i get.. but to deliver them and return them in no time at all must surely mean the error was noticed immediately.. so.. again why as we were expecting them at  a store no more than 3 miles away at least get out phone number and ask if we could collect there??  really not impressed with this and will think seriously before using the service again.  UPDATE Rang and complained and was told that a set of luggage would be sent directly to our home address by the manufacturer.. asked when to expect and told it would be monday (25/07) at the latest.... today (27/07) had to call again to find out where the luggage was and was told the manufacturer didnt have our postcode.. ?? details available and supplied to the adviser on the 1st call.. then told a set would be with us tomorrow.. (28/07) now we have just got a call back saying it would be going to the store.. which one they couldnt say .. but would ring back to advise.. since the call my wife has had a seizure which i think was caused by the stress of this.. really not happy and all we get is one saying one thing and someone else saying different..now to top it all theyre showing online as back in stock!!! hope your happy.. cos im not.!!					2016-07-27T12:12:34+0000	1469621554	2016-07-27 14:12:34	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The staff members name was Carol. She was a delight. She spoke to my student directly  she saw that I was using BSL to prompt my student. She asked what I said then when talking to him she used the signs in showed her. I was very impressed. She asked his name and used it each time she spoke to him.   These extra little things she did took no extra time out of her day and cost nothing. But it made a huge difference to my students experience there.  So I just wanted to say thank you for that and keep up the amazing work.

It is great to have a local store for the occasional items and using the delivery service for our main shop.  The team are very helpful and friendly  so all good so far.  Unfortunately on the 2nd of July whilst eating one of your Tesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurts we encountered a pubic hair.  As you can imagine you would normally expect fruit  but not a body hair from the genital area.  The yoghurt had been half eaten when the hair was found  which is even worse.  We took the soiled item back to our main store where the very helpful assistant took all the information and processed a report to be sent off for further investigation.  So far so good  it was all taken very seriously  as it should be.  This is where the good customer service has stopped.  It is now 25 days since the incident and we have heard nothing from @Tesco #tesco. #epicfail from a customer service point of view.  I have phoned customer service and they said there is a letter on the way  but you could have hand delivered the letter by now.  They have said that they will send another letter  but again I have no idea how long that will take to arrive  if it ever does.  We want to start using Tesco again  but don’t have the confidence that you take your customer concerns and care seriously enough.  This was not a head hair or face hair  but a genital pubic hair.  How would you feel if you were half way through your yoghurt and you found one.  Awful.  Currently we have switched to using Asda (who I have to say have very nice delivery drivers  and seem to be cheaper for the weekly shop) until we hear anything from you to say sorry  or that you are taking this seriously it is difficult to remain the loyal customers that we have been for so many years.  You should be using correct GMP processes in the manufacture of dairy based items  and to find a pubic hair in the product is of deep concern that the processes that you have in place are not being followed.  As an organisation you should be concerned that this has happened.  Just to be taken seriously would be nice and that you are as concerned as I am that you have had some major failures in the manufacturing process of your own branded products.  Once again some sort of response would be great as we want to go back to using you for our shopping again as you do so many great things  clubcard points for example.  Many thanks in advance.

All was going well  until we got to the bananas  where my son decided he didn t want to be in the trolley. I tried all the calming techniques and food to calm him  but nothing worked.  As my son looks like an average 2 and a half year old  I started to receive comments and stares from the general public. When my sons difficulties started it was the comments and stares that resulted in my son and I not leaving the house  which subsequently resulted in my sons further development delays and me having a breakdown. We have worked hard to get where we are today. A member of your team called Mel  who asked if she could push my trolley so we could ensure a happier shopping experience. This may have been so the other customers didn t get put off by my screaming son  however for me it meant more than anything. My son calmly walked around the shop  holding my hand and Mel interacted with him  made him giggle and helped me getting things off the shelf. The extra staff who found bits  replaced broken/damaged goods I picked up  all while doing a stock take.  Also the other two ladies who helped with the packing at the end. I would like to thank each member of staff who assisted me today  but especially Mel. She has bought tears of happiness to my eyes today. If you have any awards for your staff  I would like to put Mel forward  as without her help today  I think I would ve given up again. Kindest regards Michelle (a very tired and stressed mummy of Charlie  the noisy tinker)					2016-07-27T10:39:32+0000	1469615972	2016-07-27 12:39:32	218	27	242	21	290	27	16	11	60	0	217	24	0	0	0	0	0

We live locally. My sons 11 (12 on Friday) he has learning difficulties and we are awaiting an assessment for autism. He finds shopping really difficult. We get alsorts of behaviours as you can imagine. So by the time we finally get to the check out as you can imagine I m fraught from trying to keep him calm and he s wound up and frustrated because it s too much. But it s summer holidays and needs must! So I got to the check out and the gentleman who was serving us got him scanning the items through the till with the hand held scanner. It automatically defused Ryan and he started to relax and laugh! Something that doesn t usually happen in supermarkets. I don t think this man (I ve forgotten his name sorry) even realised how much of a godsend he was! My other son was with us too and he let him have a go too. It made the whole process off packing our bags so much easier! We had no behaviours at the check out and he stayed calm. The whole experience was a positive one. It made for a better evening when we got home right down to it being easier to get him into bed. It also gave him something to focus on rather than him being focused on negatives. He will never forget the experience! So thank you Tesco your man deserves to be praised!					2016-07-27T09:24:24+0000	1469611464	2016-07-27 11:24:24	6	2	6	0	8	2	2	0	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

At your Fratton Portsmouth store at 8am and greeted at the self service area by a dark haired mature store worker.

I m just curious to if you have any recipes for how to bake half rotten potatoes? Funnily enough  I tend to like my food fresh  and not rotting.  Its getting ridiculous now. Last week i was missing mince  and every week my fresh produce is about to go out of date  bread  veg  fruit  even though it will say 4+ days when i order. This has been every single weekly shop for over 4 months.

I bought some Tesco Go Create  felt pens  and made the assumption that they were for children. However my small granddaughter used them and left the top off one. It managed to seep its ink into my fave t shirt  and horror of horrors......would NOT WASH OUT even with a high end stain remover  and had to be binned. So disappointed. I used to be a teacher and all our school felt pens were washable unless VERY CLEARLY MARKED AS PERMANENT. Very disappointed  and I think the product should be investigated so folk are clear what they are purchasing. Hope you will look into this.

On the way to the tills to finish my shop on Monday  my daughter who is 20months old fell over herself and hit her face against the edge of a shelf. As you can imagine she was very upset by this but Nanette stepped in to help calm her down. After seeing my daughter fall she suddenly appeared with an  Upsy Daisy  talking doll that she removed from its packaging and handed to her. The tears stopped and my daughter was soon smiling. This act of kindness made an upset little girl and her mummy very happy. Thank you so much.					2016-07-27T07:32:49+0000	1469604769	2016-07-27 09:32:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Victor isn t your average security guard  he s a great aspect of the store. He welcomes every customer. He is always up for a chat and always has a big smile! He helps lots of the customers with anything really! I always see him on my lunch break and he welcomes me with a big hand shake and a smile and then asks how my day is going and if I say it s not going very well then he likes to change that around. He s a great treasure to the Tescos team and you re very lucky to have him. It s nice to see someone spreading love and not hate these days.   He has time for everyone  and sadly that s rare now.   - a happy customer.					2016-07-26T23:07:59+0000	1469574479	2016-07-27 01:07:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apparently they couldn t prove that I wasn t buying it for her!! Really? Has the world gone mad?  Whilst complaining to customer services on the phone  I was told I would probably be better leaving my daughter outside whilst I did my shopping!

There was also a man there unable to fill his car with petrol & another lady wanting to use the store. The lady told us how frustrating this was as it s happened a number of times before.

Every time I go to Tesco these days the onions are absolutely stinking!  You end up throwing out or cutting away half the onion as its brown inside and rotten.   I reported the issue to Dave as I was walking around the store and he told me they were  Spanish Onions . Enough said.  Dave told me to report it to customer service as they might give you something free.  I said I don t want something free  I just want an onion for my dinner.  Anyways   I was nearing the end of my shopping and out pops Dave from the behind the cans of beans.   Here sir   have them on me...  A full pack of Red Onions. Ya Dancer!   Get to the checkout and big Dave had already cleared it with the checkout staff.    What an absolute legend.  If your store was full of Dave s you d never lose a customer.

I was on my own with my son! We arrived at the checkout as usual  and there was a young lad behind the till  he asked if my 3 year old son wanted to help him scan the items  of course he jumped at the chance! The young lad actually got up out of his seat  and sat my 3 year old there and let him scan all the items  while i could pack the items in to bags  i didnt catch the lads name  BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH! Great customer service!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13769428_1386690894680058_205399428940224894_n.jpg?oh=c16f16b369c27f0fa24390e0cb878fb2&oe=58E3738D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13769428_1386690894680058_205399428940224894_n.jpg?oh=0b488a39aa3f180d9564c4f8c75e2254&oe=58D9FD72	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1386690894680058&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-26T18:24:22+0000	1469557462	2016-07-26 20:24:22	1813	121	1924	122	2167	121	71	50	622	0	1786	101	3	4	0	0	0

He went out of his way to give us a warm welcome. On walking around the store we noticed he did this to every single customer entering and leaving the store. It was so lovely and refreshing to be greeted by this man and made a massive difference to our experience! Well done to Ola at the whitely branch  he definitely deserves recognition 😊					2016-07-26T18:23:29+0000	1469557409	2016-07-26 20:23:29	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now  it did strike me as odd but I m as open minded as the next fella so I looked up and down to see if anyone else was bare in the store.   There wasn t.   Feeling like I didn t want to stand out from the crowd  I chose not to bare with you  Tesco. I apologise. As a bearded chap with a somewhat fuller figure  I felt it best to remain clothed so as to not distract other shoppers with my naked form let alone be harrassed by legions of people who  I m sure  would have flocked to marvel at me.   I did have a brief moment where I thought about seeking out a Here To Help colleague for directions but chose to buy what I came for and carried on about my business.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13775878_10157147891620398_1405881249970074418_n.jpg?oh=85ffee99f9e0de0ae3cc0fcad4e20e7b&oe=591F9448	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13775878_10157147891620398_1405881249970074418_n.jpg?oh=5c63e032611eda4be5067db8c42d5021&oe=58DD6B45	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157147891620398&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-26T18:19:48+0000	1469557188	2016-07-26 20:19:48	15	0	20	0	20	0	0	0	0	0	15	0	0	5	0	0	0

I believe his name was Rob. We had the wrong frozen goods delivered (ended up with someone else s) although disappointed and frustrated as it meant another trip to the supermarket  which I was trying to avoid. I knew it wasn t the delivery drivers fault.  He went away very apologetic and 4 hours later we had a knock on the door  the delivery driver on the next shift had come back with the right frozen goods for us arranged by Rob. I can t thank him enough for taking the time to do this for us. It really is the small things sometimes 👏👏👏👏					2016-07-26T18:16:09+0000	1469556969	2016-07-26 20:16:09	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Wasn t allowed to take any meat from the boxes the staff were putting them in  so basically no one was able to get any fresh meat at all with the shop still open for 45 mins. Ruined my dinner plans and probably many other people just getting out of work. Shouldn t cleaning be something done after hours rather than inconveniencing customers by taking product away while the shop is still open?					2016-07-26T18:04:52+0000	1469556292	2016-07-26 20:04:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was intending on coming over to apologise that my brother was driving erratically  and explain that it wasn t intentional but that he was feeling very unwell and was rushing to the toilets. However after you started shouting across the carpark and intentionally trying to draw others into the conversation and taking the **** that my brother was ill. I no longer wish to apologise u would however like you to understand that my brother won t be driving like that however I presume  you will still be walking in the middle of the road and expecting to cause upset and arguments!					2016-07-26T17:53:32+0000	1469555612	2016-07-26 19:53:32	0	6	0	1	7	6	2	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I came to the tesco store in Carlton Nottingham around 6.15pm and saw how busy the car park was. I saw a lady getting out of her car with no child in her car but parked in a mother and baby space. The last space might I add. Now I was not happy as I had my 9 week old with me and no bigger spaces for my to park in.  As the lady was walking off I noticed she was wearing a tesco uniform. She looked at me and walked off. The cheek of it!!! I gather she was off to work her evening shift!!!					2016-07-26T17:53:00+0000	1469555580	2016-07-26 19:53:00	0	24	0	0	24	24	4	20	10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Teabags we don t drink tea YAY 3rd coupon lucky extra points on lactose free milk BONUS!!! so i suggest you or your machine takes a look at our shop & provides coupons for what we purchase. please stop trying to promote certain brands.  it s an absolute waste of paper & ink!!! last month we received coupons for your meat counter we buy Quorn products that are expensive so coupons for this brand would be greatly appreciated!!			http://to.pr/	to.pr	2016-07-26T17:51:48+0000	1469555508	2016-07-26 19:51:48	3	3	3	0	6	3	1	2	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Go to customer services! So on the way down I asked at 3 tills and greggs and got the same answer! So I went to customer services and joined the long queue of people and waited 15 mins and the queue didn t move once so I have now left your store empty handed and will now do my regular shop elsewhere!

When shopping last Sunday I slipped over in a very large puddle in the fruit and veg section after stepping off the  non slip mats. The puddle was so large and slippery that it was only by the help of my trolley that I managed to get back up. I can t understand in such a large main branch there was only one caution sign put out down the other end of the isle and nowhere near the actual wet area  even one at each end of the isle seems the safe and logical answer.  When I found a member of staff who was floating about the till area so that more signs and safety privations could be issued she just told me that the fridges were broken and they knew they were leaking. She was very rude and off hand to me considering I had just fallen over.   It has now been a few days since falling and my knee is still very bruised which has made walking and working extremely painful.

Just been in your store looking for dumpling mix vegetarian  to find it on the reduced isle as its discontinued along with the glass Bisto vegetarian gravy?? Can I ask why when vegetarian & veganism is one of the fastest growing diets??

Ordered over £100 worth of shopping to be delivered today. I had amended my order yesterday morning taking off at least 16 items and adding quite a few extras. However today I have received all the items I didn t want and have not received any items I did want! Phoned up and explained  and have been told to reorder the items for tomorrow and get the other items sent back. I ve been given a voucher which just about covers the extra delivery cost and the extra cost for the order not being over the £40 basket value. But what about the inconvenience it is causing me  having to stay in again tomorrow to wait for more shopping when I have other things to do! This isn t the first time this has happened to us. Whether it s a system error or not  I m considering taking my money elsewhere! Sort it out Tesco!					2016-07-26T17:09:42+0000	1469552982	2016-07-26 19:09:42	0	10	1	0	11	10	2	8	3	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

I was dealt with by a fantastic customer person  but very disappointed by the situation! Living in the area is hard enough in August! Oh  and I pay delivery saver.

It allowed me to put it in my basket still showing available ..... Then on checkout a message pops up with this item is currently unavailable. So being loyal to tesco I called up and asked if any of my local shops have any ( I m willing to travel to pick it up) and I would go and buy it from there  only to be told that yes you do have stock but in the shops it s £120 ...... This is a big difference  1. How can you have it at two different prices and 2. How can you justify such a big price jump! Speaking with the customer service and apparently that s   just how things are   you clearly do have stock of them as they ve just told me you have so why can I not purchase it at this price? And why is it saying out of stock when it s not. I didn t appreciate the tone of the customer service rep either  this has not been a great customer experience !!!! I don t think I ll be shopping with you again unless this can be resolved  I ll await your reply.

Today  I was a bit lost of what to eat and was in one of those moods where I was so hungry  I needed something both filling and delicious to put a smile back on my face before getting back to the grind... Until I came upon the gorgeous pile of avocados in the fresh fruit and veg section. I instantly felt inspired and my hunger grew into a need for one thing and one thing only. An avocado sliced up into little green half-moons laying on a warm  toasted baguette drizzled with olive-oil and finished with some fresh cherry tomatoes (salt  pepper and chilli powder of course).  So that was it  the decision was made. I gave them all a good fondle until I found the perfect combination of softness and firmness in one of the green south american fruits and skipped my way to the checkout.  I got back to our little studio kitchen with the biggest smile on my face until I cut it open. That was the moment everything changed.  On the chopping board in front of me laid the physical embodiment of a smell worse than most. My perfect avocado was in-fact.. rotten to the core. I am heartbroken and my work colleagues have only just managed to bring me round enough to go back to the outside world in search for something else to eat.  Kindest regards   Hangry Alex.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13626418_276374612729980_3480187142010683350_n.jpg?oh=fb2b3252a760259ac792229130796deb&oe=58EC78BE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q84/s720x720/13626418_276374612729980_3480187142010683350_n.jpg?oh=b136ec3f3ace92efaf4c5e210b7209ed&oe=58D97468	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=276374612729980&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-26T14:46:53+0000	1469544413	2016-07-26 16:46:53	48	10	54	0	64	10	4	6	21	0	47	2	0	0	4	0	0

She walked around the whole store with me for an hour clutching a Num Noms toy only to be told they could not sell the toy as it wasn t on the system. I understand that this happens sometimes but I also know that you CAN sell the item another way. Please don t display items such as toys if you haven t got them on your systems.  The lady on the till was really lovely but the customer service experience would have been much better if her supervisor had been willing to sort this out.  Off to Smyths toys now where I am sure they will be more than willing to sell us the same toy.					2016-07-26T11:27:48+0000	1469532468	2016-07-26 13:27:48	1	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

I therefore asked why they had not anticipated that more would be required at this time of year and therefore allowed for this in their stock. The answer was that they don t sell enough during the rest of the year!! I didn t quite know what to answer but then began to wonder if this meant tesco were no longer going to stock Christmas decorations or Easter eggs-why would they when they won t sell enough throughout the rest of the year?					2016-07-26T11:14:13+0000	1469531653	2016-07-26 13:14:13	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I do not have their names  I was not in a position to get them.  Last week I was taken ill with an anaphylactic shock in the store.  I had my husband and young daughter with me at the time.  My husband gave me the adrenalin treatment that I needed  while store members took care of my daughter and called an ambulance for me.  While I was unconcious they brought a cushion and blanket and the first aider sat by me and kept my husband calm.  Once I had been taken away in the ambulance  they helped him fetch the shopping that we had originally needed to collect for a meal for our other children  waiting at home.  My daughter had been well cared for and kept happy  away from seeing me in such a condition.  My husband has been in a couple of times since then and they have asked about me  which is very much appreciated.  I made my first trip back there last night (waited until late so that the store was quite quiet) which was scary  but something that I had to do.  I very much appreciate everything that was done in the store for me that day and wish that I could do more to thank the people involved.  The A+E doctor says that my husband saved my life by realising what was happening and giving me my epipen in time  and the people in the store gave me great peace of mind by knowing they cared for my husband and daughter while I could not.  You have some great employees at this store  Tesco  I hope you appreciate them as much as I do.  Thank you.					2016-07-26T10:33:49+0000	1469529229	2016-07-26 12:33:49	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However because I know which store my groceries come from I went there as I had forgotten something  and what did i discover. The products which I was told that were not availible online  where plentiful (stacks) of them instore.  Does tesco do this to make people go intore? Doing shopping online is supposed to make it convienient  however if you make products unavailible online whilst you have stacks of them instore  it makes it very inconvienient. Why do you do this?  Can t your servers hold all the information  if not upgrade them! - Most shops are going the other way carry less instore and put more items online.					2016-07-26T09:01:51+0000	1469523711	2016-07-26 11:01:51	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have an 11 month old baby with numerous food allergies who drinks hemp milk. The store had sold out and she went above and beyond to help me-checking when it will be back in stock  calling me this morning to say it was in and asking how many I wanted so they could be put aside for me. It s difficult enough finding things for my baby to eat/drink and Mandy s help made it that bit easier and took the stress away.

It was really important to me to find a particular bottle of Cava  Saul knows why and not only had he gone above and beyond my expectations he has proved to me that tesco listen to their customers not only as consumers  but as human beings.

Stores could select charities or good causes in their local communities to support  it seems to me there are millions of points going unclaimed daily   I m pretty sure a huge chunk of your consumers would readily back good causes  in their communities.

If you were to check my clubcard records you d see that I spend hundreds of pounds a week with you (and obviously you get all that juicy clubcard data about my spending habits that go with it)  and have done for countless years. I m a huge Tesco fan by choice  and quite often you d find me singing your praises to other people when I talk about my  Big Shop Monday  trip to your Stockport store  largely down to the lovely staff you have there.  I feel we ve developed a great relationship. I ve stuck with you through the lean years  when you were  creative  with your accounting and everyone left you for the discount stores  or went upmarket and visited to Waitrose. That wasn t me though. Your prices suited me fine  and your staff in Stockport are always making sure that every little helped.  When I found there were a few items on my shopping list that I couldn t fulfill in Stockport tonight  I didn t think of going to the nearby Sainsbury s or Asda I would pass on the way home.  No  I thought   I ll stick by Tesco and go to Stalybridge  because I prefer Tesco.  I am such an awkward customer. You go out of your way to keep these stores open 24 hours a day for my convenience  so that I wouldn t need to visit my local corner shop run by  the little guys . Of course if you re always open then you re going to need to do your store shelf moves before 10pm on a Monday night. I can t believe what a fool I am for not realising this until now!  There was me just wanting to grab a packet of ice cream wafers in Stalybridge that weren t available in Stockport  but clearly this is too much to ask when you need to move your shelves around. And foolishly I thought those signs up everywhere saying words to the effect of  ask a member of staff for help if you can t find what you re looking for  were genuine! Silly me  of course the staff don t want to be interrupted from their casual chatting to try and help a customer! Why on earth would they want to make the company money from a sale  when they must get on with this shelf move (and the casual chat)?!  As you may have guessed by now  my request for assistance to find what I was looking for fell on deaf ears  because said ice cream wafers could have been in any number of the crates  and despite me talking to the lady who filled the crates  she couldn t possibly stop working on filling the shelf she was focusing on and check any of the crates  because she couldn t remember which crate they were in  and there were so many crates around not to mention the crates in the warehouse. And in any case  I could just wait around because once the other lady had finished working on the pile of boxes she was assigned  she might be going to unpack the ones that have the ice cream wafers in next! In hindsight  I should have realised what a wonderful offer this was  but here s me being an awkward customer again  wanting to get home and unpack my other shopping from Stockport.  When I interrupted the customer services lady from doing her shopping at the pharmacy (she was still on shift  as when I was leaving she was back working behind the customer services desk)  and asked her if I was being unreasonable in my request to have someone help me locate a product that I could exchange money for (pretty sure that s the business you re in?) she kindly showed me the error of my ways in asking this!  I ve worked in retail before  so I know how difficult customers like me are. We re the worst sort  because deep down we should know better from our own experiences of those pesky customers who want to purchase goods  keeping the company we work for in business and paying me a wage!  So that s it Tesco: that s why I am so sorry for trying to be a customer tonight. I really will try to be a better human and not have such high expectations the next time I come in store. And I will come in store still - ours is a long story still to be told. But just don t expect me to be so happy about visiting you from now on.  Yours apologetically					2016-07-25T22:39:49+0000	1469486389	2016-07-26 00:39:49	17	20	20	0	40	20	6	14	11	0	17	0	0	3	0	0	0

I have just rang your customer service department who have informed me to go to the doctors as I am still experiencing stomach problems after two days of use! I have not ate or drank anything different  so I have come to the conclusion that this is the cause of my stomach bug over the passed few days. I ve been asked to take the contents into store as well as seeing the doctors.

Last time it was a completely unhelpful and rude driver. It s not good enough - will be switching to another supermarket at this rate  Tesco obviously don t value us as customers who are loyal and actually pay for a premium delivery plan.

Maybe instead of patronising my husband and ignoring what he is saying can I suggest you update things on time to avoid getting complaints and losing service. However  I am not surprised as the last time I complained after eating a mouthful of mud in a prepacked salad and being told I would be refunded and given £5 compensation all I got was a straight refund.   No compensation for a mouthful of mud then??? Your response to being advised of a pricing error is simply to tell my husband he is wrong??? Happily my ocado order is booked for tomorrow  I had previously considered changing due to delivery timing issues but your awful customer services has helped me to decide so thanks for that.  (Please no patronising responses  it wasn t cache  though I can t believe we are having to explain that again )					2016-07-25T17:50:09+0000	1469469009	2016-07-25 19:50:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As my key bunch had a Tesco clubcard fob- it was handed in to the local express Tesco store. A kind employee tried to track down my details via the clubcard however unsuccessfully and then resumed to contact a local gym as it had the membership fob in the key bunch. They were able to contact me directly via the gym membership contact details.  I cannot express how thankful and appreciative I am towards all those involved in this process to reunite me with my keys including the person who handed them in  to those at the gym who were willing to help. However the lady at your store went above and beyond her call of duty by trying to find my details via any means necessary. I would like to pass on my sincerest thanks and gratitude to Ms Charlie Fletcher at your Sutton Coldfield express store for being an amazing person as well as an invaluable employee and asset to your company. I was unable to meet her directly as she had finished her shift by the time I had time to go collect my keys... I hope that these words will reach her directly.

What s the point in having a clubcard app to save you carrying a clubcard about if it keeps logging you out the app  then when you log back in it asks you to verify the card number?? Erm that s why I have an app so I don t need the card!! Surely an email address and password is fine to log in? And Why do you log people out the app anyway?!					2016-07-25T17:01:24+0000	1469466084	2016-07-25 19:01:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When inquiring in store on Sunday 24th July we were told that we could order 20 bunches of white flowers for our wedding in September  but we needed to go in store today to put the order through with the manager....so we attended to store today was told this was not possible in a very abrupt way  I explained that we had  had a conversation  yesterday and that I wanted to speak to someone.... we waited around 15 minuets  then she spoke to a manager who she had told me was not working and once again told we could not order these flowers.... I am so angry that within 24hrs we have gone from having the flowers we wanted ready to be ordered to being told we couldn t!!!!!! Tesco need to sort themselves out!!!!!!!					2016-07-25T17:01:13+0000	1469466073	2016-07-25 19:01:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just driven up to Seacroft  having planned to put my car in for a wash & valet at 5.30 whilst buying my shopping. The car wash shuts at 6...which was a surprise as your website says 7!

She has just left school and was hoping to get a part time job to see her through sixth form college.  She had the interview and was told she would be contacted either way within the week. Over a month later and she hasn t even had an email.  This is my daughters first taste of the jobs market! Thank you Tesco. You have done wonders for a bright 16 year olds confidence!  I really would have thought better of a big company like yourselves and your HR department. Shame on you!					2016-07-25T16:22:53+0000	1469463773	2016-07-25 18:22:53	4	7	6	0	13	7	3	4	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	2	0

As I have had to do several times recently  I took the overcharged item to customer services.  She went and got a weedkiller tag from the shelves and agreed I had been overcharged.  She wrote all the info down in a booklet and told me she had to put it through the computer as an over charge so it would take a few minutes.  5 minutes later  she realised she d got the wrong label from the shelves.  Clearly  going back to the shelf was too much hard work so she just agreed with the price I d said.    What I did notice was  while she was writing in her book  was that she d initially written the refund as £7 but then only gave me £3.50.  I ve now looked at your T&C and seen that if we are overcharged  we should get back double the difference (hence the £7).  Because SHE couldn t be bothered to go through the process again  I didn t receive this promise.  In fact  I ve never received this despite returning several wrongly priced items!! It appears to be a promise that is obviously only given to those who know about it!!  Another very recent example I have is buying Stampy s Lovely Book as a present.  I was charged £7.99 when the ticket price was £4.  Again  I had to spot the mistake and take it up with customer service.  Again  no  double the difference  applied to my refund.  Disappointed in the service!					2016-07-25T16:14:12+0000	1469463252	2016-07-25 18:14:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 3 year old son has been banging on about this remote control truck since he first seen it about 2 weeks ago. He saved all his little pocket money and we went to Tesco Yate and just brought this. He was so excited when we got home we brought the batteries for it and popped them in. The car works but there must be something wrong with the controller the thing won t stop moving forward it won t steer and won t reverse.

Not only is it hard enough to take my 17 month old twins out shopping to then have to hunt the two seater trolley down which is pretty much impossible as you only have 8 for the Tesco extra with hundred of shoppers at one time. I am left with three options option 1) abandon my children in the car to hunt the elusive trolley down which could take forever in the meantime could well be reported for leaving children u attended  option 2) use the one seated trolley and put the other on the trolley which I don t feel comfortable about  or option 3) take my pushchair and get only what I can carry. This is not acceptable as shopping at Asda or Tesco Thornbury is never a problem but it s always the same in the Bradley Stoke store. I spoke with the trolley collector and he said he has been telling them this for ages I also spoke with one of the managers Marika who told me that they are aware of this and will look into getting more double seated trolleys. I must say I would hesitate shopping here again until I know the situation have changed.					2016-07-25T15:16:29+0000	1469459789	2016-07-25 17:16:29	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not just that but I was only just praising the member of staff that delivered my shopping for me  he was very polite and nothing was too much trouble such as bringing the shopping to my front door which is on the second floor of my building. With a toddler & a partner that sleeps in the day to work at night it s quite difficult to go up and down the stairs continuously and who I previously ordered my food shop with had changed rules & refused to help me out so again I just wanted to thank you for the amazing customer service I will continue to use Tesco as its the little things such as a hand up the stairs that mean a lot to some people! :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13620062_10154023572238778_8463557862031711745_n.jpg?oh=d6467d9f1306057496276a1ee892a503&oe=58EBAC71	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13620062_10154023572238778_8463557862031711745_n.jpg?oh=747112303ac8157808d5723c52bc1f61&oe=58E3417C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154023572238778&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-25T15:02:06+0000	1469458926	2016-07-25 17:02:06	8	4	8	0	12	4	2	2	2	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was away down south for work yesterday and came home to see that the bread i bought had an off date of the same day. I just wanted to exchange the bread as it shouldn t have an off date of 12 hrs or less?. the policy says within its eat by date   you close at 6 pm and i wasn t home until 10pm. I asked to just exchange the bread as its already off. .85p wasted   yes i should ve inspected it harder when i grabbed it but i grabbed first one on shelf. are you guys that hard up for .85 that you cant ask the supplier for a credit on the off date bread and let me exchange it ?.					2016-07-25T15:01:32+0000	1469458892	2016-07-25 17:01:32	0	3	0	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On the website the item I wanted was showing as £19 but every time I put it in the basket it was coming up as £35. This was using my mobile so tried with my pc. Same thing happened. I ve called customer services who didn t seem to want to listen to my problem / complaint  (which was the difference between advertised price and checkout price) and was just told repeatedly the item wasn t in the sale anymore. OK  but that doesn t address the falsely advertised price issue. So  was also told there was nothing that could be done. I m sorry  I hate that phrase as it s simply not true. I asked to speak to someone else only to be told the manager would only tell me the same thing. Thanks  but I ll speak to them all the same. Turns out they weren t available. What customer service arrangement doesn t have a line of escalation available? Conveniently  while I was on the lphone the price error had been fixed.  I was told the manager would call me back. Needless to say that didn t happen. So thanks Tesco  for the sake of a £16 error I will be taking my literally thousands of pounds my family spends with you elsewhere unless I am at least acknowledged.

You have to escalate things to the Concerns Team before you have a chance in hell of finding someone who has any knowledge but then you get denied your rights anyways. If Tesco Mobile or one of their employees makes a mistake then Tesco Mobile are responsible for fixing it or at least trying to. And then to offer a  goodwill gesture  that doesn t even cover the potential cost of my sporting the problem out is quite frankly insulting.

I m a student nurse (with very little money) who purchased an acer laptop in store 4 months ago (14-03-16). The laptop purchased was recommended by a Tesco employee as being one of the  best  laptops for students and my needs. Since Iv had the laptop it crashed on the first day of purchase and it has crashed an broken down on many many occasions (more than 60 times at least) resulting in me taking the laptop back to store to be fixed. On Saturday (23-07-16) the hard drive broke stating  No Bootable Device . I phoned the Tesco help line to be told by a very rude man that there was nothing he can do an I need to contact Acer on Monday morning. As I only have one week of my second year at university left I have a lot of work that needs to be completed  printed off and handed in to the university to demonstrate I am still competent when caring an treating vulnerable patients. All this work was on the laptop. Although I had backed up majority of it I have lost the last 4 months of work since Iv owned the laptop as the laptop was failing to save my work on my memory stick an I only just found this out  In absolute desperation I went in to Tesco store to seek help  well  not only am I an exhausted over-worked nursing student I was completely inconsolable when the un-empathetic technical support manager told me that he will not do anything to help  would not offer any solution except phone Acer. I explained  to the manager I only needed a laptop for  just 1 more week an if I worked 18-20 hour days for the next 7 days straight I just might be able to re-do all the work lost  that s providing I can do it from memory. But again NO HELP  NO SOLUTION  not even the offer of a loan laptop for 1 week this I was willing to pay for and go overdrawn on my bank BUT NO!!! So as you can guess I left the store crying my eyes out an panicking about how I m going to pass this year at uni. So yes I phoned Acer this morning (25-07-16)  only to be told before I send the laptop to Acer to be fixed I HAVE TO PAY a technician to recover the work on the laptop  I had a quote a few years ago an it was hundreds of pounds so as I can barely afford to eat on my bursery this is not an option so I will lose all my work  THEN Acer told me they will send me an email which I need to open on the laptop an I can print of the return label 😂 HOW !!! My laptop is broken so instead I now have to wait up to several days for the return label to be sent in post   rap the laptop in exactly 4 inches of bubble rap which I have to pay for  then put it in a cardboard box which I have to pay for  then rap the box in brown paper which I have to pay for  drive to the other end of town to post it (fuel I have to pay for) an if the UPS delivery service damage the laptop then Acer will not cover the damage  FANTASTIC customer service NOT !!!! Oh and the best part is I will be with out my laptop for up to 6 weeks  so now tesco/Acer have my money and they will have my laptop. So I have no money an no laptop an out of pocket for bubble rap cardboard box an brown paper an fuel and 4 months worth of my wasted time AND NO Chance of completing this year at university so THANK YOU Tesco for your discussing appalling non existent customer service. Please don t teach your employees to ask if they can help because they don t  words are cheap an actions speak loader than words.  Yours sincerely  an overworked exhausted underpaid no longer student nurse xx					2016-07-25T12:04:51+0000	1469448291	2016-07-25 14:04:51	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Have always recommended them and said how good they were due to a few years ago when our dog was ill and they really looked after her. Now a few years later (no more health concerns or issues) we have two dogs insured with them . I have now found out our older dog who was the one who was ill has just had the premium go up from £88.00 and is now £164 .00      My 1 year old dog I have just found out is now on the phone to Tesco was £18.47 and is now  £33.50                       I asked the lady on the phone why . The reply as due to her age (15.01.07) and government policies / tax vet fees have gone up / changed etc . This was rhymed off from a sheet. So the lesson is loyal customers with older dogs beware. Your premium can be set to double and you have no choice to stick with it. Anyone would think they were pushing us in a corner purposedully to cancel. Is this happening to anyone else?					2016-07-25T11:59:14+0000	1469447954	2016-07-25 13:59:14	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a 3 month old baby and a 3 year old so shopping in store is a bit of a challenge. This week I took my 3 month old and decided to use shop and scan. Seemed like a good idea and although it took a little longer as I m not used to it it was easier when I got to the checkout. The problems I found were  the trolley that I used (the car seat trolley) did not have a holder for the scanner. So not only could I not see over my trolley  I had to push it whilst holding my shopping list and the scanner! I was selected for a random bag check  fine  except a member of your staff took several items out of my perfectly packed bags and dumped them back in the trolley. Thanks for that  really helpful!! Then when I came to have a coffee after my shop the trolley doesn t fit in the trolley park so I had to drag the ridiculously heavy trolley round the tiny cafe with me!!!! Please sort this out Tesco  for those with newborns/children of any age the shop is already hard enough! Thanks  a hopeful parent.					2016-07-25T07:08:48+0000	1469430528	2016-07-25 09:08:48	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The tesco extra store down in Galashiels in the borders has advertised as 24/7 and it has always been the case. I travelled all the way from Peebles last night to go for a late night shop as no stores in my area were open. Got to the door at Galashiels to be told that the store in only open till 12 on sat and sun night  this is an outrage and will not be shopping in any of your stores again  you should not advertise something as 24/7 if it isn t. Hope you get in touch with the store and get this problem sorted out  i did not only waste my time but also fuel driving down as don t want anyone else having the same problem as I had.

She s a regular customer of tesco! She came into one of your stores last week  bought some bits  one of the items was some cat litter! When she got home she realised that she had forgotten to pick the cat litter up! She had the receipt! She went back to the store and explained to customer service  where she spoke to a delightful individual who told her that unless the item had been handed in she couldn t have the cat litter! I should imagine it had just been put back on the shelf! It was only £3 or £4! But when she s a single mum  who struggles with the cost of living anyway?! I would have thought she would also be on the CCTV? I know it is used for shop lifters  and would have thought they could have also checked for things like this aswell?! I was just very disappointed to hear that no effort was actually made in helping her! After all  every little helps   well maybe not in this case?					2016-07-24T22:21:52+0000	1469398912	2016-07-25 00:21:52	5	6	5	0	11	6	6	0	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Less than a year ago I bought a double metal bed frame from tesco and tonight I am dismantling it as the frame has bent so badly its not repairable. Now  I am not a big lady at all  I am actually 5 3 and a professional dancers so no unusually excessive weight has been pressed upon the frame.   I am quiet upset as I just don t have another £200 for a bed frame this month but more upset that this bedframe didn t last a year! The quality of the product was not worth the money I paid for it. The frame I had before this one lasted 7 years and was still sold on and used.

That meant I could not get my prescription because they decided to shut up shop before the advertised time of 8pm. If you are going to advertise your services open till 8pm then that s when the store should close the tills. I had to get a bus to Tesco Shoreham which cost me money  so basically all because your shop assistants wanted to get off the job early I was left without medication for the evening 					2016-07-24T19:53:35+0000	1469390015	2016-07-24 21:53:35	0	7	0	0	7	7	4	3	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wondering if you could give me a bit of information on your age/identification requirements. I was trying to buy a pack of cigarettes today and was informed I d need to show ID. I informed the lovely checkout girl that I m 37  but dutifully showed my drivers licence however I was then informed that because my *30* year old friend didnt have ID with her we would not be able to purchase the cigarettes. Tell me  if I enter the store in the future with one of my children will I also be refused service (they are both under 13 and have neither driving licence  student card or passport) or should I play it safe and leave them unattended in the car-park?					2016-07-24T19:34:57+0000	1469388897	2016-07-24 21:34:57	2	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	7	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I came and picked up some red currants yesterday and today they are all mouldy (despite having tomorrows date). I mean I know fruit never lasts all too long but only a day? You know what lasts more than a day? Cake! But as I am trying to be all healthy I will stay strong and hopefully last the night out until your shop is back open.

Ref: 461219766  Customer: 81457646  I did my normal online grocery shop and it arrived on Friday 22nd  in the time slot it was ordered for. I bought some Beef Brisket (£7 per kilo) and the meat selected - according to my paper receipt - was £6.08  yet the price on the meat was £5.36.   And while we re at it  why do Tesco keep taking £2 out of my bank account on random (yet multiple) occasions for no reason? I seriously doubt Tesco would like it if I came in to one of their stores  paid 72p less than my bill was and then took random £2 coins out of the till. Before you ask  no I do not want to conduct this in a private message. You have my details  I await your reply.					2016-07-24T18:30:47+0000	1469385047	2016-07-24 20:30:47	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

First of all I opened a packet of peanut crunch fingers to find the grand total of 15 in there  not your fault I know  then  after salivating at the though all day  I ripped open my box of tesco s own maple ribs which promised a sachet of delicious sticky maple syrup to add to them.........no sachet! Never mind I ll force them down I m sure. I wonder if pancake maple syrup will taste the same? 🤔					2016-07-24T18:00:42+0000	1469383242	2016-07-24 20:00:42	1	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

At the front of your stores you have a fridge (sometimes even a double fridge) with a meal deal for £3 or less in it...if you fill these with items included in the meal deal it makes it a lot easier for customers to choose a delicious and well rounded lunch!   Rather then the experience I had today when purchasing 2 when you get to the till and find out it comes to £7.25 instead of £6 and having to hold the whole que (with lots of Tuts and huffs from other people) up by going back and trying to figure It out  as the items I picked were apparently not included in the deal even though placed on the shelf a with the relevant POS on the front of them.					2016-07-24T17:45:10+0000	1469382310	2016-07-24 19:45:10	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was so friendly and explained all the changes and short dated items to me. He then bought my shopping crates into the house and unpacked the bags onto my breakfast bar. All while he was chatting away to me. Nothing was too much trouble for him  he is an asset to your company. Thank you 😄👍					2016-07-24T15:30:28+0000	1469374228	2016-07-24 17:30:28	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had to drive back to the shop which was a real inconvenience to then just have the manager say  well you want another one then yeah  with no apology! I refused the option of another one firstly because the stench of the first one had point me off chicken but also because the juice from the chicken I had brought earlier was all over the fridge contaminating the other in date ones! After receiving my refund I asked the manager what their process is with sorting out of date produce and he just laughed! For there to have been an out of date chicken in the store nearly all day and none of the staff notice seems ridiculous especially being a small express store so you wouldn t think it would be too difficult to keep on top of it. I know these things happen but for something as dangerous as chicken (which if it weren t for the smell we may have eaten not realising) then for the manager to act like its normal and a bit of a joke with no apology  is a real disappointment. I shop in tesco (not this branch) almost every day and it has put me off future visits.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13729186_10153711018100808_5647253280483789705_n.jpg?oh=541fc7fc2b641bc20c92e1b05a73843a&oe=58DE2129	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13729186_10153711018100808_5647253280483789705_n.jpg?oh=abe0323c70245a8934f34c1291724ece&oe=58D9F224	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153711018100808&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-24T15:25:40+0000	1469373940	2016-07-24 17:25:40	5	12	9	0	21	12	6	6	8	0	4	1	2	0	0	1	0

We tried to find the rare and mystical chilli sauce  despite asking for help from three managers who just repeatedly said oh yes we have moved everything around to food worlds!! So it s in aisle 23 NO IT FECKIN ISNT!!! We spent a good 25 minutes searching for this rare beast. In the end at the point of my husbands head exploding we actually walked out. Yes we could have changed our meal plans but we wanted Chilli never before have I left a substantial trolley full of goods. We went to Moreisons in the end  think I ended up preferring it to be honest. Why would you do a store change a t a weekend  not provide adequate signage  or staff (who actually know where things have been moved to) even the manager agreed it was ridiculous after wondering around looking for this rare item!!					2016-07-24T13:41:41+0000	1469367701	2016-07-24 15:41:41	2	6	2	0	8	6	5	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today i went to purchase one after my kids wanted one. I got to the scan and it wouldn t scan. I got told I couldn t buy it because it wasn t on the system so wouldn t scan 😡 not being funny  these were on sale for weeks now so why not remove them from the shelves?

I purchased the new starwars dvd from the talbot green store about 2 weeks ago.  It was for my partners birthday today off our boys.  He put it on to watch  this afternoon  and there is a scratch on the disc and its freezing and jumping back  so we re watching the same scene over and over. After speaking to head office (as i have lost the receipt)  we were told to take the dvd to customer service and they would check that it was faulty and replace it.   We took it in  and was sent away again  as they said they dont even sell it there.  Ermmm they obviously do as i bought it there only 2 weeks ago.   We are now £13.00 down with a dvd that doesnt work and a very disappointed daddy.

Being a insulin dependant diabetic type 1 I needed to eat!! Stuck on the motor way in traffic I went to eat the wrap however looks the fly got there before me😷.

I have complained previously about staff members smoking next to the trolley parks at the front of store. Today I had to visit your store because netto wasn t open. Thankfully I didn t have my children with me as your staff - two members at around 12.00 were smoking in the same place as always. Clearly tesco are not taking this seriously.					2016-07-24T11:26:33+0000	1469359593	2016-07-24 13:26:33	1	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

I noticed some half price fineliners and picked a pack up along with another lady. She got to the till just before me and they scanned through higher than even the original price advertised. The checkout lady queried it with the manager who honoured it for the lady but refused my sale despite me being stood right behind her and chatting to her about the pens. I understand that it s not legal requiremt to honour the mistake but I think it s a poor display of customer service. 👎👎					2016-07-24T08:24:13+0000	1469348653	2016-07-24 10:24:13	1	5	1	0	6	5	4	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

OnlyTesco publishes their waste tonnage. All the others should too. Waste food going to landfill increases methane and therefore global warming. The Cooperatve in Glynneath is the ONLY supermarket that donates food to the apes and monkeys at the Sanctuary. The branch at Ystradgynlais used to until Tesco and Asda between them squeezed them out and they closed. Safeway also used to donate until Morrisons replaced them. So did Sommerfield donate. I have to say that the big supermarkets should be ashamed that they do not give waste fruit and vegetables to the animals.					2016-07-24T07:42:25+0000	1469346145	2016-07-24 09:42:25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Very disappointed to say the least  I had a cheese and ham sandwich and my nana had a sandwich too. Both our bread was stale  it was that hard I could actually hit it on the table and it sounded like a rock. My cheese was like eating a rubber band. After this we went down to the shop to get some food bits even though we d just had a bad experience in the cafe. We received very bad customer service when we asked a member of staff where an item was. She did not look at us once when we spoke to her and all she said was I don t know and turned her back on us and carried on working. I m sorry but I m sure customer service is a number one priority!! Not impressed at all!!					2016-07-23T22:37:30+0000	1469313450	2016-07-24 00:37:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I shopped in one of your stores in tidworth  with my husband and 6month old child  I have been a loyal customer aswell as working for tescos when I was 18years old.   On this afternoon my husband and I had done a big weekly shop  I was just about to set up onto a checkout when I remembered I had forgotten tin foil  with that I left my husband with our son and trolley to start placing the Iteams on the checkout. After eventually finding my product I made my way back to find half my shopping already scanned through while my husband was still trying to load. With this I asked your member of staff to stop until we were ready to pack. She informed me how she was proud to be a fast scanner and that tescos take pride in this. I went on to ask her would she had done this if my nan or even an older person had been at her checkout and her reply was no.   Sir  why does it make a difference with the fact that my husband is a young man? A father trying to entertain a baby aswell as load a checkout  aswell as pack?  Why should it matter how fast you can get your customers out the door even though you spend good money advertising to get them in?  Do you fill pleasure in a customer like myself leaving your store feeling more stressed then when I came in?  Having to take time to send an email asking you to slow down.  I hope you don t feel like this was a wasted email  this was from a young wife and mother trying to have an easy shopping trip.   Kind regards   Rachel wheeler					2016-07-23T22:23:55+0000	1469312635	2016-07-24 00:23:55	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Been a customer for a couple of years even though they charged more than some other companies but how they have just treated me I can t tell people enough to stay well away. I moved into a new house two weeks ago with a supposedly better postcode and car was going to be in the garage at night rather than outside. I called them as soon as we moved in to change my details and they said as it was a new build home there system hadn t been updated but they made a note and would honour my insurance they also said they would let me know when in 2 days when it s been resolved. Ok I thought fair enough  5 more days past nothing so I called and was told don t worry it s our fault not yours we sort it. Another 4 days past so I called and and was told I would be called back in a few days but not to worry as it was there fault not mine. Ok I said then on day 15 since I first called I was called by Tesco s and put on hold while customer services spoke to the underwriters. Then the lady told me we are cancelling my insurance as they can t find my address as its a new build. Now my address is the start of an 8 year 3000 new house development with a high street etc etc so I would have thought it wouldn t be too hard to find as Royal Mail got it straight away and I m sure Tesco will want a finger in that pie somewhere. Now I was given no grace time or anything they said that was it cancelled! Now moving is stressful enough let alone when your wife is due to give birth at anytime so obviously my car is extremely important right now  I told them this and they didn t give a monkeys  after pleading I managed to get my insurance until Monday! I asked about showing some loyalty to their customers and was told that s it! They kept saying from the start it was their fault and not to worry then after being strung along for over two weeks they just cancel it! I think it s absolutely disgusting And I hope people reading this will think twice about using such a tin pot company with no understanding or show no loyalty to there customers					2016-07-23T21:54:05+0000	1469310845	2016-07-23 23:54:05	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Surely the local Tesco supermarkets can do something to help all the people stuck on the roads into the ports? They could join forces with the authorities and provide some essential food and other things like nappies  wipes  antibacterial hand spray  with their delivery vans. I d be happy to forgo a scheduled delivery if it meant the van was helping those stranded and I m sure I m not alone.

After having spent an nearly an hour wondering about your Wells store to find a few items on my list  I have opted towards getting my shopping done at the local Morrisons tomorrow because at least I ll be able to fish in the fish aisle!!!					2016-07-23T20:20:51+0000	1469305251	2016-07-23 22:20:51	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I d sneakily handed a Peppa Pig soft toy back to her when we arrived at her checkout  apologising and saying that my son had carried it all the way round the shop but that I didn t actually want to buy it. He has the same one at home  so he thought it was his when we spotted it on the toy shelf and he wouldn t let it go. By the time we were at the till  he d dropped it so I handed it to Juli to put out of sight. When beeping through my items  Juli said hello and waved at my son. In response he growled and frowned angrily back at her. I said I was sorry about his reaction and told her not to take it personally as he has special needs  can t talk at all and is under assessment for autism. I explained that he struggles a lot when strangers talk to him or attempt to make any kind of contact - he doesn t like people invading his space without being invited and it can make him very upset. She said she understood and carried on chatting to me. My son was still looking annoyed  so she asked him if he d like Peppa. He is OBSESSED with Peppa Pig  so his face lit up at just hearing the word. She handed him the soft toy and said he could take it home and keep it forever  maybe as a spare for the car. He kept hold of it and has gone to bed with it tonight. Thank you Tesco  and thank you Juli for breaking the rules of  the norm  and making a very special child very  very happy 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13754204_10153998605959064_2114387482522909959_n.jpg?oh=075e5155e694d09004b1aeeb322178df&oe=5921F6A6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13754204_10153998605959064_2114387482522909959_n.jpg?oh=4ab21c5381a76e993b8bed3b565aa12b&oe=58DEF3AB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153998605959064&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-23T19:17:38+0000	1469301458	2016-07-23 21:17:38	2061	78	2225	134	2437	78	59	19	258	0	2041	159	3	1	0	0	0

Why oh why do you have parent and child spaces when you really couldn t care less who used them?  Now firstly I should probably apologise  as I m sure you are sick of seeing the same complaint from us lazy mothers time after time! But actually it s you that are missing the point (twice)... Firstly I don t mind if the spaces are the other end of your car park  I don t park there as its 2 minutes walk from your store. I park there to avoid a libel suit when my lovely little girl (who is 1) decides to do anything other than delicately slither out of her seat and carefully walk between the tiny orrifice which is the gap you allow between cars. Don t get me wrong  my daughter has never cried/kicked off/thrown a wobbly anywhere near your store  God forbid. But she still isn t delicate in her decent from her car seat. That s not to say she won t at some point though as that s just what kids do sometimes. But those parent and child spaces are a god send for us parents who don t care about the walk  but do want to care about other people s property. And here s the second point I mentioned earlier that you were missing... There s a lot of us mothers out there and we all feel the same! Give us those spaces and police them so they aren t miss-used and chances are we ll come flocking to your store  as Tesco  you aren t the only culprits. But if you actually marketed to us mothers  who use your stores frequently  and stood loud and proud against the others that only parents and babies can use those spaces  then your market share  your loss ratios  and your combined operating ratios (yes I actually know a little about this stuff) would look a lot more attractive. It s fairly simple  if you offer something  follow through. Hopefully next time I m at one of your stores I won t need a shoe horn to get me and my daughter out of our car as (from my last experience alone) a 25 year old man  40 something lady in gym gear  and someone with a BMW all decide to use them with their invisible children (I m sorry to generalise but just sighting what I saw!)... Shame on you!					2016-07-23T18:32:58+0000	1469298778	2016-07-23 20:32:58	9	15	9	0	24	15	9	6	11	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

While waiting to try her samples I could see that she was busy talking to a member of staff so I wandered to look at the price cut section and left my child waiting  they then took a bowl of popcorn each and walked over to me ( less than 2 meters away). My children are well mannered ( unlike this woman) who marched up  to me  They just took popcorn!  she shouted   I m sorry I thought they were samples  I said   they are but they need an adult  I replied that i dont eat popcorn that it would be for them and was only here anyway    it doesn t matter   I told her  fair enough  I wont be being any now- I noticed what I assumed to be  the  lady s  bank card on the floor  next to the stand and said   by the way your bank card is on the floor  -  its not even mine  she shouted with her bank to me. Her bad manners  tone of voice and general aggressive persona were extremely off putting and we left that section  and although I had intended to buy magazines from near her I felt too intimidated to go back to it.  You ought to vet the ppl who are hired for sampling  she has put me off this store Tesco and certainly off her products Walkers.					2016-07-23T18:04:55+0000	1469297095	2016-07-23 20:04:55	3	4	3	0	7	4	2	2	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I spoke to a staff on the first occasion who told me it didn t matter. I then asked him to go and check with a manager  he reappeared a minute later and dismissively said  Yea ok...  and removed the pork sausages from the general reduced section.   Yesterday same thing. This time I sought out the manager who assured me that this was unacceptable and it would never happen again and removed the pork sausages from the general reduced section.  TODAY! There was UNCOOKED chicken! In the general reduced section. At which point I left your store and will not be using it again. This kind of blatant disregard for food hygiene standards can kill and has KILLED IN THE PAST!  Please! Please! Do something about this before someone gets ill!

I have to complain very strongly about my visit to tescos at Pembury Kent today. Every year when we get hot weather the fridges and freezers at this store breakdown! It may only be two days of sunshine but sure as eggs are eggs down go the fridges. Today you have really exceled yourselves only a quarter of freezers were working and no chillers at all. This is totally unacceptable! I have been a loyal customer since this store first opened but you tested my patience to the full today! I have had to go to Asda and get all my chilled and frozen food. I do not appreciate having to go to two stores to get my weeks shopping. I suggest that you stop fiddling with your car park area and put money into reliable refrigeration! An apology to your staff would not go amiss either.l and every other customer today have been moaning and griping to them and I even offered to lay on a coach to take everyone to Asdas!

I know it s the start of penicillin  but I m feeling okay  so don t need an extra boost right now.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13754493_10154158156716084_5937884612801630152_n.jpg?oh=89b4040f1b8f3950e3c453c02fecf961&oe=58D99805	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13754493_10154158156716084_5937884612801630152_n.jpg?oh=2923ad25dc7612e039f05b5db532e0cd&oe=5923A908	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154158156716084&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-23T17:07:47+0000	1469293667	2016-07-23 19:07:47	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

The little boy had Down s syndrome and it was his dream to scan through and bag items on your checkouts  and the lady behind the till was amazing  he was on her knee and helped scan all the shopping  he was helping to bag things up  and when he was all finished  the cashier  a a manager and another colleague all have him a high five! I watched as the little boy ran back to his mum super happy  and the smile on his face spread from ear to ear. I really think the lady on the checkout needs calling out as we need more people like this in the world. Making children s dreams come true no matter how small! Thank you tesco for restoring my faith in humanity after such a horrible year!					2016-07-23T16:53:13+0000	1469292793	2016-07-23 18:53:13	2306	112	2532	235	2879	110	78	32	235	0	2280	211	9	3	0	0	0

Today i purchased 2 items from your Bakery section at Tesco Metro  St Albans  Hertfordshire. The first was a pack of 2 pain au raisin. They were very heavy & stodgy  & only had a total of 7 raisins in the one that was eaten. The second pack was the pastry plait with pecan nuts topping & apple filling. Well  again - heavy/stodgy & only 1/4 was actually filled with apple!  I m not sure who was in charge of baking the products today  but they were not as tasty as when previously purchased - so much so that 1 from each pack was thrown away.  Not happy at all... look forward to hearing your comments. Jessica Eddowes					2016-07-23T16:51:27+0000	1469292687	2016-07-23 18:51:27	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of your assistants came up and asked is mum ok? Do you need some help? I said I was fine and could manage. She said please come and ask us if you need any help getting your shopping today. Just wanted to say how lovely and welcomed it was  any mum whose little one has had a breakdown in the supermarket knows how I would of been feeling right then and a few kinds words offering help were much appreciated. Saw same lady later helping a disabled lady and her career get their shopping to the car. Good job tesco!

I didn t realise there was a 2 hour limit to parking in your section of the car park. The ticket states my duration was 3 hours 58 minutes  and consequently  I have been instructed to pay a fine of £70  (or reduced  to a rate of £40 if paid within 14 days).  Being a  valued customer  as stated in your own accompanied Tesco headed letter  I was wondering how many points I would add to my Tesco club card if I chose to pay this fine to Highview Parking  or as I like to refer to them corporate extortionists acting on behalf of Tesco? I suppose with spending £150 a week on groceries  around £200 a week on petrol/diesel  banking with you  having insurance policies with you  and having purchased tv s  laptops  and mobile phones with contracts  what s an extra £40  (£20 per hour parking)  reduced rate  or £70  (£35 per hour parking)  normal rate???  Every little helps  who? Tesco? Must be you  because it certainly isn t me. So this  Valued Customer  will now be cancelling phone contracts  closing accounts with Tesco Bank  buying insurance elsewhere  renewing technology elsewhere and spending £7500 on groceries  £10 000 on petrol/diesel in Asda  where I will pat my backside just like the advert  with the satisfaction of not giving you so much as 5p for a bag. As for your fine  and as a Glaswegian  you can whistle for it!!!!					2016-07-23T14:12:52+0000	1469283172	2016-07-23 16:12:52	7	8	8	1	17	8	3	5	5	0	7	1	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered tesco groceries delivery to get a call that there s not enough money on my account to pay for the order (even though I specifically left more money than needed for the shopping) -  only to find out that the original price of my shopping went up £20!!! after tesco added their costs or something. And this is not the first time it happened. I understand £2-£3 difference  but £20!!! It s ridiculous! For that difference I can shop somewhere better. Will be cancelling my delivery saver today as I don t think I ll be ordering from you again. Planning my family budget and spending £150 on average each week for groceries I expect prices to not be raised £2o over a night! And yes  you totally ruined our barbecue plans for tomorrow.

The landlady of the property kindly opened the house up for the driver :) when we got here  we were very pleasantly surprised that the driver had gone above and beyond and actually put our refrigerated and frozen items away for us - an absolute life saver  that certainly went above and beyond - thank you!

Yesterday our 5 year old son needed emergency medical attention. While we waited for an ambulance the staff helped keep my son cool and cared for  brought blankets to shade him  brought water for him and his twin brother. They even gave his twin brother a set of toy cars to keep him distracted and an ice cream to keep him happy. All this they did with absolute kindness  and the man who made our boy the ice cream made him laugh amidst it all.  They helped keep a highly stressful situation calm.  Our son is now ok and home. We are SO thankful to you all. What a fantastic team and credit to Tesco you are.					2016-07-23T09:41:45+0000	1469266905	2016-07-23 11:41:45	195	9	203	22	234	9	8	1	12	0	194	7	1	0	0	0	0

Made online order yesterday  paid for the bill and less than 1hr hour until my delivery today I get a phone call to tell me that  sorry deliver can t be carried out because of an accident that happened early this afternoon and there s nothing you can do for you. And also it can take up to 5days to give your money back   I didn t ask for a refund  you Tesco decided to issue a refund and leave me without the money and shopping when I have guests arriving today. Thank you for a truly appalling customer service and simply leaving a customer without the money and without the shopping. I asked the very polity supervisor why can t I go and get the shopping from my local tesco and whatever I can t buy I can then get a refund. The answer: we can t do that because tesco already actioned the refund (which I didn t asked for at any point) and because of internal policies we can t do that.  Tesco  why do you forget about customer at the time you fail them and simply don t find any viable options! You had my money  you let me down and now I m left with no money and no shopping!! It isn t good enough  I guess you are not that bothered anymore to lose customer because you have just lost another household.					2016-07-22T19:52:29+0000	1469217149	2016-07-22 21:52:29	2	7	2	0	9	7	3	4	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

As we got out of the car  my son fell and hurt both his knees quite badly. I took him into the store to get some tissue from the toilets  but they weren t in use.  I asked a member of staff if they could grab me some  instead he sent me a first aider who cleaned my son s knees and put plasters on them. My son was quite upset and in shock so the man gave him a toy to cheer him up!  I was then asked if i needed help with my shopping!  I was amazed with the care and consideration they gave to my son. I want to thank them again for their help and great kindness. THANK YOU! 👍😊					2016-07-22T19:16:11+0000	1469214971	2016-07-22 21:16:11	215	12	215	15	242	12	5	7	5	0	211	0	0	0	0	0	0

My wife noticed that the coconut oil she normally buys had increased in price by 50 PERCENT -FIFTY PERCENT!! What is Tesco playing at and how can they justify extortion such as this. While it might be understandable for items to increase in price it is not understandable that prices can be hiked by such a high level increase. When expressing her concern to the manager my wife came away with a take it or leave it feeling  as prices do go up. Tesco are forever advertising customer care And bending over backwards to keep the customer happy attitude  and really should look at my wife s experience to day as   an example of bad service and NO care.					2016-07-22T18:57:04+0000	1469213824	2016-07-22 20:57:04	2	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having posted on here several times in the past few years  about the shocking level of customer service in your Starbeck tesco express store  I m delighted to let you know that since I moved to knaresborough  the coop garage shop just down the road from me  has regularly exhibited world class  slowness  at serving customers. I think even the guys at your Starbeck store would be stunned by this  and that s saying something.  Anyway  I just felt it was only fair to let you know that I no longer consider your Starbeck store to be the worst shop I ve ever been in. 👍					2016-07-22T18:53:30+0000	1469213610	2016-07-22 20:53:30	3	8	4	0	12	8	6	2	3	0	3	0	0	1	0	0	0

One month old and the block has exploded on the third cut ever of my grass. And yes all the correct lubricants were added to the correct levels before you ask. Really hope nobody gets  seriously hurt using this lawnmower. One piece of shrapnel flew five metres about the size of a fifty pence piece. I ve added photos below.

I recently placed an order online for the popular board game   Trivial Pursuit - Family Edition  I feel you may have take the  pursuit  part far too literally. I ll explain the reason for purchasing this item. My oldest son (4) starts school soon  and as educational as  jake and the neverland pirates  are along with  doc mcstuffins   I thought a bit of mental stimulation was in order to keep his active mind ticking over. Now comes the fun part. On Wednesday the 20th of July I ordered said game  for next day collection in the local Arbroath store  however it was not sent for collection for the following day  so I spoke to a kind person on your customer service line who apologised and refunded my delivery charge  and chucked in an extra £5 for the delay  thanks for that. Now we get to today (Friday) the extra £5 was already spent in my head for snacks to accompany the game  that my husband and I were a tad excited to play this evening  along with our oldest. It would be harsh of me at this point to compare your delivery skills to that of a Ryan air pilot  who somehow land at the wrong airport from time to time  but you managed to send my game  which at this point can only be compared to the likes of the quest for the holy grail. Back to the matter in hand  you sent my game for collection in Perth  a mere 40 miles away an 80 mile round trip. The customer service in store informed me that they could not get the item delivered for collection until Monday! That s pretty poor  so yes I did take a refund.. you may be asking yourself what are they going to do without trivial pursuit on a Friday night? That question has yet to be answered Tesco  I would say my night is ruined but I live life on the edge and have a pack of playing cards. I found the game online from a company that will remain nameless  that deliver tomorrow. Until next time. Good evening.					2016-07-22T17:18:20+0000	1469207900	2016-07-22 19:18:20	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were all set to go when  kids being kids  she broke her arm so we had to postpone. Lauren one of Tesco s social media hosts contacted me a few weeks ago and asked me how our day out went? I told her about Scarlett s disappointment and that we ll probably go later in the year. Today I got a message from Lauren to go to our local Tesco Express in Ainsdale and pick up a load of gifts to make up for the disappointment. Needless to say Scarlett is delighted with the books  DVDs and snuggly cushion and blanket.

He has to wear glasses as his eyesight is very poor but the mask that is sold along with the costume is very fitted and made of hard plastic which means he either has to take his glasses off to wear the mask (which results in a lot of bumping into doors etc!) or he can not wear the mask at all.  I was wondering if Tesco produce the costumes or do they come from an external supplier as im sure im not the only mum who has this problem and i would like to highlight this issue.  Many thanks.					2016-07-22T16:08:47+0000	1469203727	2016-07-22 18:08:47	3	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got it home put it in the garden sat my two year old on it and the material ripped. I did a quick fix not wanting to go all the way to larkfield to resolve this problem. Over the past three days it has now ripped another three times.

Couldn t download fifa  checked box and it said it expired at end of June. Contacted customer services  they credited my card with £35 so I could purchase the game. Fair enough  son was very disappointed but I said we d go to buy the game.  Called tesco for stock check at Sunderland extra store  told they had 4 in stock  drove down with soaking wet hair as trying to get ready for sons birthday meal to be told that have none in stock and that the four are probably faulty ones returned over time. So I ve now had to drive further to a sainsburys and paid £40 just for my son to be able to play a game on his xbox one on his birthday. I fully understand mistakes can happen but twice in the same day to the same customer is extremely unfortunate and the fact it has impacted my son on his birthday is awful.					2016-07-22T14:32:59+0000	1469197979	2016-07-22 16:32:59	0	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0

I had a delivery slot from 1-2 by 2.15 nothing i rang your head office to which i was told that there was a note on the system to say unable to deliver. Well thats odd as i have been waiting in and no calls to my mobile number and no one turned up. Now the road near to me is Hawkins Road similar to Hawkins Crescent but dont your drivers have sat navs how did he possibly get the wrong road? And all previous drivers have called me when there are issues perhaps this particular driver wanted to clock off early on a Friday... having to wait till 4.30 for my delivery as it includes items I need before the end of the day for my children. Noone really seemed overally bothered by the hassle this has caused. I use you every week and have delivery saver every month. This is how you loose customers.					2016-07-22T14:28:41+0000	1469197721	2016-07-22 16:28:41	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Not one of them was edible and I had to throw them all out.

Middlebrook branch. My daughter slipped and fell and jarred her back. She was in pure agony and screaming. The first aider was there in seconds and then the manager came over to see what had happened.  Luckily now my daughter is fine.  Made better with the packet of chewits and the little toy she was given.

I wanted 2 bikes for my sons birthday  which i paid for in full only to have my order cancelled 3 days later due to them not being in stock  then when i got my money back and reordered them after calling customer service to see if they were in stock  the order was cancelled due to a safty concern. 3 more days and and extra 75 pounds for bikes from amazon and express delivery ... i had bikes  first time  no problems ... shame you couldnt manage that! Then i order some hedge trimmers monday  only to have someone call from customer service today (friday!!!) to cancel my order ... seriously ... how many millions of pounds is tesco worth  ill go down my local shop and get some  but again it will cost me more! I will not be ordering anything from you again  and i will urge my friends and family not to order from you either!  I just sent this email to them  and i urge anyone not to buy from them online! absolutely shocking!					2016-07-22T12:11:27+0000	1469189487	2016-07-22 14:11:27	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

So was very surprised to find that when I inflated it  it was patched where it has previously been ripped. I don t think I should have paid full price for a second hand product.  I just want to ask why I have paid full price for a product that has been ripped  repaired and used.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13769588_1167482879938656_1505263793779228044_n.jpg?oh=5c99507188878ad3b65631f9c8d135c6&oe=58DDDF9A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13769588_1167482879938656_1505263793779228044_n.jpg?oh=42751db39a9e2e0cfef72352deeb7c93&oe=5920078F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1167482879938656&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-22T09:37:29+0000	1469180249	2016-07-22 11:37:29	5	2	7	0	9	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	2	0	0	0	0

Got a voucher valid until 31 July for £2 off any Charlie Bigham s ready meal for two.  I went to two of the largest stores in Edinburgh to find there was none in stock and none of the five members of staff I spoke to had heard of Charlie Bigham.  After I e-mailed Tesco I got a phone call to say that they were discontinuing that line and once they were gone they were gone. Small print says   subject to availability and where stocked  .  It s time these large retailers started treating customers ( and their staff for that matter ) with more respect.					2016-07-22T08:01:25+0000	1469174485	2016-07-22 10:01:25	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had purchased some of your baby wipes which had caused my son the most horrific  burn  type rash. (Due to the area of the burn I ve chosen not to include this picture). The wipes had a very strong smell that I can only describe as bleach. The lady behind the customer service desk  Mandy  was the most helpful person I ve ever dealt with. She took the pack of wipes  all my details and said that head office would test the wipes and be in touch.... So yesterday  I went to the same store to pick up my click and collect  and Mandy was there. She advised me that my wipes were still in store (this is 3 weeks later and I could visibly see the wipes from where I was standing) and that no one had been to collect as head office had previously advised they would. That s when I went home to receive a letter stating that you  Tesco  had received a full report on these wipes and that they were fit for use.... FIT FOR USE  THEY HAVEN T EVEN BEEN TESTED! The store manager in Welshpool had a look at your letter and said it seemed very generic and we (3 of your employees and a manager) were all gobsmacked in your attempt to shut me up with a £15 gift card. I wonder how many people you ve done this to? How many people have you  fobbed off  with a gift card? Had I not seen the wipes I never would have known. I hope people see this post  and realise what a disgrace you are as a company. I now have the wipes back in my possession and you  Marc Bowick  will be hearing from me directly.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13710018_1740777162831468_3136453473427182492_n.jpg?oh=faeecd0cac05afdeffca5fa64bdd4167&oe=591D9CEB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13710018_1740777162831468_3136453473427182492_n.jpg?oh=2e9b8431fc81edb011ca3e0af1e7af07&oe=5920A7FE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1740777162831468&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-22T06:48:21+0000	1469170101	2016-07-22 08:48:21	25	53	25	53	131	53	28	25	32	0	25	0	0	0	0	0	0

So we have an agreement  with the Manager of Tescos at the Ewell petrol station that nothing gets moved in the Esso Training School car park until at least 07.30 and  preferably  08.00 and not after 22.00.  So  it is 07.01 in the morning and the movement of trolleys wakes us up.  This is after someone doing the same thing at 06.54 last Sunday that resulted in my going round to the garage and politely reminding the Team Leader on duty of the agreement.  Is it fair that neighbours should be disturbed at unsocial hours by staff who clearly disregard their Manager s instructions?  Oh I forgot to mention - my wife is suffering from terminal cancer and needs all the rest she can get!!!!!  Tesco - you really need to sort yourselves out!!   Your Customer Care people responded quickly and the matter seemed to be resolved.  This morning at 7.24am I took the video attached and am  as they say  none too pleased.  I have another example at 7.26am.  PLEASE can you sort this out as it is causing unnecessary distress at a what is a difficult time anyway.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/13697511_10210598978199006_75612939_n.jpg?oh=c35357a45504a42e1c8be109f04f7a9c&oe=58DAA950	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/13697511_10210598978199006_75612939_n.jpg?oh=e672428a857b02c0c3748b25bcb80bc8&oe=58E9C965	https://www.facebook.com/10210406169418907/videos/10210598966318709	facebook.com	2016-07-22T06:36:11+0000	1469169371	2016-07-22 08:36:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sadly my dad passed away on 17/7 but i know it meant alot to him that someone  out of the loop  had the time to bother for him and for that i am so grateful  Megan you are a superstar.					2016-07-21T23:40:02+0000	1469144402	2016-07-22 01:40:02	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son (17 - and his first job interview) was invited to an interview for a new phone shop coming to our local Tesco.  He had the interview on the 1st of June and completed the right to work etc.  He was told that he would receive a confirmation on his success or not within 2 weeks - that was nearly 8 weeks ago!  We have emailed the person three different times with no response.  The online application remains still  in review .  We have contacted the store themselves and they have not been able to resolve this  with their emails not being responded to either.  We know that the email address for the person conducting the interviews is correct as he initially responded with the right to work link.  I m sure that this is not the level of service Tesco expects from their staff and would appreciate a response to his application especially since he was assured he would be told even if he did not get the job.  He has been waiting in limbo for all this time as this is really the job he wants.					2016-07-21T23:29:14+0000	1469143754	2016-07-22 01:29:14	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My husband  myself and our 4yr old son  were shopping in the Bulwell store in Nottingham. Two weeks ago  my husband suffered a severe back injury  which has left him barely able to move  and in a lot of pain  with a lot of medications. Today was the first day my husband has left the house in the past two weeks  except for hospital and doctors appointments. He has been very fed up  and wanted to do something  normal  We had reserved a stores mobility scooter for my husband to use  my husband had barely managed to get from the car park  to the actual store doors  using his crutches  so i d gone upstairs to get the scooter for him. As we went around the store  my husband was feeling more unwell  and in a lot of pain and discomfort  he had taken some of his pain meds  but i was quite concerned how he was looking  the battery was running low on the scooter  so my husband made his way back to the customer service desk  whilst i quickly finished our shopping at the checkout with our son. Rachel Morris had seen my husband in obvious pain  and had been asking him if he was ok  or needed a drink or anything   and when i got there she was very concerned asking me if he was ok  and i said no  not really  My husband was barely able to move  without severe pain  and there was no way he d be able to manage his crutches to leave the store. My 4yr old was also playing up as he was fed up and cranky  but Rachel was very helpful  and got a trolley with a large wheelchair seat attached  and offered to take my husband down to the car park. She was chatty and friendly  and bubbly  my husband has been feeling very demoralised  going from a very active man  to being totally dependent  and had been feeling humiliated  and suffering anxiety  about his limited mobility. Rachel treated my husband with wonderful care respect and good humour  making him laugh  even as she struggled to push him in the chair trolley. Her warmth and caring was truly lovely  after a very stressful day. When i thanked her  she said she was just doing her job  but she did so much more than that  she helped us in a practical way  but more importantly  in a caring and compassionate way! Tesco should be extremely proud to have such a wonderful lady on their staff! Much Thanks  from Lizz  Dave  and little Jacob! xxx					2016-07-21T22:46:46+0000	1469141206	2016-07-22 00:46:46	63	39	73	2	114	39	28	11	25	0	62	9	1	0	0	0	0

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  We request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows. Otherwise we will have little alternative but to register a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.

I have tried to return to the store but they are denying all knowledge and saying I cannot return it.    I am not happy at all and I demand you take action otherwise I m going to the papers and I will be left with no other choice but to have my photo in the press showing my best compo face.  Kindest regards   Me!  *legs it off to practice her compo face*  Ps I am obviously after compensation for the my emotional upset and distress and as such I will accept nothing less than a jumbo packet of MilkyBar Buttons if I have to keep this unwanted faulty purchase as I reckon it will be the only thing that will keep it quiet.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13775937_10154328921998744_6688596526459375549_n.jpg?oh=f2da1b62fea3d78f4124228bffc43795&oe=58DA2A82	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13775937_10154328921998744_6688596526459375549_n.jpg?oh=cd4b7f66c8eae14dcf9a065634e025e1&oe=591EAB8F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154328921998744&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-21T21:12:51+0000	1469135571	2016-07-21 23:12:51	9	17	15	2	34	16	5	11	34	0	9	0	0	6	0	0	0

I have attached a picture of the sausages and my receipt which shows the date I bought them and the use by date on the packet. I would appreciate a message in return.

She is always pleasant and more than happy to give advice  as she did on Monday morning when my daughter was really poorly. This lady was also brilliant when my dad was ill and ordered his medication and food replacement drinks exactly when he needed them. Fantastic service wouldn.t go anywhere else.					2016-07-21T20:09:10+0000	1469131750	2016-07-21 22:09:10	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It arrived Wednesday. (Not next day!)   It arrived damaged and unusable - I sent pictures to tesco direct who confirmed the faults and that a replacement would given.   I came to the Coulby Newham store to ask for a refund in order to buy a laptop in working order from your store.   I WAS REFUSED A REFUND or EXCHANGE.   I have a receipt of sale with tesco and was told I cannot have a refund as the member of staff couldn t confirm if the item was faulty. I took copies of all email exchanges with tesco direct.   Completely appalled by your customer service.   I have asked tesco direct how I receive a refund or exchange and have had no reply.   Why are you making this matter so difficult and time consuming to resolve!   In short I ordered a next day delivery item on Monday  it arrived late  it s broken  I ve wasted my time trying to return it to store and am no closer to having a working laptop!   Help?!!!					2016-07-21T19:57:00+0000	1469131020	2016-07-21 21:57:00	0	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

You told me you couldn t get me a replacement which was disappointing in itself. I asked for a refund as it broke and is faulty. You said you would send me a money cars with £15 on which is the value of the bath seat. You told me it could take 10 working days. 10 working days passed. I messaged you. You said you would get back to me. You haven t. I messaged you again. You haven t replied!  So you sold me a faulty bath seat  I took it back the store kept it for me ( they still have it). The store rung me and said they had one in. I went to the store and they gave me a potty ( it was a mix up but I had to travel to the store with two babies in the pouring rain to find they had got mixed up)  you promised a money card  it s not turned up  you haven t replied to my messages. Really really disappointed. I m left with no bath seat  no money  wasted journey and unanswered messages. Sort it out tesco!					2016-07-21T19:52:24+0000	1469130744	2016-07-21 21:52:24	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got to the checkout to pay and I had some bags of £1 coins I needed to get rid of so I tried to pay using them  they asked if I had any notes (I didn t as I didn t have my purse). They refused to accept the coins! I normally let things go but I was so annoyed at having spent over half an hour going round with two babies. I went to asda this afternoon and paid with the £1 coins there and they were lovely!					2016-07-21T19:09:16+0000	1469128156	2016-07-21 21:09:16	0	6	4	0	10	6	4	2	4	0	0	0	1	0	2	1	0

I purchased a 4 pint bottle of blue milk (picture below) from your main Tesco store in Bury St Edmunds on Saturday with an expiry date of 25 July 2016. The bottle was opened on Monday evening for my daughter who is 16 months old. I ve just made her bedtime bottle and the milk had curdled and came out in huge lumps! She has had that milk already today and now I m worried that she is going to become very ill!! I am so angry that I have stored and used this product safely and this is the result! I ve had to throw away the remainder of the milk and drag my daughter to a local shop at this time of night to purchase more milk so that she can have her bedtime bottle. NOT what I expect from Tesco  wholly disappointed.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13781962_10155188405906164_6393422024722305345_n.jpg?oh=d1abf79bda792cc1bedd5c99bfccd890&oe=59209614	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13781962_10155188405906164_6393422024722305345_n.jpg?oh=97d7813ca3fa8a4df7ac87f0a0044207&oe=58D5F319	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155188405906164&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-21T19:04:00+0000	1469127840	2016-07-21 21:04:00	1	11	1	3	15	11	6	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have now enjoyed them for the last few months for our weekly  non-takeaway  treat.   Please can I just point out the substantial inconsistency in the seasoning that is applied to the fries. Now I must admit that I am somewhat a wimp when it comes to any spice or heat in food and acknowledge that these do have a  seasoned coating . However  I have eaten and enjoyed them for a few months without any issue.   The fries we have eaten tonight as a family seem to have had a bucket of cayenne pepper thrown at them. After one fry  my mouth was on fire - however  as admitted I AM a wimp. My other son also thought they were very hot and he will eat mild curries. My husband said that there was rather a bit of a kick to them and he will win challenges with his friends eating birds eye chillies!!  Please can you make your products more consistent in future so I know what will blow my mouth off or not. I guess I m going to have to go back to boring McCain home fries again to be on the safe side. :(	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13680906_10153927561923198_3488922088789079646_n.jpg?oh=b7f0d132dbbb88153b35cc3f0bcc4f9b&oe=58EA4F0B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13680906_10153927561923198_3488922088789079646_n.jpg?oh=b847b544a643193d4a607afadf776ae3&oe=58ED2F06	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153927561923198&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-21T18:35:07+0000	1469126107	2016-07-21 20:35:07	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last Tuesday I booked a delivery between 8-9pm which did not turn up. I called Tesco at 9.30pm to find out what happened  they told me the delivery was an hour and 20mins delayed and will be with me at 10.20pm. At quarter to 11 I called them to find out it was not coming at all.   I have a two year old who is poorly. I had only waited till 11pm for his milk and breakfast for the morning. I live in the middle of know where and know transport of my own  hence getting it delivered. I had to take my son out really early in the morning to walk a mile to the nearest shop for food.  I was given two options over the phone to one have it ordered for the morning but they would have to charge me £45.37 again as refunds take 3-5 working days  or cancel the order and again wait 3-5 days for it to be returned in my bank. I did not have £46 spare in my bank to order it again. Silly policy.  I was extremely annoyed but thought I have never had a problem like this with them before. Although my mum has had a fair few times. I ordered my shopping again due today. Tesco had given me £25 in vouchers for the inconvenience so I use them for the re-order of the exact same shop.   I have just checked my bank and the refund for the previous order of £45.37 was put back  but then I noticed £47.37 had been taken out by Tesco instead of the £25.37 it should be.   What is going on? I have been so patient and understanding that mistakes do happen but this now is just incompetence. I have been a Tesco customer for many years as I believe they are better than the other supermarkets in price and quality  but this is beyond a joke.					2016-07-21T17:19:47+0000	1469121587	2016-07-21 19:19:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Loaded it THREE times and  Joanne  from  Customer Services  at Tesco seems to follow in the way of their 0330 telephone line protocol. If they can t be genuinely bothered then it appears easier to DELETE the message or hang up the phone. I ve re-read the follow-up question I sent. It wasn t rude  It was polite. I said thank you.

Everything was carefully packed and all items present and correct (well done in store pickers!) But what was most impressive was the impeccable customer service given by the driver (I m sure his name was Andy) when he dropped it off! As it was my first delivery he explained everything I needed to know and he was incredibly friendly  knowledgeable and really seemed to love his job and interacting with customers. I ll definitely be using this service again- your Yeovil store always provide great customer service and I hope this message reaches them.					2016-07-21T14:08:38+0000	1469110118	2016-07-21 16:08:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I live in First Avenue across the road from the Tesco Express Store and am angered at the scant disregard you afford the people who live in First Avenue.  I note another post from the 11th July (now removed by you) also highlighting the problem of rubbish that blows into First Avenue from your bins and that dropped by your customer base.    You will find that attached to your planning conditions for the store that Tesco is duty bound to address the issue of rubbish.   As you have not addressed this worsening waste issue I am currently in conversation with the local press who are keen to do a storey about the problem as it now becoming worse by the day.     The waste blows up and down our First Avenue and is not collected by those that owe a duty of care to the residents of the immediate area.  Your store makes considerable profits from this location so I cannot see why money cannot be spent on keeping our street clean. We have the right to live in a neighbourhood that is free from rubbish and noise and Tesco has a duty to deliver this on the back of the large profits it makes from those that shop there.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13718604_10153543930702531_3333873988978778604_n.jpg?oh=730475b2da3f09304ecedeeef7bc35c0&oe=58DB921A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q83/s720x720/13718604_10153543930702531_3333873988978778604_n.jpg?oh=c2908a16498f67c7e3145f4e58bf737f&oe=58D78257	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153543930702531&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-21T11:33:25+0000	1469100805	2016-07-21 13:33:25	7	14	7	3	24	12	3	9	1	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

They re tasty  the right consistency and the flavour is awesome. (I know you re expecting a but  and there is one) But  the packaging  although i love the retro design and the spoon scraping along it reminds me of a street band i heard in South Africa  it is really difficult to get all of the soya goodness form out of the grooves. I tried using my tongue but a) that looked really bad on the train. and b) i could only get 1/3rd of it licked. I also tried a finger  which was a little bit more successful but as i licked 2ml of blueberry from my finger for the second time the man sat opposite me on the train stood up and went to sit somewhere else. The only solution i have managed is to add some hotwater and make a blueberry soya yoghurt tea  but i did not enjoy it and I was also told I could not plug my kettle in on the train.  Is there a reason for this specific design and would there be any hope of it changing?					2016-07-21T10:43:31+0000	1469097811	2016-07-21 12:43:31	29	10	39	1	50	9	3	6	44	0	28	1	0	9	0	0	0

The order was cancelled 20hrs after being ordered which in itself is frustrating  lying to customers by saying stuff is in stock when it isn t. Now I have checked my credit card statement and noticed I am still yet to be refunded.

Last night I spent three hours trying to do my shop online as both my sons are to ill to take out  after trying to put in my card details a dozen times I rang them to be to told the website was down and basically tough I wouldn t be getting my shopping today  strong worded email sent and I decided to try tesco. The website was easy to use  was very informative about what the dates of the food would be like.

Could you please explain to me why I was refused service at your extra store on new Bailey street  Manchester at 22:57 when it lists its closure as 11pm. I work in a customer facing role and after finishing my shift and rushing to grab some necessities. I am more than confident that I would have been able to make my purchases within the given time I had with no hindrance to the stores timely closure. I look forward to reading your thoughts on this matter and the convenience your teams slack timekeeping has imposed on me.

The black filth in crevices where floor meets tiles  around and under washbasins and loo  well just anywhere where dirt can collect  it makes your skin crawl with unease at the germs that are lurking there. My plea: PLEASE have the restrooms DEEP cleaned/steam cleaned. I think a store which sells produce we consume  should have the highest standard of cleanliness in their restrooms.					2016-07-20T19:11:15+0000	1469041875	2016-07-20 21:11:15	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been into the store and their response was nothing they could do as they don t have security cameras in the car park. Someone has basically stolen food out of my children s bellies. I m appalled there s no cameras in the car park area and appalled that tesco Pembroke docks response was  nothing they can do  I do not want this happening to someone else who might have spent the last of their money to feed their children and now be left with nothing!					2016-07-20T18:55:30+0000	1469040930	2016-07-20 20:55:30	0	4	0	0	4	3	3	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was asked for ID which I didn t have because 1) I m 31  2) I m 25 weeks pregnant therefore not drinking alcohol  3) I wasn t paying therefore didn t have my purse and 4) it s non-alcoholic. My boyfriend who is 33 had ID but this wasn t enough because I didn t have ID. We also has regular cider in the trolley for my boyfriend and I can understand not being allowed to buy that if we can t prove who it s for but to refuse non-alcoholic drinks? I m really confused. On your website it doesn t have alcohol in the ingredients yet it s included in the licensing laws yet the shandy you sell beside the soft drinks has  beer  included in the ingredients but is free for anyone to buy. I ve checked Asda and Sainsbury’s and they don t appear to restrict the sale of this cider to over 18s.   My boyfriend is wondering if he would have had the same issue had he been with his daughter. At what point is it acceptable to refuse the sale when the accompanying person doesn t have ID?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13775584_10153614032435863_6407331968782180602_n.jpg?oh=c4e5a29cc2c27d7415b14771f115e627&oe=58E00ADE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13775584_10153614032435863_6407331968782180602_n.jpg?oh=27c90a381c0363c06ea96a29566daeb5&oe=58E6ECD3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153614032435863&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-20T18:11:55+0000	1469038315	2016-07-20 20:11:55	7	29	11	2	42	29	9	20	12	0	7	0	4	0	0	0	0

On arrival i noticed all the freezers were empty because of  technical difficulties . Although there was a sign saying to ask if you wanted a specific item as they had been put in the back fridges. So i asked for some ice cream only to be told it had all melted before the transfer. I asked when the fridges were to be mended to be told  i have no idea .  If such a problem occurs  can t you advertise it on social media to avoid such a long trip in sweltering heat and also to come back empty handed???					2016-07-20T17:55:07+0000	1469037307	2016-07-20 19:55:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Barely one slice of cheese  and not enough pickle to wet the bread.  Quality of products is declining almost week on week (ready meals especially)  will not be buying anymore ready made food from any Tesco stores. Disgusting  and sadly commonplace.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13669580_10154239697351745_1869356345816781256_n.jpg?oh=a0c9a7de5e9e0f2229b7b4fb7e9d21ca&oe=591F5CAA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/13669580_10154239697351745_1869356345816781256_n.jpg?oh=a6ff4452a2970f714e82e4da9a406670&oe=58E6675F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154239697351745&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-20T17:42:39+0000	1469036559	2016-07-20 19:42:39	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently noticed customers at one of your stores leaving their dogs in cars in the scorching sunshine. I discussed this with the store manager and suggested that some posters at the entrance  promoting customers to give this some thought  might be appropriate. I even supplied him with several ofiicial RSPCA posters. He replied that he needed to speak to  head office  before he did this  and so far nothing has been done.  I think that you (Tesco) could and should take a responsible stance on this. I know that the good weather is good for your business  but surely a dead dog in a car in your car park  surrounded by police  RSPCA staff  public and the dogs owner isn t!?  I am struggling to think of a good reason why your store manager would have been refused permission from his superiors.					2016-07-20T16:59:22+0000	1469033962	2016-07-20 18:59:22	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited the store earlier today with my parents and sister. When we were in the refrigerated section there was a large milk spillage in the aisle with NO WET FLOOR SIGN. My dad turned the corner into the aisle and slipped on the spillage  falling and hitting the full length of the left side of his body.  Whilst customers gathered around to help my dad up and make sure he was alright  I went to get two male members of staff named Jason and Leigh who were decidedly less concerned about my dad. They took their time to even come to the aisle and neither asked my dad if he was ok. They did get a gentleman to come and mop the floor and put a wet floor sign down  which he then removed without even fully mopping up the spill! Neither Leigh nor Jason spoke to us at all after I had alerted them  and even when I told them they just said  “oh  sorry.” I was angry about this and mentioned to another member of staff that nobody had offered to even record what had happened  so he asked if I wanted to speak to a manager and went to get one. The manager who came to us made us wait about 5 minutes with nobody offering my dad a seat or checking if he needed anything. The manager was called Jamie and was the dairy  meat and poultry manager. I was understandably upset at the treatment so far and when I tried to express this he cut me off saying  “I’m just here to help.” He did not immediately ask if my dad was ok  and I had to again ask him if someone would record what had happened. He then tried to ring to record the incident and couldn’t get a response so he wrote a note and said he would phone it in when he could and ring us in the next 24hrs to confirm he had done that. He also kept calling my dad ‘mate’ which I thought was inappropriate considering the circumstances. Nobody asked if we would like to make a complaint and I feel like my feelings about your unconcerned staff and their blasé attitude to a very nasty fall were completely dismissed. Working in retail myself  I am aware of the procedures my own colleagues would take if such an incident occurred in our shop  and I am confident they would never treat someone so nonchalantly under these circumstances. I felt that the staff were not only dismissive and uncaring but also rude. Your staff should not be cutting a customer off when they are trying to explain why they are upset and they should certainly have made some kind of effort to ensure my dad was ok following the shock he had suffered. Quite frankly  I expect a better level of service than this from Tesco and feel that  whilst in your store  your staff ought to have a duty of care for the customers which was severely lacking today.					2016-07-20T15:43:23+0000	1469029403	2016-07-20 17:43:23	3	7	9	0	16	7	5	2	4	0	3	0	0	0	1	4	0

Another customers  milk had seeped through onto my shopping. I also had broccoli delivered that was fit to throw into the bin  yellowing not fit to eat. This was returned with a few choice comments.......The majority of my fruit and veg were tainted with milk. I have had to unpackage most of the fresh stuff  wash  and repackage it. I have wiped jars and bottles down with spray and wipes.  Milk tainted shopping in this heat isn t acceptable. I ve thrown away some fruit. I spoke to customer services  and received a refund for £6.25  which doesn t cover the cost of the food tainted. And a five pound voucher for the inconvenience. Really  this is unacceptable  whilst I accept that accidents happen  now I have to go out shopping for fresh fruit and veg again 😒					2016-07-20T14:02:39+0000	1469023359	2016-07-20 16:02:39	0	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Carrots with only one day date on them. I checked and these items are supposed to have 2+ days on them. Fruit is Sour or has no taste whatsoever! We do our best to give our children here the best food  made from scratch  we possibly can. We can t afford to just go and replace the rubbish you send us. If we didn t need it for the following few days we wouldn t order it.

I have used this store daily over the years and have always been really satisfied with the service and products available. Due to work commitments I now don t get to this shop as often. Today my visit entailed standing in the middle of the shop trying to work.out where things might be  while the manager and other staff just walked by me  in my oast years there was always that friendly customer service where at these times you d hear  Are you OK there? Can I help?  BUT not today. Then.obbiously if you  like me  are on a diet but still would like a cake or desert of a low fat nature. YOU CAN T as tesco do one desert and no cakes! Such a shame when their larger store has the beat selection around. When I mentioned this to a member of staff she replied :the diet coke is in the Isle over there  and another said  we do fruit  obviously she hadn t seen  load of it in my trolly and fruit isn t the same as a cake is it? Also I wanted some small packets of sweets for a class I help out in l. Nope even though there is a school ten minutes walk away they don t stock anything like that the reply is  don t Wilkinson do them.  When I pointed out that as I run a small business myself I think it is appaulling that there is a market for these things as the children take them.in for their birthdays etc the persons face was blank.   I am so disappointed with what was a lovely small shop to have gone down hill over such a short time and not to stock things that are in demand in the area.   As I walked I out was spoken to by five people who said they have raised the same issues but it s a waste of time.  As a business woman it is hard enough to have customers come back to you time.and time again when they have to pay parking without not listening to them or worst still sending them elsewhere for things they want.   Tesco yiu have disappointed me and others by what I m being told.					2016-07-20T09:59:41+0000	1469008781	2016-07-20 11:59:41	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in to pay and the woman behind the till was very rude  she turned her back on me and was talking to her colleague and she knew I was there  when she serviced me she did not ask me which pump I was on or say how much it was and did not ask for club card so I handed my club card over and payment and nothing was said. The customer behind me was a pcso and the lady behind the till was good morning how r u and so nice. To top it off the lady behind the till was the petrol station manager but that does not mean she can be rude  she was very rude I will not be going there again and I always get my fuel from there  there lose					2016-07-20T09:33:34+0000	1469007214	2016-07-20 11:33:34	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The staff were excellent and sent someone to get a chair.I helped sit her down on the edge of the chiller and one of the staff got her a bucket as she felt sick. Once she was feeling better I left and went to finish my shopping. I was so surprised when a member of staff gave me a beautiful bunch of flowers for helping out. It was such a kind gesture that I almost burst into tears. Thank you staff of Tesco in Chard  you are great XXX					2016-07-20T09:27:52+0000	1469006872	2016-07-20 11:27:52	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now I can t buy them in any tesco store. It s hard enough being restricted with what you buy at sometimes 3x the  price  without you taking stuff off the shelves. Don t say it s to make room for new stuff because you haven t replaced it with anything. All I m left with is the nasty Boullieon granules that just taste of salt.					2016-07-20T06:57:41+0000	1468997861	2016-07-20 08:57:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst I have no issue with offer ends being changed during trade and understand the necessity of it I was highly embarrassed to listen to two members of staff spend at least 5 minutes loudly discussing their managers shortcomings and lack of organisational skills which prevented them from actually changing them. The conversation was very personal and highly inappropriate for the shop floor. I did not feel able to ask them what I needed as whilst I hovered to try and get their attention the conversation became more personal and made me feel very awkward. Then when I went to the self service tills I had to wait for a long time for assistance as two colleagues were engrossed in conversation the content and language choices again not suitable for the shop floor. The whole experience has led me to question the professionalism of your staff in the store.					2016-07-19T23:01:58+0000	1468969318	2016-07-20 01:01:58	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also the shop itself is absolutley boiling and has been for weeks now due to a problem with the fan/ air conditioning system. They have high powered fans in the shop that are just circulating the warm air.  Why has this not been fixed i asked the man on the till. He said   they were waiting for someone from head office to authorise the repair.   I find this very disappointing for such a large company to expect its staff to work in these conditions and also for customers to continue buying produce from such a poor looked after store.

And after placing it in the shed and take it back out to get compost then placing them back where they wanted it stored I felt a sharp scratch feeling quickly pulled my arm away to find a sharp twisted piece of metal on pulling it out of the bag I found it was 16cm in length. The bags were handled by several people and I would hate to think what injury would of been caused if someone had placed there hand in the bag or lent against it. I can take the metal object to the store on are next visit if it s required so you can investigate how this item came to be in the bag. I hope no more bags are likely to contain this item?.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13770480_10207365081990022_8073185822032430343_n.jpg?oh=7b4d20504503ca0dee3f658d8aaa7932&oe=58D70980	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13770480_10207365081990022_8073185822032430343_n.jpg?oh=b5eb662c0fed64d597380676f836bf1b&oe=58D8DC8D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207365081990022&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-19T20:36:29+0000	1468960589	2016-07-19 22:36:29	0	5	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

The handlebars won t go in as the bits are different sizes. Can you advise what to do please as I bought it from Tesco Direct and can t get through on customer services.

Rang Tesco online customer services - they couldn t offer a replacement as they had gone back up to £29-99 and  I only paid £11-00 including delivery.  Full refund including delivery and keep it - you might be able to mend it!					2016-07-19T20:31:41+0000	1468960301	2016-07-19 22:31:41	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firelighters  kindling you name it... it was like trying to light ice. So anyhoo  with the nice weather back home  we thought we d try again and put the last incident down to a bad batch.... but no..... Another bbq  bought in another country did exactly the same.

He introduced himself as he is a new driver to us.  He was polite and friendly and took the time out to have a conversation with my three year old about his picnic for the seaside.

I ve never exchanged points for Alton towers plus cash one. Have codes but it s talking about peak and off peak and that you have to select which one you want. We re going September so am assuming off peak but dates for off peak ended 1st July. Are we off peak? Do you select your date and it tells you?

I don t like artificial sweeteners  a- the taste lingers  yerghhhhhh  and b- I don t quite know what effect they will have on my body  but I know exactly what sugar does  and shop accordingly. So  if I have to buy lemonade  I avoid the ones declaring   sugar free  . Recently I bought this lemonade. Both aspartame and saccharine are chemically produced sweeteners  and as such qualify as flavourings.     Teeny fibs yet again...........

After spending the best part of 2 hours yesterday morning shopping with my 1 year old  which isn t that easy  I arrived at the scan and shop tills  I had my shopping random checked and had all the tags removed from certain items to fine in horror that i had left my wallet at home. I explained the situation to the lady on the scan and shop tills and she was very understanding and took me to customer services. Again I explained that I had left my wallet at home and asked if I could get my wife to pay by card over the phone  only to be told that Tesco s CAN T accept over the phone payments. How in a digital age where people can order from the same store online and pay over the internet  can they not process a payment over the phone!

I tried to purchase 2 bottles of Pimms but because my 17 year old son took them from the basket onto the checkout   he was then asked for ID  even though it was my purchase and I was paying  he was just helping. he obviously didn t have any ID  but wasn t trying to buy anything.  she then refused to sell it to me  I had to then go back and collect more  which I carried  and paid for. Could you please clarify what would happen if I was unable to carry such things and needed help would this still have happened.  The assistant was very rude and wouldn t listen to any explanation.					2016-07-19T14:38:50+0000	1468939130	2016-07-19 16:38:50	4	8	4	0	12	8	2	6	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

What I don t appreciate is your decision to conduct the construction/maintenance work on your store  which involved the use of power drills (which are very loud  might I add)  at 1am on a Monday night and 6am the next morning.   The contractors were very apologetic when we complained and advised they were doing it at this time to avoided store closure. Yes  doing work at this time allows you to keep your store open with little impact to your operations. However this shows complete disregard for your locals and lack of care for the customer who were kept awake.  Spare a thought for the locals who pop in for a pint of milk on a regular basis. Think about the customer who might now pop into Sainsburys for coffee after a restless nights sleep rather than their local Tesco...

I ve wasted 2 family day holidays sitting in the house  can t even go in the garden as I can t hear the door in the garden and seeing as though the delivery company didn t ring me on Monday I very much doubt they would ring me today to say they are outside. I ve rang direct customer services twice who try to ring company but can t get through. Nobody rang me to say it was going to be late   It is still on system that its coming yesterday and is in progress. Someone rang me at 10 yo ask if id got it  i said i hadnt but no further calls.   I get my shopping delivered at least once a week and presumed it would be as reliable.  I regularly order from direct with delivery instore but unfortunately this wasn t an option.   I m very annoyed could someone didn t ring this morning and since I rang at 9am no one has contacted me with a new delivery time.					2016-07-19T10:55:12+0000	1468925712	2016-07-19 12:55:12	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It arrived with this label on it.  Why on earth would someone send a DVD marked  does not play  to a customer?  Surely it should have been checked and if it worked (which it doesn t!) the label removed and if not the DVD should be removed from your stock.  I know it was a good price but I didn t realise I was essentially playing a lottery to see if I got a DVD that actually worked or not!  Please advise how we can get this resolved?

There always seems to be an issue with the self checkouts there and today was no exception. There were no staff members in sight so he had to shout for assistance! He was waiting for over two minutes for someone to come to assist and did not get an apology for his wait. Surely there should always be a staff member on hand. Customers should not have to shout for help!					2016-07-19T07:45:07+0000	1468914307	2016-07-19 09:45:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a pushchair and even if I didn t I m sure it s a health and safety risk for anybody to walk round it. With only 4 Isles to use 2 yesterday were blocked by delivery trolleys. This is the case 90% of the time I go in there. And I have to go in there being the local shop to the school. I couldn t even get down to get some bread yesterday unless I left the pushchair the other end of the Isle.  There is also a massive wall support smack bang in the middle of the back section which can only just fit the pushchair one way not the other as the Isle is to close to it. It s definitely not a child friendly shop. Ps it also has no que system so anyone and everyone ques anywhere up all the Isles making it even harder to get around.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13710037_10154522769075967_5824086014324697058_n.jpg?oh=5a30fc538727dbcf65aae4e8d28e78a9&oe=58DD3E75	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13710037_10154522769075967_5824086014324697058_n.jpg?oh=029262ae36c7055ba4757dc307aaf84e&oe=591D4078	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154522769075967&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-19T06:14:12+0000	1468908852	2016-07-19 08:14:12	6	7	7	0	14	7	2	5	1	0	6	1	0	0	0	0	0

Few years ago I had complained on this page about the service and had stopped using Tesco. Started online service again last year and I must say that you have great service once again matched with the maximum product availability. Customer Service is fantastic as well. Bought some items a few months ago through Tesco direct. Was not particularly happy with the items but the customer service handled my complaint professionally and to my satisfaction. Thanks a lot!

To cut a long story short  we had ordered a Plum trampoline and when it arrived it was missing the bouncy bit which makes it tricky to bounce!   A replacement was supplied but it was missing the bouncy part again!!   Apparently we weren t the only ones to have had this problem with Plum trampolines. By now Tesco had realised the problem and had removed the product from the warehouse which meant we couldn t get an exact replacement.   Our son is on the autistic spectrum and struggles with disappointment more than your average child. Stephen took this case on and did everything he could to help. He emailed Plum to try and resolve the issue  and when they couldn t he suggested alternatives. He phoned me when he said he would  and kept me informed.   He has been helpful and friendly throughout and I thought it was important to let you know that I thought his customer care was excellent.					2016-07-18T18:45:53+0000	1468867553	2016-07-18 20:45:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The food you eat becomes a very important part of your day. Just had the TESCO  healthy living  Pulled Ham in Mustard Sauce. There was a very small portion of Ham unlike the photograph on the packaging. The mustard sauce was completely bland  and flavourless. The beans were tough  and chewy  the carrots soggy  and the mash completely dry. Thank you Tesco for this uplifting culinary experience.					2016-07-18T17:34:15+0000	1468863255	2016-07-18 19:34:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So chatty and friendly.   It always makes me happy because I know that for some people - the elderly  for example - they might not have other company etc. and when they are able to encounter someone who goes the extra mile I think it s capable of making a difference to their quality of life; the same is true for cashiers in physical shops.  So anyway  I hope that there is a way to get this feedback across. The order was processed in Romford  and the van was  2V/1388   delivered today. If you need more information to give this man recognition please let me know :)					2016-07-18T16:43:40+0000	1468860220	2016-07-18 18:43:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Is this correct? If so I think that is appaling and I m very upset as I only went to tesco for this tent and only because it was in the sale and only had a short amount of time to spare so could not go elsewhere in time to get a cheaper sun shade for my son. Hope you can help me with this.

As a result of this i now want to know what you are going to do next?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13699945_10201844043739237_4220674228400061197_n.jpg?oh=2503d9efa29e2db4c7c657d245c94c25&oe=58EAC040	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13699945_10201844043739237_4220674228400061197_n.jpg?oh=d7f786a7ed77aa649056c289af8e4fdc&oe=58E3CD34	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201844043739237&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-18T13:45:28+0000	1468849528	2016-07-18 15:45:28	109	165	132	101	398	162	92	70	279	0	108	0	14	8	0	1	0

You ve got gluten free food with torn packaging  still on display with rogue food items near it so it s more than  likely not gluten free anymore  which could cause a coeliac like my sister to be extremely ill if the torn packaging was not noticed.

I just went to Tesco express in Golders Green and was completely shocked when I opened my Quinoa & Black Rice Salad. Mould covering the surface  see photo attached.  Health hazard is an understatement  if I hadn t have been wearing my glasses this could have been far more serious. Needless to say the expiry date was the 18th July (TODAY).

I haven t bought fish from this store for a while now  the last time was gone off haddock! Today I thought I d give it another go and bought some cockles. They were bought frozen and I ve defrosted them  rinsed them and they tasted of ammonia. It s disgusting to think that you spend money on food which you expect to be fresh to end up with this. Thanks for the horrible taste I now have in my mouth from popping a couple in my mouth!					2016-07-18T13:02:54+0000	1468846974	2016-07-18 15:02:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just inflated it and filled it up for my son to discover that there is a hole in it 😭  We were so looking forward to our  couple of days  of summer splashing in the new  big  pool. Is there anything you can do? Thank you x					2016-07-18T12:59:02+0000	1468846742	2016-07-18 14:59:02	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I live in Cyprus and I understand that you re not shipping clothes to Cyprus anymore.   OK  I can accept that.  However can you tell me why  in this day and age when there is so much technology available  I can t place an order from a Cyprus address and pay with my UK credit card (which recognises my Cyprus address)  and have my clothes order sent to a UK address where some kind soul is willing to post them for me?   Other major suppliers seem to have system which can accommodate the billing address being different from the delivery address.   Amazon have been doing this for around 15 years.

I was disgusted to find blood on the toilet seat toilet paper on the floor and although soap was provided it was of poor quality and the water was stone cold. I understand that public toilets can get abit messy but what made it worse was there was a cleaning lady just outside the toilets who made no effort to check the toilets and just walked off. Come on Tesco get in there with some bleach and antibac soap.					2016-07-18T10:22:01+0000	1468837321	2016-07-18 12:22:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m regularly ending up doing my shopping with Morrisons where there are consistently weekday slots for £1 or £2  sometimes 50p or free!  With losing the double up on clubcard points and the inflated delivery prices I don t think I will be a regular Tesco shopper any more.					2016-07-18T09:41:06+0000	1468834866	2016-07-18 11:41:06	1	7	2	0	9	7	5	2	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

After insisting that she had made a mistake and I used a different self service after the card reader had failed  to no prevail. I was maid to look through a bin of receipts.  So I had to ask for the system to only find out.. had paid for my items. Will be avoiding the store from now on after the embarrassment and accusations made against me.

My warning light was not on (about another 10 miles or so) and my car dies an average of 39 miles after the warning light (according to some research from a reputable website). I paid at 111.9p a litre and the price total was more than I had ever paid even when fuel was at its height in the one thirties. Surely the range I had left was more than 1.21 litres and the pump never even cut off. I stopped it myself as I thought it was never going to stop!!! Have I been conned??? 😡😢					2016-07-17T23:43:54+0000	1468799034	2016-07-18 01:43:54	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Husband is just bk from tesco  express in furze platt Maidenhead. He purchased a vype e pen that we found to be broken when we opened it. He went straight back with the receipt for an exchange not a refund but an exchange and was rudely looked up and down by your member of staff called Arif and was refused an exchange. I m sure trading standards states that if an item is faulty and bought back with a receipt within 28 days then by law the customer should be offered an exchange or store credit to that value?? The fact that all this all happened in the last hour I m sure my husband was well within his rights to the exchange he asked for. Unfortunately it being Sunday the customer service line has closed which is why I have turned to you here. I don t see why we should have to wait till tomorrow to be heard by your gigantic company.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q86/s130x130/13697208_10201771760011096_3991632123928176832_n.jpg?oh=b2d7c14b7f687777316e9f5e1ac4e96f&oe=58DD09DC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q86/s720x720/13697208_10201771760011096_3991632123928176832_n.jpg?oh=91c8ebe6aa1a36fcc4019334be7231f5&oe=591EB630	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201771760011096&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-17T20:17:41+0000	1468786661	2016-07-17 22:17:41	3	20	4	0	24	20	3	17	5	0	3	0	0	0	1	0	0

Seeing the page has inspired me to comment here in the hope  management  is properly aware of how truly special their staff is. I am a frequent customer and can testify that every time I visit the store I am assured of a warm  friendly and courteous welcome. Today was no different  and when I failed to locate an item I was looking for  I sought help from the nearest available assistant  who today just happened to be Kaie. She was busy stocking shelves at the time  but cheerfully led me through the aisles to the right spot. She invariably has a smile and a friendly word for customers  as do the rest of her colleagues. How lucky we are to have a store staffed with such kind people like Katie. They make shopping into something to look forward to and I d like to say  thank you  to each and every one of them. Management  take note. i hope you appreciate them too.					2016-07-17T19:51:40+0000	1468785100	2016-07-17 21:51:40	6	4	6	0	10	4	3	1	6	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

The first thing I did when I arrived was head to baby change with my 6 month old daughter. As I walked past the cigarette kiosk the lady working on there saw my nappy etc and called over to me and advised that if I needed anything else to give her a call she had nappies wipes and anything else I needed. Her exact words were  if you get stuck just give me a shout  That was a great welcome into the store!   My next stop was the Electrical Desk where I was served by one of the friendliest Retail workers I ve ever had the pleasure to meet! He was warm   friendly and totally genuine and I ll be honest he made me definitely think about choosing Tesco for other electrical purchases as his service was OUTSTANDING! I bought a few more items and went through self service where the attendant was also lovely! I m not sure if I stepped into an alternate universe today in Tesco or if the store is always that good but either way I m a very happy customer and want the staff to know they are appreciated 😀😀😀					2016-07-17T19:26:30+0000	1468783590	2016-07-17 21:26:30	19	5	20	0	25	5	3	2	0	0	18	1	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to make you aware of the cooking instructions on the back of your Kale bags. We like to steam ours in the microwave and followed the instructions on the bag. It doesn t say anything about adding any water so we put it in as is and 1 minute later the kale and the pot caught fire. We were lucky to have spotted it and hope this does happen to anyone else. I would recommend some reinvestigation on the wording and test it without water as the instructions state.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13769396_10153628158217056_1361787455558231105_n.jpg?oh=fc919377c0ef13eb802773752d304f16&oe=5923C63D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13769396_10153628158217056_1361787455558231105_n.jpg?oh=27d2322a262960bd49183affc9ce1261&oe=58DC9830	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153628158217056&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-17T19:04:11+0000	1468782251	2016-07-17 21:04:11	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I think his name is marios? He followed me around the clothing section whilst I was there and he made this very clear  for one if I was going to steal I think I would have taken at least a bag or a coat! I was in my work uniform and had a little purse with me! When I went to purchase my goods I spoke to a member of staff and told them he said he would have a word as he knows I m a regular customer and it s not nice so I thanked him and left. Last night I visited again and your security guard is following a mother who had several young kids running about like kids do he followed her to self service and the kids being kids made scanning her shopping that bit more difficult what probably didn t help the fact is that your guard followed her there and stood on the outside of the self serve one till down I say stood in fact he was bent over the rails! Your cctv would probably prove this! He really makes me feel like uncomfortable and as a regular shopper in your store I don t wish to be made to feel that way I d rather go elsewhere! If he makes me feel like that God knows what he made that mother feel and I imagine he does it to many other people!					2016-07-17T18:45:29+0000	1468781129	2016-07-17 20:45:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just sat down to my meal and the steaks are extremely tough. Not what I would have expected from your finest range. They were not overdone because I like them to be red in the middle. They have a lot of fatty bits in them and it s near impossible to cut  let alone chew. If I had known that Tescos  finest  steaks were this bad I would have bought one decent steak for more money... I have previously bought steaks from Aldi  and while I didn t expect much  they were lovely. So I will be going to them for steak in future. I wanted to let you know my disappointment.

Your manager James was very rude. Counting a lot of cash behind the till. Talking rudely to me and staff. I made him aware of drinks leaking all over the floor and no one went and cleaned it up.

However  the nine year implementation renders it meaningless.  So many more people are really thinking about the effects on other species regarding what they consume  nowadays that your nine-year implementation is already behind the times.  Vegetanarianism won t happen overnight but people are already looking for ethical ways of buying what meat they do eat and eggs are an important part of most people s diets.   The public are also becoming very educated about how eggs are produced and how the hens are treated and many of us are aware that even so-called  free range  are anything but.  We know those images of fields and hay bales are fiction  especially those of us that end up mopping up the mess at the end of this egg production by rescuing and nursing back to health the poor creatures from most of the factory farms.  I already don t buy store-bought eggs as I like to know I am not causing harm to the animal producing them but I am afraid I may have to desist from shopping at Tesco until a way may be found to discontinue the cage-produced eggs.  Other stores are leading the way in looking at more ethical - and healthy- produce and I do suggest that Tesco follow their lead sooner rather than later if it wishes to keep it s market-share.

We have a weekly delivery from Tesco and the drivers are always lovely. Especially the young chap i had back in March; With shopping due 9-10am hubby took kids on school run and driver was promptly here at 9.05am. I unlocked the back (our drivers always use the backdoor for ease) but i was struggling as i had only been home for a day or two  from a long stay in hospital. As we were chatting the driver asked if i was okay as he had only seen my hubby for the previous few weeks. I proceeded to explain my recent misfortune and he stopped me right there  ordered me to take a seat and unpacked all my 9/10 crates of food. He told me off -in jest - for not telling him sooner and made sure i was okay before he left.  I did call customer services to bring it to their attention as in all honesty i wouldn t hesitate to complain if i had a problem  making it only fair to give them praise when i have had a great experience receiving my shopping.  That small selfless act made my day and i will never forget his kindness.   Well done Tesco!! 😊😊😊					2016-07-17T17:45:40+0000	1468777540	2016-07-17 19:45:40	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought one of your finest meal deals tonight at your Blairgowrie store for tomorrow night. Just got home and the trifle goes out of date tonight!!! It was on the shelf with the normal goods. I have only just spotted the reduction sticker on it  of course as its part of a meal deal I haven t benefited from any reduction as I still had to pay £10 for the deal even though the trifle is absolutely no use to me. Why on earth wasn t it in the reduced section  that s right  it wasn t there because you know people will pick it up and not notice. Very disappointed that this has happened again.					2016-07-17T15:54:25+0000	1468770865	2016-07-17 17:54:25	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The driver was lovely and very sympathetic towards my situation.  Now it s Sunday and there was a knock on my door and there stood the same tesco delivery man with two tubs of paint for my kitchen.  I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to Tesco and my lovely delivery man for this wonderful suprise.  The kindness of the gesture brought me to tears .  Thank you so much   I really appreciate it and will get to work on sorting my kitchen with the paint provided .					2016-07-17T15:38:08+0000	1468769888	2016-07-17 17:38:08	25	1	25	0	26	1	1	0	2	0	24	0	0	0	0	0	0

Will now be steering clear of Tesco and advising everyone I know of the horrific bad service my brother experienced.  After his baby being born not breathing on Friday and his partner and baby now being monitored in hospital he is absolutely exhausted spending every minute either at the hospital with his new born daughter and partner or at home building cots and getting the house ready as his daughter was born premature.  Last night as baby and mum are due to come home today he went to Tesco after a long day at the hospital and spending all night rearranging and building furniture in the house at about 11pm at the Bedworth store! My brother filled his trolley with over £100 worth of shopping including cot sheets  non chemical baby wipes  nappies  food and other necessary items. He was there with my other brother and the two of them were rushing around when the 15 minute announcement went off to make sure they had got everything they needed for the arrival of the new baby coming home. He had pre scanned all his items in the hope it would make it quicker for the staff as he knew he didn t have much time. NO other announcement was made at the store closing so you can imagine his surprise when he got to the till to pay at 12.04. He was shouted over by a rude security lady who was sat watching the cameras (how malicious that she watched my brother running around tesco knowing they were closed and wouldn t let him buy his shopping  wow) the security guard said they couldn t buy the shopping as they had shut (4 minutes ago)  my brother explained his situation and as the security guard was rude and smug my brother asked for the manager. Well Tesco I think you should invest in some new managers.  My brother explained his situation and begged and pleaded he said he could pay in cash or on card of either was easier  the manager refused and laughed with the security guard at my brother (obviously getting some kind of sick enjoyment at a desperate and exhausted father) my brother has been through the most traumatic weekend of his life and was visibly upset and exhausted yet your staff were so rude and obnoxious and couldn t even do a humane gesture of goodwill. There was one announcement that you were closing and no others  my brothers we locked in the Tesco even though the security guard was watching the cameras. I understand you close at a certain time but 4 minutes with a trolley full of shopping visibly with baby things in there. After 20 minutes both my brothers left empty handed even though in that 20 minutes they could have purchased the shopping as it was pre scanned and even if it wasn t wouldn t have taken more than 20 minutes to scan through. Good to know after my brothers baby was born not breathing and him and his partner have had the most difficult and exhausting weekend Tesco couldn t have a little compassion for a desperate and exhausted father who was 4 minutes late to the till.  I would like to point out all the tills were still open.  Is this the reputation you pride yourselves on?!  My brother shops weekly at Tesco in Bedworth but after this won t be going back there to be treated awfully again. Appalling.					2016-07-17T11:04:58+0000	1468753498	2016-07-17 13:04:58	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have been doing our weekly shop here for a few years now  but in recent months we feel the store has gone down hill.   Firstly  the best before dates on fruit and veg are often the same day or the next day and those with better dates seem to be of poorer quality versus this time last year. It also seems ironic that in spite of the shelf edge labelling claiming  best of British  we struggled to find anything that wasn t from Chile  New Zealand or South Africa. Buying British produce is very important to us.   Secondly  the levels of cleanliness are quite shocking. All around the store seems to be littered with discarded packaging and receipts and the floors in general need a good wash!  Finally  although the colleague at the customer services desk was very polite and friendly  the shop floor staff seem to be in need of some training! Many of the aisles were blocked with abandoned stock cages and trolleys from staff completing online shopping tasks. In addition to abandoned trolleys  one member of staff was charging around the refrigerator section almost bumping into me with no acknowledgment or apology for nearly causing a collision!  Unfortunately  we are seriously considering whether or not to continue shopping with Tesco. I hope these comments are taken into consideration  we just want the Tesco from last year back!					2016-07-17T11:02:59+0000	1468753379	2016-07-17 13:02:59	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Don t advertise fitting room opening times if there s no staff member working on them. Twice I had to ask customer service to call for someone to let me try clothes on and twice I was left waiting each time. No apology either after each time I went up to say I was still waiting. At the till then all I was told was  yeh the girls phoned in sick and we can t find the keys . Bit of a ridiculous excuse to say to a customer! That s good management for you  losing store keys.

Pardon me for being cynical but saying it s all down to a 12 year old girl is a lovely  How caring are we   story but it s more likely that sales of them have dropped.

How sad though that this wonderfully ethical decision will take 9 years to implement. Today my friend rescued 3 cages hens which are in the most horrendous condition imaginable. As a result  I ve taken the difficult decision to refrain from shopping in Tesco until the misery of these beautiful animals is no more part of your retail policy. I should mention of course that Tesco is my nearest store.  Kind regards Anne					2016-07-16T21:25:12+0000	1468704312	2016-07-16 23:25:12	18	11	21	4	36	11	7	4	13	0	18	0	0	0	0	3	0

Are you not allowed to have stock of diesel until you sort out cashflow issues or is the person who orders stock for fuel at this store just a numpty? Not the first time this has happened at this particular store neither.					2016-07-16T20:59:18+0000	1468702758	2016-07-16 22:59:18	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I went back to my local tesco in market rasen I told a young lad that worked on the department what happen  he basically said that they have had numerous complaints about it and explained it was a delivery fault?!? Anyway these things happen so I certainly wasn t going to make a fuss about it. I then picked up two more 4 pint bottles of your whole milk. Again I ve been feeding it to my son and today I realised it was well and truly off!!! Even though it s dated until 22 July. I then poured the contents down the sink and opened the other 4 pint bottle and straight away it bloody well sinks!!!! I m really not happy! This is 3 I ve bought and poured straight down the sink not to mention what could have happened/ still could happen to my son. I m totally disgusted. It s one thing making a mistake but the tesco employee admitted there was a fault with the product so the company was clearly aware 2 weeks ago to my knowledge. It needs removing from the shelves before someone else s child becomes seriously ill!!!!!

Call customer services when it still hasn t arrived and it takes 15 minutes for them to find out YOU have cancelled my order because YOU can t deliver it and not even notified me. You should be grateful for the professional Raj who took my call  it s only thanks to him that I m considering giving you another chance. I hear Occado are price matching now and Sainsbury are offering me £50 off my first order to give them a try.

As a fan of steak I am very disappointed not to have 2 good sized pieces of steak like I ordered. I can t imagine whoever cut this steak would want it for themselves for a steak dinner so why give it to a customer and expect them to be happy?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13770418_10154372383583675_358482701356425684_n.jpg?oh=0035b13ff8ab47e605dd2377393585c6&oe=58E20B09	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13770418_10154372383583675_358482701356425684_n.jpg?oh=3fc5469f721dfdd63fdcef53f1eb930f&oe=58E20F1C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154372383583675&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-16T18:24:35+0000	1468693475	2016-07-16 20:24:35	0	13	2	0	15	12	4	8	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

But when I call customer services an utterly unhelpful employee tells me that the driver is already back at base loading up his lorry with more deliveries and by no means will he be told to instantly return to finish my delivery. When I then speak to the manager and enquire where this tesco base is  it becomes crystal clear that someone at tesco is lying as the base is approximately 20 minutes from my house AND the driver made a further delivery after mine. It is logistically impossible for your driver to make it back to base in the time that I called! Clearly someone is lying at tesco!. I look forward to the result of your internal investigation. A helpful suggestion would be for someone to put their hand up in the air and say that they re sorry for lying! ....sadly  I fully believe that nobody will be brave enough to do so. Cheers tesco customer services!					2016-07-16T18:16:09+0000	1468692969	2016-07-16 20:16:09	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My family (myself  my husband  my 7 year old and my 16 year old son) were shopping in the store this afternoon. Whilst I went to check the price of some lego that had been wrongly labelled  unbeknown to me  my husband was belittled and humiliated by a member of staff. He was accused of purchasing 2 bottles of Craft Ale for my 16 year old son. The woman in question had made an assumption  based on no facts or evidence that the beers were not for my husband (they were) but that he had been coerced by my own son into buying them. She them proceeded to announce across from her till ( the assistant on our till was underage) for all and sundry to hear that she shouldn`t really be letting him have the beer but she would do so on this occasion. As if she was doing him a favour.  I would like some feedback on this please and thank you.					2016-07-16T17:58:50+0000	1468691930	2016-07-16 19:58:50	0	17	0	0	17	17	4	13	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just been in your store at Kingston park where myself and my family have witnessed your security staff being completely over the top with regards to customers who have just paid for their goods. They are watching people at the checkouts  who they can clearly see are paying and then immediately stopping them and asking to see their receipts before checking their shopping trolleys. According to your checkout staff this has been going on all day  much to their embarrassment. I ve never felt so uncomfortable whilst paying for my groceries. A woman on the aisle next to me paid for her goods and was watched doing this by a security guard and was stopped 6ft away from the checkout. It was completely out of order. Are the security staff somehow saying that your checkout staff are untrustworthy??? I felt compelled to approach the woman who looked clearly embarrassed and ask her to put a complaint in to the manager. It was then a member of your lovely checkout staff went over to ask this guy what the hell he was playing at. I m all for people taking their work seriously but come on  this is beyond a joke.  Now I thought this was the end of it until walking out we saw a young couple who were flanked by 3 security guards who accused them of having something under their coat and the man then had to shake his coat in front of them  and customers. It turns out they had nothing at all on them and they had been right to plead their innocence. It s a left a sour taste in my mouth how people can be treated in such a manner. We re frankly disgusted. We hope you address this matter. I m not expecting you to go in and start sacking people....but every little helps 😉					2016-07-16T16:48:31+0000	1468687711	2016-07-16 18:48:31	8	2	11	1	14	2	2	0	2	0	8	0	0	3	0	0	0

Undeterred I phoned tesco and after half an hour on the phone  I believed I had re-ordered my original order to be re-delivered today  I even paid again and had my payment authenticated. But no  once again my order has not turned up  so I phone yet again and get told there is nothing that can be done  no offer to sort it out  no offer to reorder for tomorrow  no  just some guy telling me there is nothing he can do. To make matters worse  I have just seen a tesco van go passed my house  which as I live in out in the wilds and get about 4 vehicles a day go passed  seems like rubbing salt in the wound. So no food for us this weekend  but what do tesco care  after all I ve only had 200 oh no sorry 199 orders delivered previously  obviously I m not that important to them.					2016-07-16T15:47:27+0000	1468684047	2016-07-16 17:47:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As you can imagine I was very shocked and upset to be treated this way as I am a very regular customer and definitely not a thief  ! I made a complaint via telephone after and  Spoke to a manager called scott  who was lovely and apologised for how Id been treated   today I visited again (big mistake) I felt very awkward from the beginning but when my grandaughter and I go to the self checkout .. We paid for her two little pocket money toys ( she paid with the money for her own purse and Popped it into her bag) and lo and behold the same guy comes over and asks us if we had paid for our items ????? Ive made another complaint with management (Dan) at the store but he didnt seem at all concerned at the way Id been treated at the store it seems protecting their stock is of paramount importance as that s the only justification he could offer me !!He explained that there is a big shoplifting problem there but that shouldn t affect my visit it s not my problem as a customer !! Im so upset and angry again !! What the hell is going on with that store !!? Im just so shocked !! Really really shocked ... Way to go !!					2016-07-16T15:24:57+0000	1468682697	2016-07-16 17:24:57	0	19	0	0	19	19	14	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not an insignificant amount  so it was definitely a considered purchase. Unfortunately this morning the small button that operates the Fit Bit fell out. So I called at the store with the receipt and box. The response was  I was put on the phone to speak to someone at Tesco support who simply said sorry  you are out of the 30 day period  here is a telephone number for the manufacturer   they are open  between 9-5 Monday to Friday  thanks for your call goodbye. The member of staff at the store while pleasant enough simply said we ve just changed our policy to stop people taking advantage!  Now I understand the need for a process etc  and yes I am over the 30 days but what really disappointed me was the lack of any customer care. It really smacked of we ve had your money so you are on your own! So out of interest I contacted Argos to see what they would do.It seems that had I bought my item from them I could have  returned the faulty item to the store (despite the fact that I bought the item 35 days ago!) and they would either have exchanged it there and then or dealt with sending it back to arrange a repair. That to me is what you call a good after care service which gives you confidence in the retailer. When I bought this item from Tesco I very nearly called at the Argos store  that is across the way from the Tesco store  Oh how I wished I had. I definitely won t be making that mistake again. Where is your customer care Tesco... ?					2016-07-16T15:08:05+0000	1468681685	2016-07-16 17:08:05	2	6	2	0	8	6	2	4	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My scales at home weigh the cherries at 630g so I believe that I have been overcharged by .628 x £2.50 or £1.57. Here are the photos showing this.

The theological basis would appear to be Revelation 3:16   But because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot  I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth.  This description applies (in my draconian world view) to the people who provide the market for the coffee pod on the right (see below). The Barista version on the left is a pleasantly bitter espresso  with a good thick mouth feel. I like it. It s a bit of a beast. In contrast  the one on the right is a milder espresso. Their-in lies my problem. Espresso is not  nor should it be  a moderate beverage. It is for people who want their coffee as strong  bitter  and tasty as it can possibly be. So why would anyone want an espresso that s  not too strong ?! Each to their own and so on  but (like the red squirrel supplanted by an aggressive invader) the Barista version is being forced out by the blander version. Which means I have to drink the red one this week. Other brands of coffee pod are available.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q81/s130x130/13718789_1613372012306844_706007051900984969_n.jpg?oh=e5bf1e3daf71059e7ff3d34b4b221543&oe=58E1BED4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q83/s720x720/13718789_1613372012306844_706007051900984969_n.jpg?oh=9dc67e59edca6aa15289f474546181d4&oe=591DCA40	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1613372012306844&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-16T13:17:14+0000	1468675034	2016-07-16 15:17:14	2	8	2	0	10	6	3	3	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

After being a bit miffed that I had to travel further to buy my favourite wine  I was very pleased to be paying less than the other supermarket originally!  At the till I asked if they sold playing cards  not knowing if they did the girl sent me in the close direction but I had no luck. I saw a staff member who was polite enough to look with me but we discovered they were out of stock. Paying for my items at the self service  he came back up to me and said he spoke to a colleague that was looking upstairs for me (even though I had previously said not to worry)  he scurried off and in 2 minutes both men were back with playing cards...reduced to 8p! I couldn t believe it! He then said that I could just have them (I hope he doesn t get into trouble for this!!) After he assured me it was okay  I walked away extremely happy with wonderful service! Sadly  I didn t catch their names but my thanks to them who helped me enjoy my wine with a few games of snap!					2016-07-16T12:41:19+0000	1468672879	2016-07-16 14:41:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Been a loyal customer of Tesco Burgess Hill since it opened many years ago. Today I needed their help. So my husband calls them for me...We have an 11 week old baby and it s a blisteringly hot day. Tomorrow is his special christening day. My mum and I are catering for a party of 50 or more. The very last thing I need is 4 large freshly baked baguettes. My husband asks nicely if these baguettes can be baked ready for us to collect this evening in the hope that they won t be stale by morning. The answer we are given is a straight NO!!!!! A complete refusal to help in any way 😦😔 So we ask to be put through to a supervisor in the hope that we may appeal to their better nature....After all I must have spent thousands with Tesco over the years. After being kept on hold for a ridiculous amount of time no one answered so we had to give up. Clearly your moto of  every little helps  doesn t apply to customers of your main Tesco branch. Poor show!!! 😠					2016-07-16T12:11:32+0000	1468671092	2016-07-16 14:11:32	2	16	2	0	18	16	11	5	12	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This-morning  I popped in to the Ballymena (County Antrim) store  and seeing as I had my toddler and 2 newborns with me  I proceeded to park at the Parent and child section of the carpark. Luckily  I was able to get a space in Parent and Child. My previous 2 visits I was not so lucky  which is stressful when you have young children to get out and in of your car!  My issue is  that although I was able to get an available space in this section of the carpark today  I noticed that a member of staff was parked in the first Parent and Child Space  just outside the front doors of the store.  The woman in question was wearing her Tesco uniform  and was packing her own shopping into her car. She did not have any children with her whatsoever  so shouldn t have been using a Parent and Child parking space. I took photographs of her number plate and of her getting into her car  which I will send privately  so you can identify this member of staff.  It really gets my back up when ordinary members of the public use these spaces when they don t need them  so I m sure you can understand how annoyed I am to see a member of Tescos own staff doing it! It seems that your staff use these spaces themselves  because they are so close to the door and they are obviously too lazy to park elsewhere.  Unfortunately  it s a regular occurrence at this store.  I think Tesco need to remind the staff at this store  that Parent and Child spaces are for the use of parents with children with them! 😠					2016-07-16T12:07:52+0000	1468670872	2016-07-16 14:07:52	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

However it did not last long. Quorn Vegan burgers have been out of stock for at least a month  yet no out of stock sticker has been used and the cholocate icecream sticks have been out of stock for about a month also. Crooksfoot Tesco doesn t even sell the Vegan quorn burgers or the Cashew milk and their chocolate icecream sticks have also been out of stock for about a month. It is very frustrating that the stores don t sell the same stuff for the same customers and equally that they can t get enough stock in. It has forced me to shop at Sainsburys/Ocado for a lot of products once again.					2016-07-16T11:55:43+0000	1468670143	2016-07-16 13:55:43	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You need to pay the £3 delivery service for each item you buy.  They do not tell you this.  You spend the time ordering each item and add it to the basket but they remove each item from your basket when you add something new.  This way when you pay you think you ve ordered all your items and paid one delivery charge but in fact you have only paid for the last item you added to your basket so you are forced to go back and order again and of course pay the £3 charge again.  Very low Tesco  very low.					2016-07-16T11:51:38+0000	1468669898	2016-07-16 13:51:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You always offered good delivery prices from £1 - £3 . Now most of the delivery slots are £5  £6 or £7 !!!! How can you justify such a price hike when the likes of Iceland can offer FREE DELIVERY for orders over £35. Get it together Tesco or myself and lots of other people will just go elsewhere .					2016-07-16T10:20:50+0000	1468664450	2016-07-16 12:20:50	4	3	4	0	7	3	3	0	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

At my checkout I had some frozen cocktails in with my shopping  ready to take them home ready for tomorrow. Upon going to pay at the self service my shopping wouldn t go through  only for an assistant to come and tell me alcohol wasn t served after 11pm  a gentleman at the side of me had the same experience.  Is this something new in all stores? As I haven t experienced it before and didn t see any signs up/ forms of writing detailing this?

Really Tesco is that your policy?? I worked for Superquinn for 6 years and we d close the incoming doors at closing but shoppers got to finish their shop  tills closed when the last person left. Imagine making someone cry cause your staff were in a rush to get home. Shame on you Tesco.					2016-07-15T22:10:15+0000	1468620615	2016-07-16 00:10:15	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just opened it and it smelt so bad and the chicken had gone grey!!  How is this ok considering it is still in date ???

Inside I found the Trolley Dash section  buy 4 items and prepare a meal in 20 mins  right up my street as a single busy man who can t really cook. So of shopping with magazine in basket to collect all items needed. Ham hock salad with grains  able to get 3 of the 4 items listed  asparagus and broccoli in same pack not on the shelves. You can buy them in seperate packs at double the cost. Whilst I was looking for the French dressing I was approached by a tesco assistant and asked if I needed help  usually I just grumble I m ok and get on with it  On this occasion I pointed out the recipe in the magazine and the issue with the ingredients.  While I was checking out  totally unexpected Jan our tesco assistant  approached me and said she had spoken with her manager and as s good will gesture will give me the asparagus and broccoli for free.  Jan your a legend... Proper made my day with your above and beyond the call of duty action.   As they say every little bit helps  I would personally like to say a big Thank You 👏👏👏👏👏	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13726616_10153889901979075_5860180965992225950_n.jpg?oh=a804ecb70faf8913105407abe3607b6e&oe=58E8BAA4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13726616_10153889901979075_5860180965992225950_n.jpg?oh=2740d1878aab50cbe7e65c2db822bfc0&oe=58EEDCD0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153889901979075&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-15T21:51:00+0000	1468619460	2016-07-15 23:51:00	5	7	5	0	12	6	3	3	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Julie was on the Pay as you Shop tills  she called him over  asked him what happened. After a quick hug she cleaned his finger  put on a  magic plaster  the whispered to me for his name - she then wrote him a brave sticker which put a big smile on his face!!!!

However I was shocked to find that you do not stock the letter z. I have checked many tescos across Scotland and can still not find this letter! Please can you tell me why you are depriving people such as myself of an alphabet candle? Don t call them alphabet candles and not sell the full alphabet!

Tonight  4th visit  there was 1x6 pack on the shelf and funnily enough the special offer has finished. I know that I m not the only person who s sick of the half empty shelves in this store too.

I most certainly is not a medium spicy one like it says on your packet! It has Slices of Green Chilli..complete with seeds (That make it Hotter) Put on the top. Now it says to stir it..half way through cooking time. BUT! If you dont want it that hot..and you do not like a very hot burn your mouth out sensation...I advise people to pick the chilli slices out of it..or risk having your  head blown off with the heat of them! Please correct your packaging Tesco...It is NOT a medium one..by any stretch!					2016-07-15T15:46:24+0000	1468597584	2016-07-15 17:46:24	0	10	0	0	10	9	2	7	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It won t let me copy the link and automatically takes me to a registration website that looks like it belongs to Tesco..even puts the app image in the corner.  I have taken a screenshot to show you. I previously received 3 back in February and was advised to send to phishing@uktesco.com. When I tried this the mail is just bounced back. Wanted to make you and customers aware of this.

At £2.50  for me  it was pricey  but it taught me to love olives. It solved 2 major problems: one  I do not like the taste of brine and  two  I feel that un-pitted olives can be problematic when on the move. Over time I ended up buying at least 3 packs a week  meaning that I am currently spending over £350 a year on olives  which  on reflection  is excessive. But these packs not only ignited my passion for olives  they also reassured me I could bite with confidence - a confidence that was ultimately my undoing.   This Tuesday I approached my favourite snack with my usual sense of assurance but  unfortunately  my olives weren’t as hollow as the packaging promised  resulting in me losing half a tooth  but  more painfully  love for your product. Although I know this is simply an oversight and there was no malice on your part  I feel someone needs to take responsibility for this pitiful mistake (that was a pun by the way; I’m trying to make light of the situation but it’s hard).   If someone could get back to me about this it would be much appreciated and hopefully we can put this behind us.					2016-07-15T13:55:42+0000	1468590942	2016-07-15 15:55:42	16	3	20	0	23	3	1	2	1	0	16	2	0	0	1	1	0

Spoke to several people to be told different things the beginning of this week I asked about when delivery would be to be told I should hear within next 48hrs still nothing. So I ring up today to be told oh sorry I ve spoke to our supplier we haven t sent the order through!!!! So my 3 year old son now has another 2-3 weeks sleeping on the floor.

I was hoping to have received it by now so he can have a lovely room for his birthday. 😡😡😡					2016-07-15T13:39:22+0000	1468589962	2016-07-15 15:39:22	1	10	1	0	11	10	6	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was ready to be tucked away and used some time in the future  but I wanted to make fresh coffee and the jar was right next to ground coffee packet. Well  I might as well open it  I thought. The rest you can see below; I finished it in two days.. May I have more please? :) It was the most delicious  smooth and rich in taste chocolate spread I have ever had  and I am well-travelled. What a wonderful product!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13631381_274641259560248_136866502624097651_n.jpg?oh=650d90ed627f962c163b67f2db417ae3&oe=58EEE255	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13631381_274641259560248_136866502624097651_n.jpg?oh=db9a8475baa8756bc9677a5284268756&oe=58E57FA2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=274641259560248&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-15T13:35:07+0000	1468589707	2016-07-15 15:35:07	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So..this item is designed for kids.. so please tell me why the nutritional intake guidance is for adults? Is that not misleading? A child s intake is lower than adults  so stating it s 8% is not quite true as it would be higher for children.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13686535_10154137320336084_4363811822979551132_n.jpg?oh=ac84a9be2d8734e5d441902e7d0c4c80&oe=591FC13F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13686535_10154137320336084_4363811822979551132_n.jpg?oh=74354d7163e07db147d7bd00ec5916d5&oe=58E5ED4B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154137320336084&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-15T12:39:20+0000	1468586360	2016-07-15 14:39:20	2	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I regularly visit your Ilminster and Yeovil stores both in Somerset. I can never park in one of the parent and baby spaces at either store. I see parents of 8 or 9 year old children using them - they don t need the extra space! No car seats or prams. I see lazy people using them with no children at all whilst I struggle with my 7 month old and sometimes have to leave him to the side in his pram while I move my car forward in a regular space just to have enough room to get him into his car seat. I d be happy to walk from the back of the car park just to have the extra space. Maybe that s where you should put the larger parking bays and it may stop the simply lazy people from using them! Irate parent queueing for a space at the Yeovil store as I type! 😡😤					2016-07-15T12:36:18+0000	1468586178	2016-07-15 14:36:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please be aware that if you visit this store twice in one day you can be caught on camera entering the car park on first visit and on leaving on the second. This then means you are accused of parking all day and threatened with a fine. Tesco need to advise their security to recheck their cameras when there is a dispute instead of patronising their customers otherwise the customers won t be going in once a day never mind two.					2016-07-15T09:11:16+0000	1468573876	2016-07-15 11:11:16	1	6	1	0	7	6	6	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I reached into the bag  I felt a sharp spiking pain across my hand as though I had grabbed onto a thorn bush.  I was taken completely unaware  very confused and a bit scared about what could be inside the bag. Attached is one picture of the sharp thorned plant leaves that were in with my spinach.  If I had eaten the leaves I could have very severely cut my mouth and throat. I am left with sore pains in my hand and red spiked marks. I am very upset and disappointed and will not be shopping at Tesco again and similarly recommending to my friends they do the same. This was a seriously dangerous health hazard and as a loyal customer I feel very let down. I have several more photos along with the one in the post.

Very disappointed as needed it to feed my little girl.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13680839_1935745209785759_1753878393435663279_n.jpg?oh=1f87eaf7b03be8b6edd113bd0cece8c6&oe=58EBC2AC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13680839_1935745209785759_1753878393435663279_n.jpg?oh=d8a479b01b23b8e41bd597ad5a1aaeef&oe=5921D4B9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1935745209785759&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-15T08:37:48+0000	1468571868	2016-07-15 10:37:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You have notices up in all stores that state  milk helps dairy cows . This is a lie as you are know doubt well aware. In order for a cow to produce milk it has to have a calf. These calfs are separated from their mothers within 24 hours  causing immense suffering to both the calf and the cow. Both of which cry for days afterwards. Can you image what it would be like if we did this to humans!  Now think of how many cows be have in this country that are suffering in this way.  Once separated from the mother cow  the calf ( if male) is either shot or sent to barbaric veal units abroad. If female she will have to endure enforced artificial insemination and go through many many pregnancies. After only are few years they are classed as  spent  and are sent for slaughter. The few Bulls that are kept for breeding are forced to produce sperm via penile electrocution. Please take down all of these notices.					2016-07-15T08:20:01+0000	1468570801	2016-07-15 10:20:01	3	16	3	0	19	15	4	11	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  I request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows. Otherwise we will have little alternative but to register a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.  Yours faithfully   David Shaw					2016-07-15T08:18:59+0000	1468570739	2016-07-15 10:18:59	5	2	5	0	7	2	2	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I searched how to complain and started reading many complaints about the behaviour of tesco drivers. I was amazed that such a big company allows their staff to behave in such a manner  they can be abusive  aggressive  and rude  is it because they are alone and not being managed? lorry drivers are more curtious on the roads.  The man wearing mid grey sunglasses  driving  along Curzon Road Maidstone at 9:05 am was driving too fast  very aggressive  commanding me to move out his way   and has an extremely bad attitude  he needs sacking   I would not want him advertising for my company.  Tesco stop ignoring these bad reviews and and do something about it.  He told me you have speed tracking on the vehicle why not a camera.  every bad driver  delivering 10 times a day  1 bad incident is 1 less customer. should I complain to Teso? Well what would you do about it  it seams you do nothing.					2016-07-15T07:58:25+0000	1468569505	2016-07-15 09:58:25	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Picture this - your son is turning 3 on the 15th of July  and has been desperate for a  big trampoline ... You manage to find a perfect 8 foot trampoline instore at tesco for £80  you double check online and see that tesco have an identical trampoline for instore collection for £10 cheaper  you go ahead and order it  feeling very happy that it will be ready for collection for the 14th  and you saved yourself a tenner win run... You plan to collect and set it up that evening ready to surprise said 3 year old on the morning of his birthday... You collect the trampoline and when you go to set it up you find that the box says (1/2) uh oh.... It s 9pm  you rush to tesco to sort this error out and collect the missing package  only to discover it is missing!!!!! You inform them of the identical trampoline instore but you re sent away on the promise that a manager would call you within the next 10 minutes to sort this all out  you leave stressed and worried! You get a call back and told that there isn t much that can be done due to the fact it was an online order  you tell them that considering there is an identical trampoline in store that you re sure (given Tesco s  every little helps  motto) that they can help rectify this error tonight to ensure a child won t have their only wanted birthday present missing when they wake up?   NO - this is where the disappointed (to say the least) comes in  you re then told that this would need to be passed to the night manager as its coming up to 10pm but are promised a call back as soon as its passed to him  time ticks on and by 10:30pm getting increasingly frustrated you call the night manager to be met with him not knowing much about the situation and the only thing he can repeat is that NOTHING can be done!!! He slips in that no one is trained on the click and collect desk after 10pm and this is the reason  realising you were in about this whole mess BEFORE 10pm you are left very angry and upset  met with no empathy or understanding you have no choice but to hang up and face the reality of letting your son wake up on his birthday with his longed for present missing due to TESCO s incompetency!!!  I am clearly very upset and angry at this situation and feel social media is the only avenue I can access at this time.  I d love to hear a response!  One angry mum!					2016-07-14T22:31:17+0000	1468535477	2016-07-15 00:31:17	0	7	8	1	16	7	4	3	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	8	0

She was struggling to walk with her crutches. A member of staff came over asking if we were ok and offered her a wheel chair. Then showed her how to use it and even offered to push her. Peter K . You are a star.  The service didn t stop there .... He came looking for us after a while to make sure we were still ok. After I paid for our shopping we collected my daughters crutches from customer service desk Peter then came to us and pushed my daughter out of the store to the car helped her into the car and took the wheelchair and trolley back. This man is a credit to Tesco and I really want him to be recognised. It is service like this that puts your beverley store at the top.

I went into town to day with my friend and her little lad and decided to get us all a meal deal  cheap and cheerful  we all got the same sandwich a chicken and bacon mayo.  Now I ve only just opened mine as I filled up on the crisps  and I m shocked to say my first bite I found a bone!! A small bone that if given to my friends young lad could have chocked him!   After looking at the packaging I haven t seen any warnings for bones just allergies.   You have lost a customer  and I hope this gets looked into further.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13686507_221030734962835_4281851521810599892_n.jpg?oh=cf6e84f26f9a1cd9cc426bc625351c6a&oe=58EA0982	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13686507_221030734962835_4281851521810599892_n.jpg?oh=09354092dfbd654d7b3b527f93c29bcd&oe=5919DC7D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=221030734962835&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-14T19:38:56+0000	1468525136	2016-07-14 21:38:56	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received a called to say it was cancelled and refunded immediately on Tesco side over a week ago. Got a voicemail saying it has just been cancelled and I should get a confirmation email which I still haven t got. Still out of pocket for over a week. When will you give me my money back Tesco. Not the best online experience. I rather stay with Amazon for my next online purchases.

I picked up the Lay z spa Vegas from them last week ready for my daughters birthday party this weekend  my husband has blown it up filled it will water and started to heat it up as it takes a while. We noticed water on the floor at the back which we thought was from the hose and I jokingly said have we a leak?.... Well yes we do have a leak a big one now covering most of the underneath  my husband rang customer enquirers to be told that it could be replaced but not till Monday as it needed 2 men  whilst I appreciate this its of no use to me  my daughter and her friends as I now have no hot tub to use for her hot tub party. I m extremely upset and so is my soon to be 7yr old. One very upset and dissatisfied customer.

Writing this in the hope that something gets done 😞					2016-07-14T17:49:39+0000	1468518579	2016-07-14 19:49:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a bag of sweets that I picked up and headed upstairs to the clothing  where I picked up some pyjamas I wanted to buy.  I went to the cash desk  there was only one person on the till serving and a very very slow moving queue.  The staff - Sharon was her name  I found was proving to look like she didn t want to be at work at all. No customer service  no smile  nothing!  Once it got to my turn  after waiting about 20 minutes  she just took my items and scanned them  then made a comment about the sweets I had put on the desk  you re not meant to pay for these here it s got to be downstairs  but I ll do it today  in the most monotone voice I ve ever heard. And also  there is no sign in the store stating that I couldn t pay for the sweets upstairs. With this being said - there was a man before me in the queue and he had purchased milk and oranges and nothing was said to him!  I am pretty disappointed in the service today and has put me off visiting your store!  Nothing like service with a smile!👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽					2016-07-14T17:47:15+0000	1468518435	2016-07-14 19:47:15	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My husband put this product in the oven following the instructions printed in the outer sleeve. When he went to check the chicken after 5 minutes  the plastic container had melted and a large amount of smoke followed! This clearly isn t the correct way to cook the product and thankfully he checked on it after 5 minutes as it could have been much worse!! I have added photos to explain my issue further! Photo of Tesco instructions in the comments section as I could only upload one!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13680736_10153945203027880_1636264885972229451_n.jpg?oh=f9e722e2e0f72677198c8fb176b16a9a&oe=58EB80AE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13680736_10153945203027880_1636264885972229451_n.jpg?oh=246071420c7d84650a377461f0eeb4da&oe=58DDD2A3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153945203027880&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-14T17:08:29+0000	1468516109	2016-07-14 19:08:29	0	17	0	0	17	13	4	9	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased a few items at the self service machine and the lady that was working really needs a lesson in customer service. Our machine alerted that we needed help and she casually strolled past a number of times not paying attention at all. In the end my husband had to walk up to her to ask for help. We finally got her attention however there was absolutely no sign of a smile and she didn t speak one word to us at all. I don t know why you employ people who obviously don t want to be there or why you believe this is a good way for your customers to be treated. Very disappointed! I m glad we only visited as we were in the area!					2016-07-14T15:41:57+0000	1468510917	2016-07-14 17:41:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I paid £31 more than other companies were charging plus the delivery fee to Tesco as you were the only company offering next day delivery and I need the item by Saturday. I arranged for somebody to be present today to take the delivery. Mid morning I received an email from DPD informing me that although they were due to deliver to me today they could not as they had not received the item from Tesco. I phoned Tesco and was inform that there is an ongoing problem with DPD and that she believed they are currently running 24 hours behind schedule. She could not confirm if DPD do have the item or if Tesco still have it  nor could she tell me when I will receive it. So as it stands I am around £300 out of pocket with no idea when I will receive my item!!! Seriously disappointed in the service I have received so far!					2016-07-14T15:11:20+0000	1468509080	2016-07-14 17:11:20	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Never have I had a problem in the 20 months of using them until I got this new pack!! They leak so easily and after changing my little girl  and putting her to bed ... I went to check on her 1 hour later and the nappy was like this  with half the inside .. Now outside!!   She hadn t been wrestling about  and the nappy was still relatively dry!!!   What ever you have changed  please change it back!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13680898_10154459749016996_187971270839568424_n.jpg?oh=03440ed649a7cbf8ac8e9afa546fcb0e&oe=58DEC3FA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13680898_10154459749016996_187971270839568424_n.jpg?oh=bc20327e8cad1b6fda9318ab517650d7&oe=5921B3EF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154459749016996&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-14T15:02:20+0000	1468508540	2016-07-14 17:02:20	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After shopping in their Coppetts Wood superstore for almost 30 years  I slipped and fell on a patch of fluid  which was barely visible. I reported this to a member of  staff  who was doing online shopping and she advised me to report this to customer services  which I did and she promptly mopped up the spillage. Since then Tesco have arrogantly denied responsibility  making out that I am a liar  going on about there strict safety and cleaning procedures!  Apparently there was no CCTV in place. Funny that  because if there was they would have seen me fall! I have Ostioathritis in my spine and the fall caused me a great deal of pain and stress!  I won t be shopping in any of their stores ever again! the customer services is very poor too!  The staff  come across as dismissive and unhelpful most of the time!

I was left red faced and angry yesterday after one of your assistants took one look at my Clydesdale bank £20 note and said he couldn t take it. He then gave the same reaction to my Royal Bank of Scotland note and said I ve never seen one of those before. What a £20 note? Train your staff! This might reduce the lengthy queues building up behind people like myself and reduce the embarrassment of having to ask your staff to call on a manager to verify that my hard earned money is not fake or fraudulent. Scottish and northern Irish money at this present time should be acceptable in all stores both north and south of the border.					2016-07-14T07:15:26+0000	1468480526	2016-07-14 09:15:26	14	26	15	1	42	26	6	20	26	0	14	0	1	0	0	0	0

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  We request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows. Otherwise we will have little alternative but to register a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.  Yours faithfully  Monique					2016-07-14T05:34:56+0000	1468474496	2016-07-14 07:34:56	8	6	8	0	14	6	4	2	8	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Vegan cheese  vegan Quorn and vegan falafel wraps can be bought in many Tesco stores.  It does  of course  also cater for the vast majority of people who have few or no qualms about eating animal products.  Almost all vegans started out as meat eaters so we understand from direct personal experience the  see no evil  hear no evil  speak no evil  mindset that insulates the consciences of meat eaters from the underlying horror of animal farming.  We understand  even if we do not approve of  Tesco s inevitable participation for the time being in this evil.  However now Tesco have taken this a step further and invited their customers to consume cows milk on the basis that  Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  This is worthy of Josef Goebbels!  The dairy industry ranges between cruel and diabolical.  It s objective is not to make life good for cows!					2016-07-13T21:48:15+0000	1468446495	2016-07-13 23:48:15	7	5	7	0	12	4	3	1	8	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am writing to express my concern at one of your products that I purchased this evening. Whilst in Tesco for some urgent supplies  my stomach reminded me I hadn t yet had my after dinner snack. It s almost 10pm and I hadn t had chocolate yet! As natural as anything  I went for a snickers bar. In my haste  I had forgotten that just last night I had signed up for the Body Coach s 90 day lifestyle change plan  so upon remembering as I approached the till  I put down the snickers and opted for something a little better for me  namely an  Apple and strawberry  pot. That should do it(!) it took a lot of willpower believe me. I paid and ran to the car to get my fix. I popped a strawberry in my mouth. You can imagine my horror when I m greeted with a rancid taste of hollow strawberry. I swallow it down and grab an apple to hide the taste  which tasted just as bad. I m left thinking  what on earth am I eating here!? I turn the light on in my car to see some thing I think USED to be a strawberry (perhaps many moons ago). I enclose a photo I took upon returning home for your pleasure. Not only did I eat one of these  I now have to throw the pack away and I m a golden nugget down. Yes  I shouldn t have bought something  fresh  at almost 10pm... But wtf you selling it for? I could have also taken back into the shop  but I was missing Big Brother and needed to get home.   I m holding out for the safe return of my golden nugget.. And maybe some fresh fruit in return.  Yours sincerely  Mark Hall	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13680931_10154310390443767_380944580287129101_n.jpg?oh=8df0ba6ce4c5a5fd836764ecd2466e43&oe=58E2D256	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13680931_10154310390443767_380944580287129101_n.jpg?oh=e4802c8edd8728b751beb3e8f82b0968&oe=58DCBC2A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154310390443767&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-13T21:24:58+0000	1468445098	2016-07-13 23:24:58	5	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please watch  Cowspiracy  and try plant based milk- tesco sell them too and they re delicious.					2016-07-13T21:12:47+0000	1468444367	2016-07-13 23:12:47	7	3	7	0	10	3	1	2	3	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have used this store for many years and whitest it s not my favourite place it is local. Since they have introduced Shop and Scan I have practically been in there every day.   On Sunday I forgot to scan six bottles of Cider and they have now banned me from using it. I did tell the assistant that I think I had forgotten to scan something and to check and when she scanned to approve the alcohol I told that was it. At no point did she tell me it was a problem so I didn t know until today when I tried to used it again.   The staff in the store was not helpful at all and said  we cannot help you in the store . This seems to be the standard line for all complaints.  Eventually I got to she the manageress Wendy who unbelievably said this seems like not the first time it s happened. I asked for them to substantiate this claim because it was completely untrue as I have used it every day had many random checks and all has always been ok. She said she didn t have to justify it and it was their discretion to refuse it use.   So I did my shopping at ASDA where I I ll from now on.   I will be taking this further with a request for information on data shared about me and have already complained about it to your customer services.   I await a full apology and acknowledgements that the statements and actions where inaccurate  inappropriate and unjust.

Using your lamb and mint koftas we have had these before and they make a nice change once in a while. Luckily tonight we didn t share our dinner with my baby as there were splinters of wood and bone all through out I have lined the skewers up so you can see they have not broken up or splintered so somewhere within production one has clearly broken up and been mixed with the meat. I dread to think how this could have ended if my baby had of eaten this. I look forward to a promt response I have also taken pictures of packaging and bar codes should you need them.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13707707_10157156390475717_4122059770285697859_n.jpg?oh=b54872158b29fc2e15f3ca2c8e5e5f68&oe=58D5C639	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13707707_10157156390475717_4122059770285697859_n.jpg?oh=a35aee53b4185e135017d774aca0fba5&oe=58D70834	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157156390475717&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-13T19:21:04+0000	1468437664	2016-07-13 21:21:04	3	4	8	1	13	3	1	2	2	0	3	0	3	0	0	2	0

The woman on the phone (didn t give her name) was lovely and had fantastic customer service no questions asked tried to order the item again which was out of stock so ordered me some shirts rather then the poloshirts I ordered.

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  I request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows.   Yours faithfully   Lauren Robinson					2016-07-13T16:54:31+0000	1468428871	2016-07-13 18:54:31	10	11	10	0	21	10	2	8	1	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly Saturday I bought strawberries and apples to use in pimms  I used both with half an hour of purchasing.  The strawberries were mushy and the pack of 6 apples only contained 5 and a half. My husband then purchased some nectarines on Sunday   again we got short changed on the fruit (see pictures). You have made up all these fancy farms for some reason but the quality is shocking.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13690780_10154371201936803_4364598014977186735_n.jpg?oh=52f0d30d505c2c6238891e16b11cff9c&oe=58E81F87	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13690780_10154371201936803_4364598014977186735_n.jpg?oh=cfe946e23eac4bef77ed6e283915d674&oe=5918488A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154371201936803&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-13T16:29:37+0000	1468427377	2016-07-13 18:29:37	0	11	1	0	12	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

I spoke with a very helpful young man on the phone but the only information he could give me was that the cardigans must have just gone out of stock and the next delivery is not due for a further 4 weeks. If I ordered these  when available  they will not arrive for the start of our next school year  18th August.   I did look into buying non-embroidered from your website but these do not come in royal blue  knitted and there is no option to purchase a non-embroidered jersey cardigan.   I find this absolutely unacceptable as the same situation occurred last summer and our school were informed that this would not happen again this year  clearly not true!   Can someone please let me know how  and why  this has been allowed to happen for the 2nd year  that I know of  in a row?!					2016-07-13T14:35:25+0000	1468420525	2016-07-13 16:35:25	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I d been sent some money off vouchers I thought I d give it a go to save some time. Turns out it takes so much more time to shop with you online  most of the morning in fact  the system seems to be having technical errors  tried to make the payment a number of times only to receive a note that you re experiencing some issues. In the mean time I ve lost the delivery slot and there are no collection slots available any time tomorrow. So I ll have to go back to my old faithful and do my shop in person with another store.

I was disgusted! Not only was there boxes just left in the middle of an isle but there where piles of newspapers left in the middle of another isle  isles taken up with stock trolleys. I know they need to go somewhere but this is health and safety issues! If I had taken my elderly grandparents into tescos they would have fallen and seriously hurt themselves. I was disgusted! The staff there seem to have lost interest in keeping the Isles clear. There would have been no access for a wheelchair or pushchair to go through most of the isles. I was actually very shocked with this. These are the better isles. The ones with less things in the middle. The floor was wet and in these pictures you can see the  wet floor  sign was on its side. Unable to see it properly. I was seriously unimpressed. Tesco need to pluck up their ideas or have staff that actually care about what they are doing and making the place safe.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13626985_10206089119017627_3790055167739540148_n.jpg?oh=74391a686c1b29f319149f62c2986d89&oe=58E8D2ED	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13626985_10206089119017627_3790055167739540148_n.jpg?oh=9cf55507123c5628fbe23bdd5a563d3c&oe=58DF8DE0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206089119017627&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-13T10:39:56+0000	1468406396	2016-07-13 12:39:56	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the most cruel and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are then considered ‘spent’ and then they are slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Please stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. I request that you immediately remove every one of these labels from your shops  or alternatively place them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows.  Thank you   Sincerely  Irene Parsons.					2016-07-13T09:20:54+0000	1468401654	2016-07-13 11:20:54	8	3	8	2	13	3	2	1	6	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I use to do online shopping for groceries with you from time to time. So far everything was good  helpful drivers  most items always in stock  usually in agreed time slot. Until yesterday. And just to be clear  I do not tend to write complains online  but I am just super extremely disappointed with your yesterday services. First of all  my delivery (order number 20836447) should come between 21-22. Driver called earlier to ask if he could come before agreed time which I needed to refuse as I was still on my way home  I do told him though that if its more convenient for him I do not mind to get my groceries being delivered a bit later though. But after 22:30 I got a bit worried about my order as no one come so I start calling the driver (07703798262) & left him txt message as well. No reply. I contact you through your website (Reference ID: 2613148)  but still no reply. Instead of that I got an email how much I saved by shopping with you (?) even though I haven t received anything and spend over 60Ł. Can someone please have a look into it as I am already starving without my breakfast  so you can imagine how upset I am.					2016-07-13T09:17:49+0000	1468401469	2016-07-13 11:17:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought an iron via Tesco Mere Way Northampton approx 6 months ago - Russell Hobbs Steamglide 18742 model. had it six months. Baseplate supposed to be non stick  nothing could be further from the truth nor can it be cleaned. I have tried all approved methods but it still picks up bits whilst ironing it then deposits on other clothing - we are only talking about domestic ironing! having to rewash my daughters white Kararte Ghi yet again as the iron has left black marks on it even after extensive cleaning. the baseplate is stained just from normal use. the base cannot be cleaned no is it non stick! Quite the opposite in fact! Great and to top it off it has just burnt a hole through a school shirt as the thermostat seems to have failed ruining a almost new shirt!   The product is utter rubbish!					2016-07-13T09:15:01+0000	1468401301	2016-07-13 11:15:01	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is obviously not the case and I am sure you know that  so there is no reason for me to discuss the abuse element on here.  You have generally been supportive of vegans and made food available for us  this ad is not only untrue  but it is also alienating. It is dangerous to give your customers the idea they are making a strong ethical choice for welfare reasons when the opposite is true.

Again it instantly ripped - with 3 young children we don t have much free time to keep taking these items back for replacement and although they are reasonably priced  the quality is clearly very poor so if possible could we arrange for a refund for them?

This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  We request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows. Otherwise we will have little alternative but to register a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.

In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  This is not CARING for cows.					2016-07-13T07:01:29+0000	1468393289	2016-07-13 09:01:29	12	27	12	1	40	25	8	17	31	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered an online shop yesterday morning to be delivered yesterday evening. After checking the delivery note it appears I have been charged full price for 8 items instead of the promotional price it was showing on the website  and the price it was added to my basket as. After calling up to rectify this I was told that those offers didn t start until today  and because I got them delivered yesterday they were still full price! If that s the case then why did it let me add them to my basket at the promotional price? Now I have to mess around going to store with my 2 week old baby just to return these items and get a refund! So disappointed.					2016-07-13T06:56:59+0000	1468393019	2016-07-13 08:56:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I came in to send off two parcels from the post office concession you have in the store. The one parcel wasn t wrapped as I couldn t find anything for it to go in  so I approached a young man in a suit and asked if they sold any. He searched all round store for me but unfortunately he couldn t see any. He then walked me all the way over to the post office at the back of the store (stopped what he was doing) and told the lady behind the counter what I was looking for.   When I approached the lady behind the desk Tina  I joked with her that I was going to be that  nightmare customer  and she continued to joke with me and was so cheery at 10am on a Monday morning! She then went on to search for a bag / box for me to put my item in. The young man who I originally approached continued to search too.  She eventually found something for me  and at no extra cost she helped me wrap my item and sort out my paperwork. At the same time she just chatted away to me and showed genuine interest in what I had to say.  As a customer service manager myself  I d just like to say what an absolute asset Tina is to your store (and the young gentleman who helped too). Her customer service is outstanding  and never have I felt so valued as a customer. Usually I would pop next door to Saintsbury s as I generally find it cheaper  however from no on I will be a loyal Tesco shopper  as service like that needs to be recognised and rewarded.   I really hope that you pass this on to Tina and reward her as a company yourselves  as she is one hell of a lady and if everyone in customer service was like her then the world would be a better place! I bought her a box of chocolates to say thank you - the first time I have ever done that based on someone s service.  You should be extremely proud to say she is a member of your team.  Thank you again Tina  and thank you Tesco for employing someone so fantastic! Keep it up!!

Dairy cows are one of the most exploited of farmed animals; in order to produce milk they re made pregnant every year and their calves taken away from them. Cruelty and extreme suffering are inherent in this industry and so buying dairy directly contributes to this. I urge you to put an end to this campaign  which makes such inaccurate claims.					2016-07-13T05:58:38+0000	1468389518	2016-07-13 07:58:38	7	2	7	0	9	2	2	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

The first aid people were lovely they got the ambulance & mum was taken to hospital because her blood pressure was so high they were very worried. The manager got my bread & a grill pan we d gone in for. Tesco phoned this morning to see how we were & said he d watched the cctv briefly & could see us falling  they d tested the trolley a few times & couldn t find anything wrong but it had happened last Saturday with someone else & the people backed up & a baby fell out of the trolley when it tipped over  but Tesco didn t see anything wrong. Oh & it happened a few weeks ago with an older lady but Tesco couldn t find anything wrong. Can you see a pattern forming ? The fact it happened once should have alerted their H & S but No not Tesco it s dreadful they are blaming other people the duty manager rang today said about older people not being as agile & maybe didn t have the strength to push the trolley off  I said hang on I tried moving that trolley & so did the man behind us the only time that trolley moved was when the security guy switched the escalator off. !!

Online order messed up (not for first time)  so they sent me a voucher which I used against next order.  This next order then had around 12 items missing (all refrigerated) and presumably left on van.  Called up and told that someone from store would contact me that day and get items to me.  End of next day  no call received so went out and purchased items myself.  Still no call so rather annoyed I called customer service to get a refund on undelivered items. Offered refund and told it had been escalated and someone from store would call.  Have since called about 3 or 4 times and each time very apologetic and explain that has been escalated but no call back. One month on and no call back so called up to cancel delivery subscription and have just placed order with Sainsburys who I shall use from now on.....still no call from Tesco.  Be warned and don t expect good service if things go wrong with your order.					2016-07-12T22:47:45+0000	1468363665	2016-07-13 00:47:45	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was really gobsmacked to see your promotion of cows milk supposedly helping cows. In simple terms  can you explain how taking a cows baby off her  traumatising her and the calf  and then stealing the milk intended for the calf  is actually helping that cow? Who is a devastated mother  and who will endure that devastation again and again until she becomes unproductive and is slaughtered?

I suspect Morrisons  just down the road will be our destination  or maybe even Asda in Hayle. We had hoped that we would be within walking distance of the store but it seems I m not welcome! I was told in no uncertain terms that footwear was compulsory and I could not shop there. Even though I offered to sign a disclaimer absolving the store of any responsibility for my decision I was not allowed to continue shopping  but was escorted to the doors by the security guard.  I was able to discuss the matter with the Duty Manager and whilst he was far more understanding I sensed his hands were tied. I explained I go barefoot for 7 or 8 months a year and have been barefooting for well over 40 years. I also work barefoot as a handyman and very rarely have a problem. If I do cut my feet they bleed for a short while then it stops.  When he tried to tell me that Tesco try to take care of all their customers I explained I was prepared to take responsibility for my actions and really didn t need molly-coddling.  He was very helpful and went & found the reading glasses the store stocked so I could choose a pair and purchase at Customer Service desk -  this had been my only reason for coming in as I had broken my existing pair earlier in the day.  I have used both the above-mentioned stores without a problem and was even able to explain my position satisfactorily to a manager in Asda who commented that  he wouldn t forget me . As someone who is used to being accepted in all sorts of stores  including builder s merchants I find it sad that I am banned from a supermarket.					2016-07-12T22:11:40+0000	1468361500	2016-07-13 00:11:40	0	23	3	0	26	19	8	11	19	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0

Once he had left the cashier commented to the man in front of me that  obviously the Government is giving them plenty of money . I decided to respond to this  pointing out that the Government isn t giving anyone very much money and that her comments were not appropriate.  I find it depressing that anyone should hold such intolerant attitudes  let alone feel that they could share them with complete strangers while in their workplace  wearing your uniform.					2016-07-12T21:19:15+0000	1468358355	2016-07-12 23:19:15	4	20	6	0	26	20	1	19	17	0	4	0	1	0	0	1	0

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  We request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows.

Whilst I understand that paying a  fair  price to dairy farmers is something many people care strongly about  this is a gross misrepresentation of the fact that Tesco aim only to support farmers  profits  and not to care for cows.   How could an industry which requires cows to be repeatedly impregnated  only for their newborn calves to be removed  killed and grieved for by their mothers  possibly be described as  caring ? Please remove this lie from your shop shelves. If you must  replace it with a slogan about giving a better price to dairy farmers  but please do not try to portray the physical and psychological torment inflicted on millions of dairy cows as  care .   By the way  I d like to thank you for having a great range of dairy free yoghurts  cheeses and milk for those who do not want to support the cruelty of the dairy industry!					2016-07-12T20:35:10+0000	1468355710	2016-07-12 22:35:10	21	0	21	0	21	0	0	0	0	0	20	0	0	0	0	0	0

What a disgusting and deceitful statement. Every pint of milk seals the tragic fate of female cows  who are artificially inseminated  give birth to babies that are stolen from them to be sold for veal  babies that they literally cry and wail for the loss of. They are genetically manipulated to produce unnatural amounts of milk that cause their udders to swell a hugely uncomfortable amount  resulting in infection and indescribable pain and discomfort. This cycle of abuse goes on and on until the poor creatures are too mentally and physically exhausted to continue  and when they are no longer a profitable commodity with nothing to exploit  they too are sent to slaughter like the precious babies they ve spent their lives mourning. Your advert is repulsive  to say it s false advertising is an understatement and it should be withdrawn immediately.					2016-07-12T20:27:55+0000	1468355275	2016-07-12 22:27:55	18	0	18	0	18	0	0	0	0	0	18	0	0	0	0	0	0

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  We request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows. Otherwise we will have little alternative but to register a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.

Highly unethical when I m sure you know the suffering endured by dairy cows. Every pint in no way  helps  them  it just prolongs their suffering. The way to actually help then would be to buy plant-based alternatives. I m very disappointed.					2016-07-12T17:16:39+0000	1468343799	2016-07-12 19:16:39	29	2	29	0	31	1	1	0	0	0	27	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am boycotting Tesco until all of these signs are removed from all stores. I wouldn t p*ss Vegans off - there are half a million of us in the UK now and growing. Massive market share to lose.					2016-07-12T17:14:20+0000	1468343660	2016-07-12 19:14:20	23	1	23	0	24	1	1	0	0	0	22	0	0	0	0	0	0

To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.					2016-07-12T17:09:37+0000	1468343377	2016-07-12 19:09:37	23	3	23	0	26	2	2	0	3	0	22	0	0	0	0	0	0

Dairy farming sends calves to the veal industry and milk cows for slaughter well before their natural time. I have been a loyal customer of yours for all my adult life but I will not step foot in another Tesco store until this campaign is scrapped.

The text below stated ‘If it’s cheaper at Asda  Morrisons or Sainsbury’s  we’ll take the money off your bill at the till’. It also featured a character holding an icon that carried the text ‘Brand Guarantee’.  The small print  however  stated: “Minimum basket of 10 different products  including one comparable branded product. Total price of branded grocery shop compared with Asda  Morrisons and Sainsbury’s and if cheaper elsewhere the difference will be taken off your bill.”  The ad was investigated after a complaint from Sainsbury’s. It argued that the ad did not make the minimum purchase restriction sufficiently clear and challenged whether the claim “Never pay more for your branded shop” was misleading. my wife today went to Tesco in pontardawe swansea in order to buy a product which was advertised cheaper at another well known supermarket but was unable to do so as Tesco deliberately misled the public in the advert which is explained above  all I can say is goodbye Tesco and cant wait for the big new LIDL supermarket to open as I feel this will spell the death knell of Tesco pontardawe					2016-07-12T14:26:35+0000	1468333595	2016-07-12 16:26:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon checking them when I returned home  one of them was faulty and I then noticed they were also locked to Tesco Mobile  which I wasn t aware of. I took them back to a store and discussed how I would be refunded  by speaking with Tesco Direct on the phone. We agreed the best way forward was to issue me with a voucher for the amount of the boost  as the phones were a present for my twins  birthday  which is this Thursday 14 July. This has now been an ongoing issue because instead  Tesco decided to award me in points on my next statement  which of course is no good to me.  Upon telephoning numerous times to be told you have emailed me the voucher / to BT Internet not accepting Tesco emails (which is rubbish) / to be told I will get it the next day and not getting it  I have finally spoken with Peter Richards user NS02  who very kindly managed to sort out the issue for me. HOWEVER  due to the aforementioned incompetence on your behalf  there ARE NO PHONES LEFT IN STOCK 😡. I am extremely angry because you have left me in a position where I will have to physically pay for a phone elsewhere  which was the whole point using the boost  so I would only have to purchase one  when had you have sorted out the issue immediately  I wouldn t have to. It is their birthday on Thursday so thank you Tesco.  I would like to know how you are going to rectify this situation for me please.

I just had a fantastic customer service moment at main tesco in Banbury today. The lovely lady working the selfservice check outs scanned and packed my bags for me as Maxwell (3 years old) had decided to fall asleep on me! Not many genuinely helpful people out there nowadays. Made my day. Thank you so much.					2016-07-12T13:19:33+0000	1468329573	2016-07-12 15:19:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She replied sometimes it works I am not saying all Tesco checkout operatives are like this but Tesco do seem to have cornered the market in the type who need to prove the customer wrong. No wonder Aldi are so popular.					2016-07-12T13:17:55+0000	1468329475	2016-07-12 15:17:55	1	8	1	0	9	8	3	5	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We didn t believe her that it was like eating plastic  we will never doubt her again. Another 2 of us tried them and honestly I think eating tree bark would be easier an tastier. Normally love sweet potato products but these crisps are neither sweet or potato like. They are however very crisp  although if you only have a normal set if teeth I would avoid them.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13626993_10209527885421472_8414691078120393270_n.jpg?oh=44d2ee503a9cfc157a3cc69b9a8639b1&oe=5923429C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13626993_10209527885421472_8414691078120393270_n.jpg?oh=d36ac09fe10f594282a3c70b02ca4ccc&oe=58DC1891	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209527885421472&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-12T12:50:27+0000	1468327827	2016-07-12 14:50:27	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please note that the cars underneath were parked in family spaces and the trolleys were still being used by customers to put their their food in despite their proximity to raw sewage and the likelihood of splashes of raw sewage being on them. Please do consider getting the pipes properly fixed and deep cleaning your store and the trolleys - I would also make the deep clean as public as possible! I won t be going back there until this store and the trolleys are properly clean and I will be spreading the message as this is a public health issue!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13669128_10157030422415004_3258169073830923167_n.jpg?oh=eede4671a15d3db843f3fd554d1bb720&oe=591F5A32	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13669128_10157030422415004_3258169073830923167_n.jpg?oh=5dbe96827c354dd0d33c6c17c7baeebc&oe=58D74B3F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157030422415004&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-12T12:39:01+0000	1468327141	2016-07-12 14:39:01	2	11	5	10	26	9	5	4	9	0	2	0	3	0	0	0	0

I just thought I d mention something I saw in your Borehamwood branch on Saturday night  in the hope you ll organise some hygiene talks for your staff.  As I was making my way to the tills I walked past your sandwich fridge  opposite the newspaper stand  and was stunned to see one of your employees scratching his bottom.  And I don t just mean a little itch on the side  he was really getting into the crack and having a good old rummage around!  He then reached out to touch something on the sandwich stand.  I was absolutely shocked and sickened to be honest  and even more surprised that it didn t occur to him that it was unacceptable.  The fact he didn t even seem to care that people were around suggests this is a regular thing.  I didn t feel able to go up and speak to him about it  so please  can you deal with it and talk to your staff!  I really think they d benefit from a few hygiene lessons! If you want times so you can look back at CCTV just let me know and I ll check my receipt when I get home.  Thanking you.					2016-07-12T10:03:23+0000	1468317803	2016-07-12 12:03:23	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Thanks for all the beautiful messages  prayers  likes  calls  lunch dates  presents and visits.  I appreciate everyone that has taken a moment to celebrate me. I want you all to pray for Matt a cool guy that works at Tesco Highwoods Colchester.  This is how I met Matt who was a true gentleman going about his job at Tesco.  I went to get my prescriptions and I was also looking for some insecticide spray.  I saw Matt and asked him where I could find the spray  he gave me the direction and then decided to hold my basket which had my handbag  two packets of muffins as I was also using my walking stick. He asked if I had anything else to do while I was there and I said I wanted to pick my prescriptions from the pharmacy.  As we walked to the pharmacy   I asked for his name and he said it was Matt. He then said to me that he can go and get the raid insecticide for me while I waited at the pharmacy to save me the journey. I said that was very kind of him. I told him he just made my birthday just easier and special due to his attention and generosity to me.   Guess what? Well Matt came back with not only the insecticide but a birthday cake he had paid for and he gave it to me and wished me happy birthday.  I was speechless as it was a beautiful selfless gesture I was not expecting .  So I told him him thank you and asked God to bless him.  Then the pharmacy ladies who have come to know me due to my many medications and visits realised it was my birthday as my date of birth was on the prescriptions I came to collect wished me happy birthday .   I felt really blessed.					2016-07-12T08:23:25+0000	1468311805	2016-07-12 10:23:25	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

What s the policy on opening food on the way around with a toddler? I always pay for it and if it s something by weight  get the sticker first. Also had to buy a tomato one day (no one in the house likes them) because she picked one up and buy into it :o Just wanted to know because I don t want to get in trouble  buy it is preventing a loud protest which would upset other customers I think.

I haven t seen this in any other store so if it s a local initiative the person responsible should be commended.

The first delivery had a vital piece missing  it took 3 weeks to have another one delivered but the delivery was inexplicably cancelled the day before it was due. After 2 of your customer support people not bothering to call us back as promised we finally spoke to a very helpful lady who arranged to have the trampoline delivered within 3 days. It arrived today in 2 boxes  only 1 box is for the 10 foot trampoline we ordered and the other box contains parts for an 8 foot trampoline!! This was supposed to be my son s birthday present and he has now been let down 3 times! He was incredibly disappointed the first 2 times it was cocked up and I am dreading telling him tomorrow morning that you got it wrong for a third time and he can t have his trampoline.					2016-07-11T21:31:33+0000	1468272693	2016-07-11 23:31:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is now everyday I am witnessing this. So here s what I m going to do now. This time I m going to film your staff doing it. I ll film them for one week  add that waste up  and contact you before making it public. We ve people starving all over the planet. You either learn to cook what you sell based on takings  or cook as and when. Furthermore any food that is cooked from fresh  mostly pre-cooked food has hourly shelf life date. 2-4 hours. Violating food safety laws  placing the public at risk of food pathogens  and slapping hungry people in the face at the same time. 2 1/ bags of waste guys  come on  every day?  I m not a happy Lion!					2016-07-11T20:27:49+0000	1468268869	2016-07-11 22:27:49	6	12	6	2	20	11	4	7	6	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was doing my online shop and was delighted to spot these as a treat for my allergy daughter. Sadly I then scrolled to the ingredients to find them blank. With a child with allergies  (she can t have Soya either)  it s great to find products that are similar to what her brother has  so I m sorely disappointed with the lack of labelling in your online store (made even worse by the fact this is a Free From product). Please look into this for us label-reading Mums and Dads!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13620755_10154370872949459_9034571898588494225_n.jpg?oh=36987dfbf6a4f63abc754c97cd59ca83&oe=591DC1CA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13620755_10154370872949459_9034571898588494225_n.jpg?oh=7a4e9961c361378855a41774cb0d6c9c&oe=591D55C7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154370872949459&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-11T20:01:59+0000	1468267319	2016-07-11 22:01:59	4	8	4	0	12	7	2	5	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was facing a (very scary) skip covered in flappy tarpaulin with a very spooky horse this afternoon and your driver was both very patient and polite  both whilst passing and unloading! It s so nice to know that people out there still care for horse riders  and I often see your vans driving through the village and they always take care to pass wide and slow! It is always appreciated! :)					2016-07-11T19:42:32+0000	1468266152	2016-07-11 21:42:32	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Being disabled and with no transport I use no bottled milk and only have dried. The Everyday Value one cost only £1.15 for 454g. Now I have to buy the 340g tub at £2.06! That is a huge increase in price for less milk!! Also the smaller amount means I could run out before my next order and there is none in my remote village! If you cannot stock both products please have just the Everyday Value one!! That was a great product and I relied on it!!					2016-07-11T19:30:20+0000	1468265420	2016-07-11 21:30:20	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I attempting to return a tin of paint with a recipt. I was told that if I did want to return the paint today they would only give me £6 for it as the number 1 on the recipient had become faded. Said paint is still £16 in store but it was bought from Risca tesco not Newport. They have refused to refund me without  a reprint of the recipt. I felt under suspicion and like I was doing something wrong by trying to return an unwanted purchase. I will not be buying home improvements from tesco again for fear of needing to return them and enduring the same treatment.					2016-07-11T18:39:16+0000	1468262356	2016-07-11 20:39:16	3	4	3	0	7	4	3	1	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly I put in a complaint about their fresh fish. Was supposed to be boneless but was FULL of bones. Next time I buy Frozen Ribs. They were dated February 2016 and this was JULY 2016. Opened their packed fresh large flat mushrooms to be met by a slug. Lastly overcharged on one of the 2 meal deals I bought. I am fed up having to go back.

I decided to wash it  as it had features as I did the skin started to peel of without me forcing it .. after which green balloon shaped things were attached.. I then opened the chicken to see the whole chicken was a lime green colour.. I had to remove this from my house as I physically felt sick  my hands still smell of a weird off smell.

It states that free click and collect is available for your bill if it is £30 or more. My bill came to £30.50 which means I am entitled to free click and collect. However at checkout Tesco have decided to tell me (after a very long process) that only some of my items can be delivered to store-the others must come to my house. Both being 3 miles from each other. So now you have charged me £3 delivery to my house for some items and £2 for store pick up for the rest. You have charged me twice. I am unhappy about this process and would like to discuss this with someone. Very poor.					2016-07-11T16:04:14+0000	1468253054	2016-07-11 18:04:14	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have the email trail to prove I cancelled it before the automatic renewal  and your insurance department agreed it was an error on their part. I have spent a total of 35 minutes on the phone from America  (where I now live) to your insurance company  due to not being called back as the first person I spoke to promised! I also will now have a mark on my credit history  and I hope to buy a property in the next 6 months. I would like to know how you can satisfy me that the credit hit I have taken due to your insurance company mistake has been remedied  and why I should be out of pocket for having to call you twice from America  for a mistake that your company made?					2016-07-11T15:26:52+0000	1468250812	2016-07-11 17:26:52	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only did you have to change the card details after I cancelled my lost card and forgot to tell you! (sorry to whoever the lady was I was trying to talk to....but you get extra points for understanding me!)  But then managed to change the delivery slot for him at really short notice (sorry I hadn t told him!) If we were not being enough of a pain you then also went way beyond and the girls from the office gave the driver flowers and wine for us. That s such a lovely surprise and so kind. Thank you.

I was cooking some organic spinach for my 23 month old daughter. Whilst stirring it I discovered a still live maggot hanging out in the pan. Looking through the spinach I found a few more  and I m sad to say that some had expired : ( Needless to say I made the decision to throw the spinach away as my daughter can be quite fussy with grubs and larvae. Unfortunately  the pack had been opened earlier in the day  and both my wife and myself had consumed a few handfuls each. Luckily neither of us are vegetarians  but I can t quite shake the thought that I am currently digesting a few bluebottle young.					2016-07-11T13:40:31+0000	1468244431	2016-07-11 15:40:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She s just put it on and one of the bows has come off. Checked it  along with the one that is still attached and it s only been fixed on with a single stitch.  Not driving all the way back to return it  and there was only one in this size anyway  so will be fixing it back on myself. Plus my daughter needed it for this afternoon so there s no time to sort a return anyway.   Making you aware that there is a problem with the fixings on the bottom part of the item. I expect a reply about the shoddy workmanship on this item as it wasn t exactly cheap and I didn t expect to need to mend it before it s even been used. Thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13600260_10156912621560538_8050844694947711420_n.jpg?oh=9d0491055c9ee5ce0b16271e40a2322c&oe=58DF48B8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13600260_10156912621560538_8050844694947711420_n.jpg?oh=c78c7686b91dc7ee3c670b1e17ca794c&oe=58D966B5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156912621560538&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-11T13:37:47+0000	1468244267	2016-07-11 15:37:47	3	2	3	0	5	2	1	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t want batons next to cleaning products that could potentially contaminate my fresh food. Told by some  company policy   others that it  shouldn t happen.  What do other customers think?

I still want to voice my opinion regarding a mobile phone contract I have with yourselves.  I have had a contact for 2 years and no issues so I upgraded.  The upgrade arrived the 19th of may 2016. A few days ago that phone started to fault. Upon researching it is and is and a common fault with a certain batch of the phones. I rang to explain this and nothing would be done until I had factory reset the phone. The only options I was given if this didn t work was to send the phone back to the manufacturer which would take a minimum of 2 weeks and this was justified stating I would be reimbursed the contract monies paid for the time the phone isn t in use. By the consumer rights act it is your job to make sure the phone I have purchased from yourselves to be fit for purpose. I have looked on the citizens advice website and I am indeed eligible to request an exchange. I phone again to express my feelings and hopefully mobe forward and I am not given a direct answer except blame to the manufacturer who are apparently the only people who can sort my problem-  only when I mention the CAB do I get anywhere. I am then offered a refurbished phone which will only be sent when the current phone is received back. Fair enough  however I again will be approx 2 weeks without a phone.  This is my only communication device- no landline or anything so if my 2 small children need the doctors or anything during this 2 weeks i cannot call them to get them an appointment  if worse happens I can t even ring 999.  I explained this in the previous phone call and was asked if I  could borrow one from a family member- again no use as I can t and even if I could my sim isn t compatible.  The bag will take 3-5 working days by post which I have to bare with it being faulty.  If I post it immediately who knows when it will arrive  then there is the processing time plus another 3-5 working days for the refurbished phone to arrive.  So not even 2 months in to my contract  only 1 bill paid for the remaining 22 months I will be paying a certain amount in full (as per your broken down bill) for a refurbished phone- not what I signed up for!  As I have said to the customer service representative on the phone  if this were a microwave - no matter the manufacturer  if it were still in warranty I could take it back to your store it would be replaced with another or a microwave of equal value  no quibbles.  Overall  very unhappy regarding the outcome and inconvenience this was cause and it being justified with you at some later stage reimbursing me monies  for the inconvenience.					2016-07-11T11:09:39+0000	1468235379	2016-07-11 13:09:39	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just been in to get a bit of shopping and to purchase 2 of your Amazon Fire TV Sticks at your electrical counter for my living room and bedroom at home. The young lady  Jess  serving me was great and was serving me with a professional attitude. She was going through your returns policy with me when another lady  I assume in her late 50s early 60s with short dark greyish hair interrupted her and said word for word  Don t worry Jess  those fire sticks are not coming back because people like that put programs on and sell them . I was in a bit of shock at how rude and unprofessional she was and labeling me as  people like that . What are  people like that  exactly? and why am I being labelled? And why would I sell them when anyone can get them?  Well you have now lost a valued customer as will be doing my shopping in Asda in future. You really need to teach your staff about customer service and to keep any opinions about customers to them selves. It is downright unprofessional and extremely rude.					2016-07-11T10:51:52+0000	1468234312	2016-07-11 12:51:52	0	2	0	1	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Appaling service. Poor response from customer service and 10 day wait for refund of my shopping.  I Emailed Tesco to check if they deliver to first floor and they respond on a saturday evening within 1hr  confirming their drivers will deliver to first floor  and give me a £10 voucher off my next shop because they are appalled at the treatment I got from another retailer!   #letdownbyasda but #tescodoitbetter.    Disabilities are no fun  respect and fair treatment should be given as standard.  Tesco customer service response was fast and professional.  I was so impressed with the response on a Saturday evening from Kate Gough.  I will be using Tesco for my online shopping from now on.

Not usually one to complain but the amount of rubbish your tesco express in Teignmouth makes is appalling!! Absolutely sick and tired of the unsightly view I have every morning from my house! I frequently use your cashpoint and am met with rubbish  plastic and cardboard that have fallen from your delivery metal crates! The sad thing is a local group are picking up your rubbish for you for nothing! I refuse to join  clean up the avenues  as it is your shop that is causing this!  Something needs to be done  I will continue to post photos until you add more bins/talk to your staff or I see some action being taken. We live in a beautiful seaside town and you are just ruining it! We visit Waitrose up the road and are not met with the same state so you must be getting something wrong! Very very angry customer here!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13626469_10157069473440364_1335425124240914826_n.jpg?oh=d284a0ab05d7750a5e77fde64567feb6&oe=59180E18	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13626469_10157069473440364_1335425124240914826_n.jpg?oh=e8a2bcfc966460b105ae13494525afb8&oe=58D86015	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157069473440364&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-11T07:58:02+0000	1468223882	2016-07-11 09:58:02	10	7	10	0	17	6	5	1	2	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

Front to back of pack.   Wouldn t mind but our lad has a bladder condition and needs them at school but we now have none so had to take the morning off to sort this out. I tried to take back to our local tesco express as everywhere else was shut but they refused to take back as I got to take it back to the larger store which was closed and they had no pull ups at all.   As I said normally I m not fussy at all but this did strike a nerve a little bit.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13627038_10157080296570696_5826053676586465091_n.jpg?oh=0139b909194b2766a50dd619bc26e2e5&oe=58EF9BEA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13627038_10157080296570696_5826053676586465091_n.jpg?oh=17d670f28d2378344c5d2fb5f08317a9&oe=58E839E7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157080296570696&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-11T07:30:10+0000	1468222210	2016-07-11 09:30:10	1	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

At the time I also purchased the 2 year insurance cover and was told that this covered my tablet for 2 years.  Since then my son unfortunately dropped his tablet and the screen cracked. We sent it off via square trade and the screen was replaced. At no point was it ever made clear to me this is where my cover ended. When I purchased with hudl no one told me if you get it repaired before your 2 years is up then the cover finishes and I m not covered.  So yesterday I rang square trade again as my hudl screen has again cracked  to be told that my repair last time exceeded my limit and I wasn t insured. If I was made aware of this after my last repair I would have insured my sons hudl as he is only 5 and accidents happen.  So how do you suggest you rectify this lack of customer service?

The 1st tub only had 280ml in it   and the 2nd tub only had 285ml in it ?? when it clearly states on the side of the tub 300ml ?? i had to nip out at 10pm to our local shop to purchase some more as the tubs were short ! Is this normal practice to underfill the tubs   in my case BOTH of them ? my recipe called for 600ml exactly   A bit annoying when i assumed 300ml in both would be exactly what i required . My scales were correct as all my other ingredients were correct . I am so cross   as if this is the case in every tub   then you are deceiving the public ?? 300 should mean 300 NOT 280 or 285 ! a very annoyed customer !!					2016-07-10T22:16:36+0000	1468188996	2016-07-11 00:16:36	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They had one member of staff who had to lock up the Click and Collect unit and walk over to the store for each customer and then bring back the items that were chilled. This caused us and the other customers more problems waiting around and then deciding what we would risk taking or exchanging. We had ordered through Click and Collect to save time  so to wait around for over 10 minutes was not the greatest idea. Why couldn t they send another member of staff over to do this?   The problem was made worse by the derogatory response from the Customer Engagement Centre ! After a few emails sending back and forth  it appears that Tesco really don t value our custom enough for me to bother trying to reason with them. Maybe I should start driving past the entrance to my local Tesco that I have been visiting for over 20 years  to get better service somewhere else.   Every little helps....and it is very little and it doesn t help!					2016-07-10T19:17:13+0000	1468178233	2016-07-10 21:17:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got 2 at Christmas for my girls and they finally told me why they hate bike riding...they can not pull the brakes. In fact they can barely reach the brakes. I took them to a bike shop and they said there is nothing they can do they are just cheap bikes. They were over £100 each so I wouldn t call them cheap. It was the frozen forever sisters bike and the pink barbie bike.					2016-07-10T17:26:22+0000	1468171582	2016-07-10 19:26:22	1	11	1	0	12	11	3	8	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

What is the difference between two products? They both seem to be pecan nuts  both seem to have the same nutritional values  and both seem to weigh 100 crammed. The only difference I can see is that one is stocked in the baking section and one is stocked in the whole foods section. This appears to warrant two seperate prices  one is €1.65 and the other is €3.59(over 100% of a price difference). I hope there is a reason for this extraordinary difference. I have looked at the nutritional values and they are almost exactly the same. I look forward to your considered response on this matter   Derek	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13668960_10157254327045151_4333666879762692136_n.jpg?oh=efa63835b8eb7a8acbc5ddd048290049&oe=58E3BA2D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13668960_10157254327045151_4333666879762692136_n.jpg?oh=dceda0263fc45b155b1d3c7048880aaf&oe=58EDDF20	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157254327045151&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-10T16:35:34+0000	1468168534	2016-07-10 18:35:34	15	5	16	0	21	5	5	0	4	0	15	1	0	0	0	0	0

Secondly I m disappointed with the customer service which I received by one of your members of staff  all the items I picked were what have been for the meal deal and when I asked I got a very stroppy answer telling me you re not doing the meals deals today and after placing one of my items on the self check out packing area the machine didn t register it was on there so I picked it up and put it down a couple of times where again the staff member proceeded to be stroppy again with me telling me to put it down so she could sort it out  completely unacceptable behaviour!!					2016-07-10T16:14:22+0000	1468167262	2016-07-10 18:14:22	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now this isn t the first time I have had issues with these apples  they normally come buried but this is unbelievable 🙈	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13600332_829334237196459_6095411766366875355_n.jpg?oh=4da2110c8f2b463b48fca57b488b147f&oe=58D99959	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13600332_829334237196459_6095411766366875355_n.jpg?oh=c45a3d8230db1e0c2f92db1f33bfdae8&oe=58DC9DA6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=829334237196459&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-10T15:31:33+0000	1468164693	2016-07-10 17:31:33	0	7	0	0	7	7	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wanted to express my complete dissatisfaction with your letter of response following my return of 2 bags of pest infected pasta  purchased at a Dundee store. While your apology was appreciated  there was no explanation or reason given for the beasties I found in the sealed bag of pasta  and no promise to get back in touch to let me know the outcomes of any investigation.  The ladies I spoke to when I returned the products were visibly disgusted by the state of my pasta  and genuinely horrified - I cannot fault their service and attempts to resolve the complaint  but I asked them to mark the complaint as  not resolved in store  as I thought I would get a more thorough response from you  but sadly your letter gives no more information on the cause of this issue than they could.  The £10.00 gift card with your letter was also an interesting gesture  especially since it wasn t even accompanied by a refund for the dodgy pasta. I ve had more compensation for a screwed up online groceries order and would have thought that were less of an issue for your company than contaminated food products? So  thanks for your letter  but you can be assured that it has in NO WAY reassured me that pasta products bought in your stores are safe to consume.

This was in recognition of all the great work the volunteers do each week during term time to support children/young adults with a range of disabilities/special needs. The volunteers were presented with their gifts on Friday evening & here are some of them with some of the swimmers.  All the volunteers were completely overwhelmed & have asked for their thanks to be passed onto Alison & Tesco. As a parent of a child with a learning disability it is fantastic to see Tesco supporting & recognising local unpaid volunteers #tesco #community #communitychampion #recognition #volunteers #volunteering #learningdisabilities #specialneeds #givinguptime #donations #ThankYou #swimming	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13620338_10201775006532391_7645161158656304052_n.jpg?oh=a83449e87f0103f735d840a8b31f652e&oe=59220A44	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/13580535_10201775006532391_7645161158656304052_o.jpg?oh=b40b596ae114aff3b9fe1b4a99658b0c&oe=58DEE6B3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201775006532391&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-10T14:47:44+0000	1468162064	2016-07-10 16:47:44	19	3	19	2	24	3	2	1	3	0	19	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have done this for years and have always been happy with the products until today. Today I bought 4 bags of chicken wings from the pre cooked counter for ill family members back home that are unable to cook for themselves. When we travelled 15 miles back home  we realised the chicken out of one bags was raw. We then opened all the bags and cut into every single chicken piece to find out not only were they raw  blood was coming from them. My household consists of older generations and a toddler who could have easily got hold of these and got major food poisoning!!! To say I am disappointed is an understatement. This could have resulted in a visit to Raigmore which I am glad we avoided. I then went on the Tesco online chat to complain to be told to take them back to the shop next time I am in Dingwall(which won t be until next Sunday)!!!! Disgusting.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13615496_10209227337981152_2815216031150465312_n.jpg?oh=9792e4562c9ab99c4aa0f90994f4909e&oe=58E7EA9F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13615496_10209227337981152_2815216031150465312_n.jpg?oh=8bd63ee3fb5cc6bf7d7d21421b785b2e&oe=58EC0F92	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209227337981152&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-10T14:09:23+0000	1468159763	2016-07-10 16:09:23	53	54	86	57	197	51	37	14	104	0	52	0	14	0	0	19	0

Usually they ll start to go mouldy within a few days  but this is a new record. Bought today  Best Before six days hence  but with mouldy veg already.   There s providing cheaper produce using conventional measures  and then there s cutting costs by not having decent quality control...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13501886_10154528726703643_6204325871625304495_n.jpg?oh=a4506abe0a2f25377f392a1c529fa9c3&oe=591ED549	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13501886_10154528726703643_6204325871625304495_n.jpg?oh=9753731b2fa79149211a8d563ccdf503&oe=58D8A844	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154528726703643&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-10T13:02:41+0000	1468155761	2016-07-10 15:02:41	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

I called on Thursday to see if you had a certain medication in stock for my (really quite unwell) 9 week old son. I was told it wasn t in stock but could be ordered and would be in store in a couple of days. The staff member took my son s details  along with my contact number  and said somebody would call me when the meds had arrived.  I called today to check if it was there yet  as it had been 3 days  and the staff member that I spoke to advised she could see no record of the medication ever being ordered  and said that she could order it for us tomorrow.  The fact that the staff member I spoke to on Thursday simply didn t bother to put the order in is unacceptable. From the details that she took she could see how young my son is  and surely by the fact that the medication needed to be ordered in specially  she could see that he s very unwell.   Unfortunately  I didn t get the staff member s name on Thursday. However  I assume your calls are recorded  so I m happy to give you details of the time/date etc of my call in order for you to look into this.					2016-07-10T12:24:40+0000	1468153480	2016-07-10 14:24:40	2	18	6	0	24	17	8	9	12	0	2	0	1	0	0	3	0

For the last 2 weeks Seriously Strong Cheddar has been half price so we d ordered double. However  Tesco only supplied half of what we ordered. Two times over 2 weeks.  So we thought we d see  now that the offer is over  if we were to order double whether they would send it  and surprise surprise  they did.  This is a really poor business practice  and an unfair exploitation of the distance selling relationship you have. Additionally  it s tempted me to cancel the delivery saver and go with WAITROSE or SAINSBURYS  as they wouldn t pull this nonsense.

I appreciate that most considerate people wouldn t do this  but the fact that some people do means that I can t risk it. I personally would be happy to pay a few pence more to purchase individually wrapped rolls  or some other method which meant people couldn t handle produce they didn t then purchase.

You need to support healthy foods and open days etc and advertise more healthy foods on your adverts and also cut down on things like bacon butty and cake days that you hold for cancer  you are actually giving them cancer!

Everytime you go in there you can hardly get around as it seems your staff are constantly pushing those huge trollies all over the store re-stocking shelves. It s in the mornings  afternoons and at night. Doesn t matter when you go in  it s always like that. Could the staff not fully stock the shelves every morning so that for the rest of the day your customers can actually walk around the store without having to squeeze through every aisle?  Also  there are never enough staff on the tills and you have to wait ages to pay for your shopping because theres always only one poor person on the till as all the others are pushing their trollies stocking shelves!!					2016-07-09T21:43:38+0000	1468100618	2016-07-09 23:43:38	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco   if you look at the button that says draw... when I was at school this should be spelt as Drawer. To draw is to create an image onto paper or other medium. In this instance the word should mean Drawer in the true sense of it actually being a Drawer!!!

I have just done a mad dash to the local  little  tesco in holland on Sea  to buy my daughter 30 packs off euro football stickers   to hopefully complete the album  when she wakes up and before the final tomorrow evening (we all know the stickers and a half filled album are redundant after this) to get home and find I only have 29!!!!!!! Now in the grand scheme off things  this isn t too important but to a 6 year old (and a geeky dad) this could be the difference in a full book or 6 short so all I ask is for the till operators to count and recount the packs.

I just dashed in with my two year old and six year old on the way back from a trip  and despite it being an hour to closing time  they couldn t have been more helpful. I had fully expected to do it all myself but they saw me struggling with the trolley and a sleepy two year old and stepped in even though they probably had a million other things to do.   John was absolutely brilliant  he helped us round the store to find a cereal I was looking for  Jude checked stock to see if they had it and offered to try and get it stocked in store  and John and Jack between them unloaded and bagged up our shopping.   John kept saying it was what they were there for but I think that s the point  most people don t look at it like that and most supermarket staff would have left us to it. I m really grateful to them all  they really brightened my day and I d like to thank them publicly for making a frazzled mum feel a little less frazzled. You re all brilliant.					2016-07-09T20:41:11+0000	1468096871	2016-07-09 22:41:11	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

She arrived in plenty of time to get her mobility scooter out. However on crossing the road it stopped working. She was sat there for a while until thankfully a nice customer came to her rescue who couldn t work out what was wrong with the scooter so ran into the store to ask for a one of the stores scooters. Someone came out and said they couldn t bring it out because it would sound the alarm and left her there. She had to call me in a panic to go and help her. I get there 15 mins later to find the customer on his hands and knees still trying to sort her scooter out. Someone else came along and offered to push her back to her car which she accepted. So disgusted that staff knew she was stuck outside and didn t offer to help at all. Needless to say she missed her much needed appointment. Customer service in that store is shocking. Just glad of the two guys that helped her out!					2016-07-09T20:11:34+0000	1468095094	2016-07-09 22:11:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

(NOT)  I asked for the price of an item but he was too busy nattering that he couldn t do it. He told me to go to customer service on the other side of the store to find out so I left the toy with him and left the clothes I was going to buy too and didn t continue with the rest of my shopping.

Shockingly terrible in so many ways Tesco. Just wow. I m not sure that if Dave had have spat on it in front of me it would bother him as I would have to cook it anyway! Said Bacteria would then be killed. With an open heart can you tell me that Dave doesn t have the same affliction as Joachim Lowe (Germany s manager). Did Dave handle my meat with his bacteria bum sweat hands??? I won t be eating Dave s armpit fish meat and I can t believe this is the type of training you provide to your staff.					2016-07-09T19:58:48+0000	1468094328	2016-07-09 21:58:48	12	19	18	2	39	19	17	2	14	0	12	1	2	1	0	0	0

I m sitting at your cafe in Bedford and ordered an item  which was handled without gloves  then the server jumped onto the till  then went on to scratch his head and preceded to continue serving food  he did all this WITHOUT washing his hands or gloves. I spotted other employees touching door handles and not washing their hands either.  Spoke to a team leader who confirmed it is not your policy.

On unpacking the shopping I realised we had a crate of shopping missing..so I rang him (he had rang me before arrival as was a little early) and was back again within a few minutes still happy and cheery and apologising evan though it was our fault as he was distracted lol! A little goes a long way..thank you 😃					2016-07-09T18:46:42+0000	1468090002	2016-07-09 20:46:42	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

People need to be stopped doing this for one its dangerous if you are using the path and a taxi suddenly cuts you off  and its not fair on disabled people who need to park yet cant because of the idiots with no respect. also the abuse of mother and baby parking spots seriously do they need to have such little distance to walk with their beer with no badge or no child  excuse my drawing just highlighting where the disabled spots are the black dots are the bollards the taxis drive through.. oh and the zebras i put on there too lol .... PLEASE PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO STOP THIS ABUSE i mean seriously i will sit there for a day and take pictures if i have too	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13626336_10210021235987932_1610548392156158872_n.jpg?oh=0725d8a828b7b31c2859e89369e84bc9&oe=58EB2C25	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13626336_10210021235987932_1610548392156158872_n.jpg?oh=fab91fe683632b37e145a1d7d4075c10&oe=59180128	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210021235987932&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-09T18:39:51+0000	1468089591	2016-07-09 20:39:51	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tonight he has friends here for a sleepover as a treat and he chose to have chicken gougons in warm baguettes for dinner. After a fabulous afternoon playing football and computing  we have just served the boys their food. All was well  until my son started coughing  saying something was stuck in his throat. Then he coughed up this. A 2cm piece of sharp green plastic that had come out of his chicken gougon! Please explain what this could possibly be...? Obviously this has somewhat spoilt an otherwise lovely occasion. I m just thankful he didn t swallow it!! 😕 Thank you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13600283_10157210500685473_5093642989245452204_n.jpg?oh=cdb0779de1d3bbda9af727c35bb3058a&oe=59220C0F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13600283_10157210500685473_5093642989245452204_n.jpg?oh=75542744817597408b62d7a3fbc42afe&oe=58D74102	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157210500685473&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-09T17:20:04+0000	1468084804	2016-07-09 19:20:04	0	41	19	0	60	39	17	22	36	0	0	0	10	0	0	9	0

Some are getting money off coupons and some are getting extra points coupons but some unlucky ones who spend well over a hundred pound a week instores get nothing at all. If this is part of your new schemes since taking the boost away it s not fair as it doesn t benefit all your customers just a select few.					2016-07-09T14:54:25+0000	1468076065	2016-07-09 16:54:25	2	8	2	0	10	8	3	5	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

You have clearly identified this as the growing market that it is  and you are addressing this demand. However you are also risking loosing customers from this growth market with your latest suggestion that buying dairy milk somehow improves the lives of dairy cows. This is not true; the only thing that would improve the lives of dairy cows is to stop the endless cruel cycle that every one of these creatures has to endue  against their wills  to provide milk for human consumption. Your policy of paying dairy farmers a fair amount is good but this will only go to improving profits for the farmer not improving the lives of the cows.					2016-07-09T14:03:56+0000	1468073036	2016-07-09 16:03:56	2	0	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

I want to thank again this wonderful lady who gave such a lovely  simple but amazing act of kindness to me today that I was reduced to tears in the store car park!  I have 2.5 yr old twin boys who absolutely refuse to get into twin trolley seats so they walk with me. Normally they re very good  but this afternoon  as soon as we got into the store (I was on my own with them)  they both descended into the most almighty melt-down. One was running one way  the other was running another way  whilst I was trying to push a trolley.  She approached & asked if there was anything else I needed. She went to get that for me whilst I tried to scoop my screaming children from the floor. She then got another member of staff to open a till straight away so I could pay & leave to see to my boys. She packed my shopping for me  whilst trying to talk to & help calm my boys the whole time. She managed it with one of them. She then pushed my trolley to my car whilst chatting away nicely & holding the hand of my one calm child  leaving me free to try to control my other one. Once at my car she loaded my shopping into my boot whilst I got my boys into their car seats. Once they were safe  I thanked her for being such a star.  She said it was no problem  & that we had all been there. I told her I felt like I wanted to hug her & she said  Oh come on then ....& so she hugged me...& I was in tears in Tesco car park  struck & overcome with the relief of the situation & the kindness of this person.  For anyone who is a mum of multiples  this will undoubtedly strike a chord  but I m sure it would with most people too.  In many ways  it wasn t much that she did  but in so many others  it was so very much more than most would do.   This lovely lady  & those like her need to know that what seems a simple & straight forward act of kindness  can not just make someone s day that day  but it can make their weeks & months better  because we don t forget that there are people like this.  And to anyone who has ever seen someone struggle like I was today  & who have felt embarrassed or unsure of how to help; do it anyway. It will be hugely appreciated & restores faith in humankind.  Thank you so much to Sharon. She deserves good things. Please share this post far & wide so she has a chance of seeing it. Thank you all x 					2016-07-09T11:36:43+0000	1468064203	2016-07-09 13:36:43	5	2	5	0	7	2	1	1	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Look  I know you sell milk. People want milk. Supply and demand  I get that. You re probably always going to sell milk. But the campaign you re using is based on lies. Milk does NOT help dairy cows. It ensures that calves are taken away from their mothers prematurely and requires repeated artificial insemination. Buying milk helps farmers  sure  but absolutely not the cows!  The vegan community are PLEADING with you  if you must sell milk  PLEASE don t use harmful lies to do so. Come on Tesco  I used to work for you and I know you re better than this! Please listen to your customers!					2016-07-09T11:01:21+0000	1468062081	2016-07-09 13:01:21	9	2	10	0	12	2	2	0	7	0	8	0	0	1	0	0	0

(I reckon as pensioners they think we must be made of money) because they couldn t cancel the other TV because it was with the carriers.

The carton on the left is what I always buy - the carton on the right is identical but a far more practical shape ... Identical ingredients etc etc etc BUT on the  new shape  for some reason it states in blue KEEP REFRIGERATED and when my shopping arrived these cartons were cold so had obviously come out of a fridge. WHY??? The original one is refrigerate after opening - surely if the contents are IDENTICAL then the storage instructions should be too????

I bought two boxes of pouches which my cat is normally fine with but for some reason eating from one of the boxes keeps making her sick? I thought she might of just been having a bad day but then tried the other box and she was fine she ate all that then tried again with the other batch and straight away she was sick again.					2016-07-09T06:27:40+0000	1468045660	2016-07-09 08:27:40	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of your staff was bagging up bread rolls  cakes and muffins. When I asked him where these were going he told me that they would be sent to a pig farm as they could only be kept for a day. What can t Tesco give these to a Soup kitchen or charity for the homeless to make use out of it? There was nothing wrong with the produce and it was still very edible. Such a shame that during times of austerity Tesco is still not doing enough to stop food waste.					2016-07-09T00:01:47+0000	1468022507	2016-07-09 02:01:47	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

So here in all it s glory is the fruit that you sent me in my delivery on the 5th - it s very clearly covered in fungus and perfectly apparent to see.  No  the plums haven t rotated in transit in the packaging and maybe the fungus was hidden.  The splodge beneath the packaging top right is another plum in the same condition.  This should never have been picked by your staff at Tesco Wombwell.  It sounds like I m throwing a hissy fit about nothing  doesn t it?  Just a pack of plums after all!  But it s every time I order  there s always a problem.  I haven t used your delivery service for 18 months now until three days ago and it hasn t improved.  I ve learned my lesson  you ve persuaded me never to use it again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13612303_10206464320228505_3968408516504632570_n.jpg?oh=5cd481225435a7f5c9f5f219f1627a06&oe=58E42B99	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q82/s720x720/13612303_10206464320228505_3968408516504632570_n.jpg?oh=c19b16755fce04ea2a8de6f7077533f2&oe=58DE6708	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206464320228505&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-08T22:20:25+0000	1468016425	2016-07-09 00:20:25	4	9	4	0	13	9	4	5	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was meeting some old friends for a meal and then having a movie evening in. A standard Friday night for a poor student in a town with little to no night life. On our way to the movie evening we stopped off at our local Tesco (Sidwell street - Exeter). Again  a standard night.  As I and my three friends left the store one of your security guards came to say goodbye. A nice gesture - yes but he didn t actually say goodbye. He came up to me and said  Having a good evening Serena Williams  I saw you on the court today at Wimbledon?   I feel I should pause here and let you know a fact about me. I m black (well  mixed race) and my friends are white (not a big deal - but important context). Racism is never something I ve really come across - it s something I ve always seen as its shown in movies  people being told that they can t go somewhere or do something because of the colour of their skin BUT that s not the only kind. It s casual everyday racism  like the throwaway comment I ve mentioned above which is the most prevalent in society.  Comments and comparisons to famous people  yeah that s nice and all. I m sure many would say it s a compliment but  and here s another fact about me Tesco  I m nothing like Serena Williams.  She s athletic and sporty  my only form of exercise is walking to the fridge to get my latest ice lolly. She s 34  I m 21. Let s be honest the only comparison is that we re both black. If you want to see and make your own further comparisons I m more than happy to send you a photo of me so that you can draw your own conclusions.  In all seriousness though Tesco  and I know it s been a fairly jokey message so far. Whilst the security guard might have meant it as a joke (and I m almost sure that he did) it s these throwaway comments which contribute to the everyday racism which people encounter. I m not someone to complain about this kind of thing Tesco but I thought it was something I should bring it to your attention. Whilst offence was certainly not intended I feel the above is a point which could be mentioned to your staff.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.

I visited tonight at 10 pm with a friend for him to be called pathetic by a lady working in the store  she was wearing a F&F uniform  when I asked for her name as i wanted to speak to a manager she refused to give it to me and said fine Ill go and get a manager! She was one of the rudest people I have ever dealt with. When she found a manager and spoke to him he listened to our side of the story and said that the lady would be dealt with  however I don t think this was the case as she walked away smirking! Now im not saying my friend wasn t in the wrong  he ran up the travellator. (However He does have ADHD) I don t think this calls for him to be called pathetic! I would like for this to be taken further as I don t believe it will be dealt with in store					2016-07-08T21:50:12+0000	1468014612	2016-07-08 23:50:12	2	5	2	0	7	5	5	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A year later  it still fails to be a convenient meal for a Friday night (almost every part of it has to be put in to the oven at 3 - 5 minute intervals)  it is still totally bland  taste-wise  and the spring rolls are still so small that they don t come under the heading of  normal spring roll size  fun-size spring roll size  mini-spring size  and just end up as  what the hell is that spring roll  size. Don t waste your money  people  make your own. It will take less time and taste better.					2016-07-08T21:04:01+0000	1468011841	2016-07-08 23:04:01	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I went to the Wisbech store and bought a variety of items including a box of fruit & fibre  for the legoland tickets and because I really wanted some.   This eve I thought I would check for the codes of the adult goes free to find it telling me to use by 30th June 2016... Puzzled as the website previously said 2017 I then check the use by date -  To my disgust to find its months out of date from off the shelf.   I have recently switched from Asda - and never once received such products. I have even now gone through all my other items I have brought in sheer paranoia.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13606891_10210458844686483_2769554709621225530_n.jpg?oh=094acc7b21ec47bafd1236a053bc4d84&oe=591D751F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13606891_10210458844686483_2769554709621225530_n.jpg?oh=ad5dbb5b9d64466d92b50175a78d3d7f&oe=59192B12	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210458844686483&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-08T20:59:44+0000	1468011584	2016-07-08 22:59:44	1	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0

It was advertised at £30  so I thought I would pick it up. I was very disappointed when I got in my car and noticed that I had been charged £46 for it. I took the item to your customer service desk- who confirmed that the shelf edge label was infact wrong and offered the difference back. I enquired that mistakes are meant to be double the difference  but was told that you no longer do this. Rather than hold up the queue I decided to trust this information and receive the £16 back. I have since gone online to check this information on your website  which confirms that you do offer double the difference for overcharges! I am extremely annoyed that I have been lied to by your member of staff. I hope others have not been mislead like this- it is extremely unfair and unprofessional for a company of your size.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13626471_10153586700655025_7477285736801073384_n.jpg?oh=fe61dadfc023f7503a71844eec288779&oe=58E30622	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13626471_10153586700655025_7477285736801073384_n.jpg?oh=7c410711dc82759c465c5e7e5c7dc62c&oe=5923122F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153586700655025&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-08T20:07:12+0000	1468008432	2016-07-08 22:07:12	3	12	3	0	15	12	4	8	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked him why and he said that they weren t allowed to give them away. There can be no excuse for wasting perfectly good food  particularly in times of austerity when more and more people have to rely on food banks. I note that recently France has made it illegal for supermarkets to throw away food. It would send a strong positive message if Tesco decided that they were going to take a stand against food waste.					2016-07-08T19:51:55+0000	1468007515	2016-07-08 21:51:55	2	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to make my issues known to the person who delivered my shopping today.  He s 6ft 6  and hoyed those green boxes around like they were feathers.  Unless you find out who this man is and send him straight around to my house to address the issue  I will be very very sad.  Thanking you in anticipation of a hasty reply.  That is all.  P.S.

There is clearly a huge need for some further training for your staff in PR.   I hope very much that you are in the process of learning from what has been said and how you have approached the situation.  Veganism as I am sure you are aware  commercially if no other way is a growing ethical choice amongst consumers for many reasons; whatever an individual s circumstances and reasons  their choice saved a great deal of suffering and makes a positve environmental impact.  Can I please urge you to look at how you engage with us as vegans? Can I also ask that you consider how your marketing team works to enhance your sales  there is a disconnect and it needs some work.  I potentially would be happy to discuss further.   Thank you for your time.					2016-07-08T18:54:20+0000	1468004060	2016-07-08 20:54:20	18	3	22	0	25	3	2	1	7	0	17	3	0	1	0	0	0

Here s two of your Fresh Cream slices (slightly bashed) I purchased this evening.   Now  I m not one to moan (joke  I moan about everything  I m Mancunian...) anyways  I m not one to moan  but tonight I picked up these slices and to my right I spotted the reduced item guy.   You know  the guy who reduces things.  So I said:  Excuse me fine reducing man  good sir...  Or something like that...  Are these going to be reduced today?   No!  - he replied.   So I toddled off to the checkout and paid  in full  for my slices. £1.21.  Fine.  Except when I m coming out of the store I m informed by my partner that he s seen someone else with the same cakes reduced!   How can this be?  I went back in to check out the situation.   It was true.   £0.61p.   Tesco  I can t bear this. Your guy could have made my night. Given me some cakes and happiness on the cheap  but he swindled me.   I ll be sure to try and ignore the bitter taste of these fresh cream slices later.

In the last couple of months I ve felt very despondence with my local store in Sheringham NR26-   My daughter has been so bullied at secondary school to the point were she started cutting herself having full on panic attacks she became very withdrawn it wasn t an easy time.  As a family we decided to move schools which has changed her back to the child I know and love.  Her grades have gone from bottom sets to top sets within 6 months.   Myself and my daughter are very happy.   We shop at are local Tesco s very day for bits and bobs and a weekly shop on top of that too.    The group of young youths have started hanging around inside the    foray on a bench (group 8/12) at a time.  Every time there all together they Hackel myself and daughter which makes me feel intimidated and I can t explain how it makes my daughter feel.   I ask once for the group to be removed as I didn t feel safe leaving the store.  The security guard and girls behind the cigarette counter was brilliant but they called the cashier manager over so he could ask the youth to move on.  He was very dismissive over my fear but because the other staff could see my distress the security guard moved them on.   I then went in on a Sunday morning early to try a catch the cashier manager to have a chat about how the youths are hackling spitting calling us names and how I felt uncomfortable in distress when there hanging around!!!!!!  He was very dismissive told me I was the only person how felt threatened or upset by there presents.  He was walking away from me as I was trying to talk to him in circles wouldn t give me eye contact I felt he didn t care about a loyal customer.  He said   he wasn t willing to keep asking them to move as it was harassment against them!!!   I asked about them harassing myself and my daughter.  He told me   it was my problem and no one else had complained  I questioned this and he got angry with me and said he would call the local police.  Then walked away.  As you can imagine how upset I was and disgusted by the way the gentlemen had doubt with me.   I was at the self check out he came back over to me saying there not out there and my reply was I didn t say that!!!  I told him he was rude and wasn t a very good manager as I felt he should of taken me to a quiet spot in the store taken a statement from me and my telephone number he didn t like that to much.  I also told he after the was he had treated me I would never shop in Tescos again until the situation with the youths hanging around inside the store was doubt with..... Yes he walked away lol   I have found out tonight that he lied to me regarding any other complaints may people have done so with very similar fears of the antisocial behaviour.     I can t shop in my local Tesco s anymore because of the fear of being harassed by antisocial behaviour.    I believe the cashier manager let myself and my daughter down by not doing his job correctly.  I have written this with a heavy heart as over the years I ve enjoyed shopping at Tesco s but can t shop at my local store anymore...

I only ask as you re claiming that milking cows is in their interests. I don t believe suffering is a good thing  and that is exactly what results from the dairy industry.

A few days ago I went to purchase a gazebo priced at £129.99 (not on sale ) I couldn t remember my password so couldn t complete the purchase.  Today I went online to buy it and saw that the gazebo was now £50 off  bargain it will only be £79.99 now. How mistaken was I when I saw the price is now £149.99 reduced from £199.99.  The price is infact £20 more than it was before the sale!!! Tesco informed me that it is a company that sell through Tesco Direct and can set/amend prices as and when they want and Tesco take no responsibility for the blatant misleading price hike this sub company have added at the point of going on sale. I did get a sorry which obviously makes misleading the public acceptable.  Well done Tesco another customer service gold star.					2016-07-08T15:53:22+0000	1467993202	2016-07-08 17:53:22	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The food hamper which my grandmother received had out of date food!! Bakery goods only had one day shelf life left and the tinned items were reduced and so badly dented they were no use to her or any other pensioners!! I know she is not the only one who is not happy with what Tesco has donated!! she will not be taking another food hamper from the lunch club due to the quality of your donations!!					2016-07-08T15:13:46+0000	1467990826	2016-07-08 17:13:46	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	8	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only does the form ask for a lot of unnecessary personal details but also the address bit is not working so I couldn t continue. Firstly  unusually for Tesco  the store is one of those places playing stressful and unpleasant piped music. Secondly  I queued up with my 2 items but the checkout assistant sneezed on her hand so I had to go to one of those self-service tills. The assistant seemed somewhat surprised at my (polite) comment. I am currently suffering from yet another virus respiratory virus caused by this type of source with poor hand hygiene knowledge. It is about time you trained staff at all levels in basic hand hygiene. There is a similar problem with a couple of the staff at your Berwick on Tweed branch. I have brought up 3 issues here so would appreciate it if you would deal with them separately.					2016-07-08T15:03:14+0000	1467990194	2016-07-08 17:03:14	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I took the wrap from the box I was disgusted as the wrap has clearly been made to look like it has a sufficient amount of filling and however this was not the case! The filling stopped after two tiny pieces of chicken and the whole thing was basically just wrap!! How is that a lunch!?? I don t expect a giant gourmet serving as I know it s just a meal deal but the fact that it had been packed to purposely fool people into thinking it was filled is awful!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13620393_10154118999621187_5033578949619072081_n.jpg?oh=8a34057302cc2e484eb5aee982c77ee8&oe=58F02D7B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13620393_10154118999621187_5033578949619072081_n.jpg?oh=da9bb6462328dd73e9b888b52f6a4649&oe=5922F876	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154118999621187&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-08T13:06:57+0000	1467983217	2016-07-08 15:06:57	3	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	2	1	0	0	0

I have never got so stressed in my life. I Realise Fridays is a busy day but having to contest  with your food carts as well down every isle was a joke. I couldn t  even get down some isles as there was two blocking the route. I counted about twenty carts out if not more. Surely this is not the best time to start restocking shelves. It seriously needs to be scaled down. Every time I visit the store all the staff do is chat amongst themselves and not acknowledge the customers there is no eye contact at all. Seriously I am not one to complain but it s bad. Also I stopped at the customer service for something tried to make pleasantries and the woman just smirked and carried on talking to her colleague  about what she was doing the weekend. I work for one of the largest chain stores and I am shocked at the way your store is run. You need to take a serious look at your working procedures and staff training.					2016-07-08T11:34:43+0000	1467977683	2016-07-08 13:34:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You do know that cows are forcefully impregnated against their will and have their babies removed from them so humans can steal the milk meant to feed their babies. This process is repeated and repeated until their bodies give up meaning they are no longer of use so are sent to slaughter at a mere 5th of the age that they can live to. Can you imagine the pain they go through having their babies cruelly ripped away from them? This advert disgusts me and I am really disappointed in Tesco for putting these up in their stores. It s bad enough to turn a blind eye to what s happening  let alone to blatantly lie to the public!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13615160_10154375441987009_1205572628657801961_n.jpg?oh=86bb8d78641d779baa6ffd12661533ce&oe=58D9B6B4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13615160_10154375441987009_1205572628657801961_n.jpg?oh=8f0f4a4d2f4a6f3cb5976db8447aef2e&oe=5923F152	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154375441987009&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-08T11:33:16+0000	1467977596	2016-07-08 13:33:16	26	34	38	2	74	23	6	17	45	0	26	0	1	0	2	9	0

Please can you tell me what is the price you are paying our farmers per litre for their milk on average as your packaging says you pay depending on the farmers costs and explain more on your welfare standards. Picture also in comments section. Many thanks.

It is an outrageous lie. Not only are Tescos amongst the lowest in terms of animal welfare of their own range meat and dairy products compared with other supermarkets  there is also no way that drinking any animal milk helps care for that animal. Females are repeatedly impregnated  have their calves stolen at less than a day old and killed or sent to become veal and killed within a few weeks or if they are lucky enough to be born female they are spared only to be used again again like their mothers before them and all for human greed. They do not live in fields but instead cramped into factories never seeing the outside world until they are taken to slaughter. Milk is bad for humans  bad for the environment and horrendous for cows. It is utterly irresponsible of you to have this advert made up knowing what you do to these innocent animals. I hope that others will also make a fomal complaint and call for this to be removed.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13631487_10153898738543090_3006397797354154042_n.jpg?oh=78d06009ed42d18f48c764607033bc35&oe=5922CB85	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13631487_10153898738543090_3006397797354154042_n.jpg?oh=f338e93b6b80e22b8b1dd36e961a9fb7&oe=58E237F1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153898738543090&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-08T09:59:59+0000	1467971999	2016-07-08 11:59:59	28	27	32	0	59	21	1	20	66	0	28	0	0	0	2	2	0

Don t get me wrong I know I have to pay a premium for gluten free for my husbands illness and I have accepted that. However when I got it home and put it in the cupboard next to the other loaf of the same brand bought a few weeks back and frozen it looked smaller. Having looked at the weight underneath it has been reduced from a 500g loaf (which is a normal half sized loaf) to 335g!!!! Almost reducing the size by half and you have kept the price the same. You should be ashamed  taking advantage of people who have to buy this bread due to an illness.

I can say the lady working security was very willing to help but was unable.   I wish staff at my local store were able to read my mind and know my up coming actions so that they and I would know this would be of little importance as they knew what I d exactly be doing during my visit to store.

Think you will loose more customers because of this!					2016-07-08T01:03:08+0000	1467939788	2016-07-08 03:03:08	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I appreciate they might ve been worried about the back end sticking out but there was plenty of space at the back to get a van comfortably past with room on either side. There was no need to be right up on the pavement. Could you maybe ask your drivers to consider parks and wheelchairs  in future please? If it was raining and I was having to sit in the street waiting for him to move I d have been soaked right through  so it s just as well today was dry.

My boyfriend and I had purchased an item that needed a security lock removing and the female cashier (very polite and great service) asked her colleague for assistance removing it. Instead of assisting her in a professional manner he made several sexist comments about women not being able to think and do things for themselves. When I said that his comments were inappropriate he tried to drag my boyfriend into agreeing with him  which because he isn t a troglodyte he did not agree with. He continued further ranting about how women can t park cars or drive and upon paying for our items he turned to my boyfriend and said that he hoped that I wasn t driving! It is not professional to speak to a fellow colleague in that manner and it is not acceptable to speak to a customer as such either. Sexism is not banter and the cashier did not deserve to be publicly demeaned. I am sure that he does not represent what Tesco stands for.					2016-07-07T20:24:10+0000	1467923050	2016-07-07 22:24:10	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is horrendous to try to filter down to find what you want.  The old clothing website worked so well and was really easy to use.  I won t be buying Tesco clothing anymore if it stays as it is.  Happy to discuss further over the phone with someone if they want more detailed feedback as to the areas that are making it particularly hard to use.					2016-07-07T20:10:22+0000	1467922222	2016-07-07 22:10:22	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to foreign exchange in hartlepool  just to change 20 pound to turkish lira to be told turkey dont accept english stirling anymore. Bearing in mind my friend is in turkey and has no problem changing her english money . The cashier said that greece dont accept english either. Im annoyed to the fact is why she said that to me as i was wondering where does she get that information from .Did she read it in the sun by any chance. Ignorance comes to mind i have loads of friends that live in turkey and the country is struggling as it is and your member of staff is not helping is she . I only wanted that changing for my transfer to get a drink as the exchange rate is so low its much better in turkey .

I called you but the lady that answered the phone was not able to help other than asking me to go back to the store. This is not convenient at all as it is a bus ride away with a toddler  and would leave me out of pocket due to bus fares. Surely there is some other way I can be refunded? I have my reciept. I would appreciate any assistance. Many thanks.					2016-07-07T14:18:20+0000	1467901100	2016-07-07 16:18:20	0	23	0	0	23	23	8	15	18	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I was waiting to pay a man walked in very giddy  happy and with a huge smile on his face  shouting loudly to greet the staff and laughing to himself. The man clearly suffered from some kind of mental health.. Every single staff member smiled at him  greeted him and knew his name... Then a staff member came from behind the desk with a massive smile on her face and said  you ve got me today  picked up a basket and took his shopping list from him and off they went! I asked the cashier was she helping him with his shop and she told me she was  each time he comes in someone will help him ☺️ i know this is probably a Tesco promise (value) or even just expected of the staff team but to be so enthusiastic about helping him was so heart warming.. I know giving 100% great customer service all the time can be hard  everyone has their own problems at home  the weather isn t great today and we all would rather be at home with our feet up but this staff team made him feel like he was the only person around  special and loved. They all were talking amongst themselves about how he cheers them up and makes them smile 😊  I d love this staff team to be recognised 😉 a little treat for their work 🙏🏽 today is a good day! Tesco you should be proud of them all 😁					2016-07-07T13:24:58+0000	1467897898	2016-07-07 15:24:58	38	8	38	2	48	8	6	2	5	0	38	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had went to the garage this morning  and whilst I was hoovering the car I allowed my 2 year old son to  drive . After putting him back in his car seat and shutting the door  I came to the horrifying realisation he had managed to lock the door with my keys and phone inside! My son quickly became very distressed and hot locked inside the car and I felt completely helpless. A very kind gentleman offered his help and went to retrieve a member of staff  in the meantime I managed to talk my son through opening the door. The female member of staff (I didn t grab her name) offered lots of praise to my son  who by then was lapping up the attention whilst I was in floods of tears! Out of her own money she bought my son some crisps  sweets and a drink and offered me a cup of tea. It may only seem like a small gesture  but she managed to turn a potentially distressing situation into my son thinking he was the bees knees! She is a credit to you!					2016-07-07T12:05:39+0000	1467893139	2016-07-07 14:05:39	6	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Imagine my annoyance today she putting away my shopping  a chilled desert with a sell by date of 3/7/16  today being 07/07/16. My options it seems are to throw them away and lose the cost or make a round trip of sixteen miles to get a refund. Bishops park Tesco  bishops Stortford  this is not the first time! Almost every week I point out to staff problems with out of date fresh food. It really isn t good enough!my local Sainsburys is much closer  maybe I should shop there instead.!					2016-07-07T10:38:58+0000	1467887938	2016-07-07 12:38:58	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I always buy my icing from the Express store on Stanley Road 5806.  The store is brilliant  I told them which ingredients I used on a regular basis and they always stock the items for me  this also included margarine  jam and icing sugar.  Whenever a new manager took over I made sure the roll out icing stayed in stock.  So far the icing has been discontinued around 10 times and once again the store got it back in stock.  Last week yet again it was discontinued  so once again the staff said they would get it back in  with it being my busiest time I also asked for additional two boxes. I have gone in today only to find the store is on locked down on range management until week 24  that s 5 weeks away.  They could not even order the two extra boxes which is needed today. I am now having to run around giving up my time to get icing which should have been in the store Tuesday/Wednesday.  I always thought that Tesco was there to help support local businesses and I know this is not the case.  I thought you would have been glad people are loyal customers  I am now having to re think because I cannot be let down by you again.					2016-07-07T10:03:58+0000	1467885838	2016-07-07 12:03:58	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My little girl loves it! It broke on Saturday I took it back to the store I bought it from ( Oldham Huddersfield road) without my receipt because all though I hoard I don t hoard receipts! They didn t have any to swap it with. They said they would be getting some in Tuesday but to give it a day or so. They kept the bath seat for me so I don t have to lug it  a 8month and a two year old around. They called me today to say the bath seat was in. So off we drove to tesco only to find the lady had got mixed up and it was a bath stool! A wasted journey with 2 babies in the rain. It was a genuine mistake and she apologised but she couldn t tell me when the bath seat will be in. Hattie is currently being bathed in a baby bath as she is to little to sit unaided in the bath ( I tried she slipped all over the place like a little fish) can you do something? Can you get a bath seat sent to the Oldham store? Her big brother Frank is gutted and keeps asking for  baff time with Baba  can you reunite my babies in the bath? Please?

Firstly  my mum  who is elderly and unwell has been having her shopping delivered by you for the past year. Your staff are always helpful and friendly. This service is most appreciated.  Today mum receives a lovely surprise box filled with strawberries  cream  crumpets and other summery delights...just a little thank you  from you to her  for her custom.  A couple of weeks ago my dad had a surprise knock at the door. A Tesco baker! She hands over a loaf of bread and says in a  cheery voice... thank you for shopping at  Tesco!  ...... .....errr..... Strangely my dad doesn t shop at Tesco. Never has. Coincidentally a new Aldi was opening in town that same week.  As for me.... I ve shopped at Tesco for about the past ten years. I get a substantial weekly home delivery. I feed a family of three...not two  like my dad  or one  like my mum. What do I get?  NOTHING.  (Other than the option to go and shop at the new Aldi).  Thanks for that.					2016-07-07T08:59:10+0000	1467881950	2016-07-07 10:59:10	3	14	3	0	17	14	6	8	5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have eaten 2 but the third was rotten inside  the stone was crumbly and looked disgusting. I popped to my local store yesterday to buy Flat Peaches and more Nectarines as I thought I  just had a dodgy batch but was told they have been instructed to remove all Nectarines and Flat peaches from shop floor due to contamination issues? Is this correct? If so do you not think you should have issued a statement?					2016-07-07T08:09:11+0000	1467878951	2016-07-07 10:09:11	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I insisted that I can based on your TOS. He agreed although he made me feel guilty for doing so. Please clarify that I am indeed within my rights and if so PLEASE educate your staff so that customers are not forced to accept items that are not the same price when they checkout. In my case the prices was way above than what it was advertised as the promotion may be over. I shudder to think what I had to pay for if it was my mom accepting the order.

I had a badge that said  Customer Assistant ; I never wore it. The man that ran the store drove a BMW and had his initials loosely represented on his number plate. As you can imagine  I was in awe of the guy. I was seconded to the meat and fish counter; having as I did a depth of experience in neither. Wasn t difficult tho  you just chop stuff up and create a rapport with the customers. Anyway  to cut a long story short  the woman on the Fish Counter saw me as a threat and so got her friends to pop in and complain about me; saying I d handled meat with my hands  rather than wearing the Tesco gloves. So a customer arrives and I do my normal  you know this is cheaper and better at Aldi s shpiel; & this Scouser appears with his entourage and microscopically examines every move that I make. I knew exactly what was going on and so asked him if I could help? He may not have realised it  but it made him look such a buffoon; the woman I was serving laughed; she saw what I did. There are some terrible people who weasel their way into positions of power; it s our duty to deliver the odd glancing blow and make it appear accidental. Hoorah for us. Tom Slack  Caroline O Brien  etc.... It s a shame really cos I saw there some innovative thoughtful people  but they get drowned out by the silly shallow types who just want to do the bare minimum for the absolute maximum. http://www.tesco.com/store-locator/uk/?bID=4338 They have management meetings in the store and get in the way of customers....really? They actually create a  No Go  area of the store for customers; how absurd and ridiculous is that? Do your planning and management behind the scenes; if you have spare time or people; devote that & them to your customers. Don t stand there in your suits congratulating or admonishing each other whilst depriving yourselves of revenue and subliminally instilling in your customers  poor value   in that if 8 people in suits can stand there doing nothing...who s paying for it? Yes I m an ex employee  but I ve no axe to grind  I ve created a business from nothing without borrowing in a far more volatile market. It upsets me when I see mistakes accepted and dutifully unquestioned by lazy individuals without devoid of vision but bolstered with a detailed knowledge of rules....

Expected a delivery between 9pm and 10pm. On phoning in at 10.15pm it appears my order won t be arriving this eve. WTF! I have a baby of a few weeks old and a 6 & 7 year old who need breakfast in morning and a packed lunch. I will NEVER use Tesco again having ordered weekly for the last 5 years or so give or take a few store shops. Customer Service was appalling. I don t believe the vans are not tracked and the drivers cannot be contacted...... and I am extremely stressed and put out with your lack of fulfilment in your end of our contractual agreement.					2016-07-06T22:11:10+0000	1467843070	2016-07-07 00:11:10	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A couple of weeks ago I ordered shelf milkshakes and when delivered found they were 3 months out of their best before date...just to confirm that is 3 MONTHS! On Saturday I was shopping with my daughter and she put a chicken and pasta salad in the basket. As soon as we left the store she scoffed the lot and then told me it was out of date the day before. Fresh chicken purchased from Tesco that was 1 day past its  use by  date. I have sent numerous email to customer services but am very disappointed by their disinterested response.  All they have said is that they have emailed the manager of the store involved. What use is that to me? They even admitted by email it is illegal to sell poultry if it is past the  use by date. I emailed back and said that this is what happened and have had no response back.....strange that...?					2016-07-06T18:26:06+0000	1467829566	2016-07-06 20:26:06	0	5	0	0	5	5	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just spoken to tesco direct regarding an order/delivery. apparently it is my mistake that I only provided one phone number and that they have rang to re arrange delivery this is my work number and they have organised it with someone who answered the phone? They assumed it was a home number and that the person answering had the authority to do this? Obviously on the second delivery  as I had no idea  the delivery driver turned up and someone rejected the order? As my property is a flat they have not gone to the right place I was to blame again  for not givno the correct Address either? I now have no order and they won t reinstate it or honor the boost points as this was done in May? both operator and manager were very rude unhelpful and blaming. I did give  the flat number as I have checked this. I spend over 100k a year with tesco for my business- I think that they need to sort out how they look after their customers very unhappy tesco😡😤					2016-07-06T16:01:35+0000	1467820895	2016-07-06 18:01:35	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your bin bag manufacturers need to be told that if there is a press-seam directly underneath the yellow tie section  it will most likely tear the top of the bag off when you try to tie it. Annoying! And equally the black bags with ties never seem to have one half of the bag looped around the yellow tie actually sealed shut.. it s always open ended  rendering the ties useless!

It s the euros  it s summer  it s been broken for nearly a year now and if I have to drink any more warm beer or wine I will have to have a full blown tantrum. I was instore once and an actual fridge repairman was in there complaining about it too  even offering to fix it! But the manager  alas  said it had to be done via the correct channels. I m not sure what these channels are  or why they are so backed up  but if you could please unblock the channels and fix the refrigerator I would be very much obliged.

I m gutted :( I ve just sat down to have a cup of tea and a snack  as my shopping as been delivered earlier and the kids are in school my cupboards are full.... So I thought what delight can I have to eat... I decided on a scotch egg with some salad cream to dip it in... 😋😋😋 I sat down with said scotch egg and dipped the golden crumbed ball of goodness into the salad cream and took a bite  mmmmmm then careful went to dip it again being very careful not to let the egg escape out the hole I ve just created by taking a bite only to discover that there was actually no egg inside !!!!!! Well I m sure you can imagine my upset.... I m now sat here eating a ...... I m unsure what to call it.... A  scotch  ?? I ve had to phone my husband and let him know how upset I am but he doesn t understand and just hung up on me..... I then messaged my friends and they just laughed at me...... 😩 and to be honest the actually  scotch (no) egg  looks like it s laughing at me also... 😠	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13567075_10153955494193025_2217822902452777521_n.jpg?oh=82b7c76c11889c9a65ab18d7f51a0f8a&oe=58E588FF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13567075_10153955494193025_2217822902452777521_n.jpg?oh=e64d9b1075fd57a6553fc23f4353ecce&oe=5923D5F2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153955494193025&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-06T13:26:43+0000	1467811603	2016-07-06 15:26:43	217	91	324	81	496	91	56	35	450	0	214	3	8	94	1	0	0

All these money saving vouchers where you have to spend £50 to get money off your bill certainly does not encourage us to shop at Tesco (we are pensioners). If it was done proportionally and you were offered £2 for £20  £3 off for £30 etc surely more people would be encouraged to use the vouchers and maybe even increase sales! Come on PR people  put your thinking caps on. Morrisons have already lowered the £50 bar.					2016-07-06T11:57:24+0000	1467806244	2016-07-06 13:57:24	1	7	1	0	8	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Each needing a minimum £100 spend to qualify for discount.  Not much use for the smaller household then.  Thanks for thinking of them!    No wonder customers go to Aldi or Lidl.					2016-07-06T11:42:12+0000	1467805332	2016-07-06 13:42:12	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

(Great Dunmow Tescos) Carol (CSLA) and her stand in driver Jean (I think) turned up a little early as due to staff sickness they where drafted out of the store to help last minute.  On arrival they apologised to being early however I asked if they just pop the bags into the hallway as I am recovering from major surgery and unable to left things. Both ladies at this point brought all the shopping into the kitchen and unboxed it all even offering to help unpack as they where early as had time to spare.   I can t tell you how helpful these ladies were or how impressed I am with the service I received today.  Then to top it off as they where leaving they handed me a lovely thank you box of summer goodies.  I hope you could pass on this feedback to your senior staff and feed it down the chain to the store as I would love them to know I really appreciated their help :-)   Thank you  Martine	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13615075_10154180869175953_3671355171902106104_n.jpg?oh=d4c089754689f38e1a15498f6c744787&oe=5921017D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13615075_10154180869175953_3671355171902106104_n.jpg?oh=7bdfabcde73b0c771f715e164da92493&oe=591FA370	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154180869175953&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-06T10:18:27+0000	1467800307	2016-07-06 12:18:27	53	4	55	1	60	2	1	1	1	0	52	2	0	0	0	0	0

I recently bought a  just ham  no mayo  sandwich from your Bishop Auckland store. I read the ingredients on the back of the packet and notice that the sandwich contained  reformed ham . Now I understand that Tesco try to push equal opportunities etc  but I wonder whether the problems the ham have caused could have a serious affect on future sandwiches. The only way this could be sorted is for Tesco s to ensure that ham ham has been  cured . Can you promise me that Tesco s have precedures on place incase the   reformed  ham turns bad again...😉.

I was trying to make sense of the receipt - toddler girls and girls cherokee items were actually boys trousers and shorts. Once I looked at it a bit more I noticed that the £3 multi pack shorts do not appear however an odd item for £5 has appeared which I have concluded is the shorts but going through having been overcharged. Nothing in my shop cost £5 so wasn t an item being scanned twice. How can I get my £2 back?! (The items have been de-labelled as they are needed tomorrow but I still have the label attached to one pair).

I  put my card in cash machine   took my card out. done my shopping  meanwhile security man (one with gold teeth.sorry i don t  know his name) asked me about whether you took the money from cash machine   i was in a rush  i didn t bother to listen or follow him   took my groceries to the till   understand now   ididn t took the money from cash machine . which the machine sucked the money back in . i thought i  LOST MY AMOUNT.   I was trying to get hold of tescomanager or natwest bank   to my surprise the money was back ion my account in 3 days time .  Eventhough  it was a small amount   you won t get it free. I really appreciate  the entire team  of tesco express  that they were honest and sincere to all the customers. even i have seen they were helping the elderly citizens to help with the shopping . may god bless you all.  NICE  TEAM WORK. and thankyou for your honest and sincerity  towards the customers.					2016-07-05T18:32:27+0000	1467743547	2016-07-05 20:32:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I observed and also struggled to find a trolley with two seats!! I have two under 2 and need two seats in the trolley. However I had to pull trolleys out to get one with two seats as they are all mixed up! Luckily a member of the public came to my aid while tescos staff stood and watched.....  I have many friends who will have the same problem!  At other major super markets they are accessible and not all mixed up with the single seats  so why not at Tescos?					2016-07-05T18:24:26+0000	1467743066	2016-07-05 20:24:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I took in a prescription which had two items on  two packs of the same tablet. I was given one at the time and told they would order the second pack as it wasn t in stock. Two weeks later (and numerous visits back and forth to the pharmacy to try and collect the ordered tablets) and I was finally told that there was a manufacturing problem with the tablets. I was told to make another appointment with my GP to get a new prescription for the remaining tablets! So not only will I be wasting a GP appointment for a prescription that has already been prescribed I will also have to pay again for the new prescription leaving me out of pocket!  I was never told that both items were not in stock  just handed one pack and told to come back for the others. Had I known I would have gone elsewhere. I am not impressed!					2016-07-05T18:16:34+0000	1467742594	2016-07-05 20:16:34	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He made the order on Sunday 3rd July order number 4BKDWHPMG for 5 shirts and the order was processed and payment taken with the advices that they would be available in store to collect on Tuesday 5th.  He attended the store at 5.30pm today to be advised that only 1 had been sent as there was no stock left. At no time when placing the order was he advised that stock was in short supply and it seems strange that this was neither flagged at the time of the order or why full payment was taken when you were unable to complete your part of the sale process. This is yet another example of poor customer service from Tesco which I didn t believe could get any worse but you are consistent in your inability to even provide anything approaching an acceptable level of service. Why even once the order had been placed was he not contacted to advise you were unable to fulfil the order and a full refund made? It would have been better to not send any shirts especially as he had made a special visit to the store to collect them at considerable inconvenience to him. This also put your staff member in an unfortunate position which is unfair to them and although she was apologetic could not provide any suitable solution. Your processes are clearly designed for the benefit of Tesco rather than the customer and clearly your operational directors and managers do not have one iota of how to review processes to make them fit for purpose. The level of incompetence in all aspects of Tesco beggars belief and I am surprised that your profits have increased in the most recent quarter albeit by a  only paltry amount. He has now taken his custom elsewhere.					2016-07-05T17:56:27+0000	1467741387	2016-07-05 19:56:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You do trousers in larger waist sizes but not blouses in larger chest sizes!! Asda s range go up to 17-18 and since they now have to stay at school an extra year you are doing yourselves out of quite a lot of business.					2016-07-05T16:20:54+0000	1467735654	2016-07-05 18:20:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

All I have to say is  Well Done   The same mob who are baying for blood on the DM have no idea of the pressures and procedures in place to ensure alcohol sales are not sold to under 18 s. They have no idea of the fines which can be levied against the member of staff  not the company. And they have no idea it could lead to a dismissal.  And as for the manager who stuck up for his member of staff by saying her decision was final  again well done. You cannot overrule a member of staff in this way without having him or her second guess every single alcohol sale after that  and this is where alcohol is sold to the wrong person  as they no longer have the faith in their own judgement if overruled.  100% well done					2016-07-05T15:13:17+0000	1467731597	2016-07-05 17:13:17	10	1	10	0	11	1	1	0	1	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

My brother in law had finished his shopping and had gone back to the car.  I however was being served by a lady who took objection to the fact that the mop bucket I was trying to purchase did not have a bar code on it and I refused to go upstairs to the home and wear department to get another one for her to scan.  Once she had managed to get another one  she was extremely rude and unhelpful.  She did not tell me the price of my shopping and did not hand me my receipt ( I had to lean over and get it myself)  Once I had finished my transaction I waited around in the store so I could make a complaint about this.  I finally left the store being told that the matter would be dealt with and I am sure it has been.  Due to all this  by the time I got back to the car we were 5 mins over our parking allowance and my brother in law has been sent a parking ticket.  I am really annoyed at this as if your staff were not rude to customers there would have been no need for me to have been in the store so long.  I trust that you will be able to get this sorted out for me  as a £40 fine on top of staff being rude is not good customer service.

I mentioned a couple of times to the Fruit and Veg manageress    how lovely it is to be able to afford some fresh flowers for the home from their reduced flowers   which up until then always went out at the same time alongside the 7pm reduced fruit and veg . Until the next time I went that is . Reduced flowers have been moved over to the other flowers and get reduced by different staff at a later time .

Over the past 2 days we have been to the desk 5 times and every time while serving me or my boyfriend they have been talking amongst themselves.  (fine before serving but during is just rude)  The worse occasion was when my boyfriend was asking for some scratch cards and one lady interrupted him to talk to a lady returning from her break I mean literally turned and started having a conversation while he was mid sentence.  He did say to her it was very rude and she said sorry but her excuse was she was signing her in on the till but that was not the case.  Seeing as my boyfriend works as a deliver driver for Tesco he knows how important good service is and we both expected better from front of store staff.  This is not meant to get anyone in trouble just some feedback that would better the stores service.					2016-07-05T10:26:27+0000	1467714387	2016-07-05 12:26:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately since I ve moved we only have a Tesco so can no longer eat Asda s ready to eat chicken.   My partner kindly bought me a selection of Tesco s ready to eat chicken and cook in the bag chicken. Unfortunately every time I ate some of your chicken I noticed huge spikes in my blood sugars. I looked at the ingredients and saw sugar  dextrose (more sugar)  cornflour  potato starch  rice flour etc which all turn to sugar in the blood stream.   Why do you feel it necessary to put sugar in savoury products like chicken and add other rubbish like flour and starches to your chicken? If Asda s can manage without putting rubbish into their chicken  why can t you?					2016-07-05T10:22:39+0000	1467714159	2016-07-05 12:22:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every Monday I run a twins/ multiple birth group and stop off on route to pick up snack for the children (usually around 30 little mouths to feed) with my own twins in tow it can sometimes be a bit of a mission but Tesco Bletchley seam to be getting it so right at the moment making this little errand an enjoyable experience for us all. Yesterday I was able to park in one on the parent and child bays and easily locate a double trolley (esssential but very rare! I often have to search or move numerous single trolleys to get to one which is a mission and a half especially if I need coins to do this!) Tesco Bletchley have a designated area so I know exactly where to go to get one. Three different memebers of staff said good morning as we entered and then we were approached by another who asked if we knew about the free friut scheme  We did  but he also gave us a tip to take one of the fruit bags to put the rubbish in! I hadnt previuos through of this and have often wondered round with a handfull of orange peel or banana skin. The fruit scheme is a fantastic idea  not only does it promote healthy eating but its great to keeping little ones occupied and happy whilst shopping. My two now ask to go to the  fruit shop  if I say we are going shopping.  Once we had finished I was putting the twins back in the car and was approached by another member of staff who had come to take the trolley (and my little bag of friut peels). Thank you so much  its the little things that just make the day that bit easier and keep everyone smiling.					2016-07-05T10:08:31+0000	1467713311	2016-07-05 12:08:31	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The bad press you ve had and things your trying to change for the better with customers still in mind to give something as a token gift like this shows that tesco will always try to keep improving. Was very happy when my lovely delivery driver gave me this with my food shop this morning. He said that each van had 1 to give out to a customer and I had this. A little gesture really does go a long way.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13620719_10157307300275713_8817795968945263915_n.jpg?oh=7ca0468ca0471e1cee434de0390490b0&oe=58DD150C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13620719_10157307300275713_8817795968945263915_n.jpg?oh=f97dc528648ed51a6be436e0c740840c&oe=58DD8901	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157307300275713&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-05T10:06:55+0000	1467713215	2016-07-05 12:06:55	14	3	14	1	18	3	1	2	0	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

I haven t ordered since the clothing has moved to become part of the Direct website and won t bother again. The site is so slow; you can t search for things adequately; there is hardly any stock shown and is not at all user friendly. It used to be so quick and easy to put an order in and pick it up the next day whilst doing the shopping. It s a real shame. I ve wasted an hour  given up and gone to Next instead. It might cost me a few pound extra but so much easier.					2016-07-05T08:30:28+0000	1467707428	2016-07-05 10:30:28	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I rang Tesco and they emailed the partner because the company isn t open at the weekend.  I felt very annoyed because this needn t have happened and I couldn t have an instant refund.  I ve had plenty of delicates arrive intact  and those that haven t have been packaged properly anyway.  I put a very angry but factual review on the item site  only to have this  moderated   i.e. removed  even though it did not breach any guidelines.  It was suggested that I might want to write something else.  Well  I did want to  in response  but what I wanted to write would definitely not have been within the guidelines.   I replied to the email saying that I was not going to give any more reviews if they couldn t cope with a true opinion.  Although it didn t appear to be a  no reply  address  it apparently was  which made me even more annoyed.  So here I am to say that I will never  ever ever ever  waste my time doing another review for Tesco.  Some people will be quite relieved to hear it  I ve no doubt. But I will give the partner company a hard time since I couldn t do it on the site  and I detest being censored.					2016-07-05T08:30:12+0000	1467707412	2016-07-05 10:30:12	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would just like to thank the 3 members of staff very  very much for their excellent care and help. I m sorry but I can only remember one staff members name  Janice. There was another lady and the gentleman from security. I honestly can t thank them enough. After a trip to a&e it was found to be soft tissue damage  no break thankfully. I would be very grateful if you could pass on our thanks to those involved.					2016-07-04T21:16:27+0000	1467666987	2016-07-04 23:16:27	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

With so much plastic ending up in our oceans and ultimately in our fish isn t it time Tesco did more to move to natural packaging products. Many of your competitors use cardboard as an alternative.					2016-07-04T20:43:47+0000	1467665027	2016-07-04 22:43:47	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was with my 2yr old son who can be a bit of a handful!! Whilst I was grabbing a few items I needed from the clothes department my son decided he would make a run for it!! I gave chase and caught up with him but I slipped on the floor and took him down with me. I m not making a complaint about me slipping as I really shouldn t have been running. However  I was very disappointed in the fact that there were at least two members of staff stood near by (in the mobile shop and the clothes department) and not one single member of your team offered me or my son any help to get up off the floor (my hands were also full of shopping)  neither did they approach me to ensure we were both ok!! Not really the level of customer service I would expect from a large chain such as yourself  I ended up having to yell to another customer to help me up with my son and my shopping......so thanks skeggy tesco.....thanks for nothing!					2016-07-04T20:43:12+0000	1467664992	2016-07-04 22:43:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I noticed it has 1g of salt per pizza and you claim this is around 17% of the salt intake... but for an adult.  My daughter is almost 2 and I know this is 50% of her salt for the day  but it s an occasional treat and her diet is within guidelines (plus she never eats the whole thing!) but I consider myself a well educated individual who can make this informed choice. Considering on the back of your packaging it states it s designed for children would it not help parents to make a more informed choice by at least using the salt content of a child in the age bracket for which this product is being aimed? Or is it because your colour coding for  healthy choices  couldn t remain orange if you had to account for the younger age? I m not condemning the product (as I clearly buy it myself) but I do feel it is somewhat mislabelled nutritionally; there are some parents who rely on those colour coded labels to help them make good choices and I think they re being misinformed. Thanks for taking the time to read my comment.					2016-07-04T20:03:16+0000	1467662596	2016-07-04 22:03:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited your Bowness store today and was treated to some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Shop workers were rude  disengaged  uncaring and frankly unpleasant. It was quite obvious that not only did they not want to be there but that every customer was and inconvenience to them.  I purchased numerous groceries and a bottle of red wine  shortly after leaving the store I realised that the bottle of red wine had a crack in it and had leaked over my jacket in the shopping bag. I returned to the store and highlighted this to the staff member at the till  who couldn t understand what my problem was and what he should do about it. He offered to get me a new bottle of wine  as there was none on the shelf he went in the back to look for some. Whilst he was gone  another member of staff appeared and stated that he had been sent over to do a refund. After doing this I asked if anything could be done about my jacket to which he replied probably not but I ll have to check with the store manager. He then returned telling me that it was my problem and I should take it to the dry cleaners with no offer to pay for this or replace the jacket. At this point the cues built up and assistance was sought to resolve this. The original member of staff that I spoke to came back to support the tills  I asked him if he had got me another bottle of wine as I was still waiting for it  his response was did the guy not tell you we didn t have any more of that type red wine and I said that I still wanted a bottle of red wine to which he said I should go get one and needed to pay for it at the till.  The service I have experienced today has been outrageous and I am furious that such a large company has trained it s staff to provide customer service in this way.  I hope that you are willing to resolve this issue in a responsible manner and I look forward to your prompt response.  I have attached a copy of the receipt.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13599828_964509607001155_366808724735699398_n.jpg?oh=9212c1f64b27dca72daae312cdf09a26&oe=59213DA0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13599828_964509607001155_366808724735699398_n.jpg?oh=73f5fbade4c65d79938783fb81a8a896&oe=591D7F57	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=964509607001155&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-04T19:40:48+0000	1467661248	2016-07-04 21:40:48	2	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

She was absolutely delightful - kind  cheerful and most of all  had the time of day for my 4yr old son; she talked to him about fishing and all sorts while she put our items through the checkout and I just want her to know it was appreciated 😊					2016-07-04T19:06:06+0000	1467659166	2016-07-04 21:06:06	7	4	7	0	11	4	2	2	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Towards the end of this evening s visit  I got to the very end of the store by the wine section and suddenly remembered I d forgotten to buy something (it definitely wasn t a corkscrew which just so happened to be right at the opposite end of the building).   So I thought I d chance it and see if they had what I d forgotten in the wine section. Low and behold not one corkscrew was found but instead I found hundreds and hundreds of cocktail sticks! How could I forget I was serving a selection of amuse-bouches/Canapés to my guests at this week s wine tasting (it is my turn to host this week)  particularly as everywhere I looked there they were.   Now my guests will be able to enjoy a selection of cheese and pineapple  cocktail sausages and satay chicken without using their fingers and I can add sophistication by introducing olives.  As mentioned I didn t need a corkscrew because we all buy bottles with screw tops so thanks again Tesco Extra Swindon! 🙂	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13614931_10154191267057752_6833170588377198301_n.jpg?oh=a6e3766d896b27adf48a6e105e8b79bc&oe=58E621C3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13614931_10154191267057752_6833170588377198301_n.jpg?oh=5a79de5d1e5204bea5583ba882bd8431&oe=58E28CCE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154191267057752&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-04T18:51:17+0000	1467658277	2016-07-04 20:51:17	8	1	13	0	14	1	1	0	8	0	8	0	0	5	0	0	0

Why is it that every time I buy your food online the meat and fish is either a day or so until it needs to be used and the fish is always off? Iv been so put off by this that I have no choice but to shop online else where. I can t be the only one who has experienced this? I shouldn t have to have the produce that nobody else wants? the fish is always in date but every time I go to use it it smells rancid making me think your food is stored in sub standard conditions? Maybe left out to long when packing? This needs to be looked into!					2016-07-04T16:51:13+0000	1467651073	2016-07-04 18:51:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Hi Kay   I’m really sorry to see that you’ve found a sharp foreign body in your Mediterranean Grains; I can understand your concerns  though I would like to assure you that we can resolve this issue for you  though it will require you to return to store at your earliest convenience if you can?  My colleagues were correct in advising you to return to store to fill out a health form  as the store are best placed to send off your packaging  and sharp object for further investigation by our technologist and supplier; we cannot initiate the process without the packaging and sharp object in our hands  therefore this is why you were advised to do so.  Returning to store will give us the best chance at ensuring that the batch isn’t jeopardised on a wide scale  and you will receive a refund at our customer service desk  and will also be given a reference number which we would greatly appreciate if you could provide to us once you’ve popped into store.  The next step would be that you’d receive a written response from us in 14 days.  I hope this helps clear things up  though I do understand the inconvenience this causes  and I am truly sorry.  Please let me know if you have any further questions in the meantime and I’ll be happy to assist.  Kind Regards  Rob – Customer Care Thanks for your response Rob.   I m a little perturbed to be honest. Firstly  I subscribe to a delivery service with Tesco as I currently do not have a vehicle. I rely on a Tesco Express store for  top up  items.  I could have been seriously injured if I had swallowed this piece of metal and yet Tesco is expecting me to go out of MY way to rectify this situation. I would have to get two buses to the store or a cab at £16 return. Other than that  it would be an hours walk.  Considering I work full time and have a family and commitments  I feel that it is a little unfair that you want me to put myself out in such a way  when I have done absolutely nothing wrong!  Regards  Kay  Hi Kay   I completely understand your frustration. Unfortunately without you returning to store we will be unable to investigate.

We did our weekly shop with you this week instead of Ocado as we are trying to save a bit of money. The shop was a bit cheaper which we were delighted with  however we have just gone to make a meal and found that your  Alaskan Frozen Salmon  is not only grey and distinctly unappealing  it is also stamped as produced in China. Given the two countries are over 7000 km apart i m intrigued how this is possible. Can you let me know? Oh and your onions were rotten in the middle too.					2016-07-04T15:05:03+0000	1467644703	2016-07-04 17:05:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went into store around lunchtime to do a weekly shop grabbed a hand held scanner as I always do. I changed my mind on using this.(not realizing the uproar it would cause)  I finished my shop went to a checkout where the lady said oh u have a scanner I said it s ok we didn t use it in the end. The lady had called another member of staff a runner called George he asked very rudely why I hadn t used the hand held scanner I said I had changed my mind in using this he said to me when customers take a scanner and do not use them we ban them from using scan and shop from our store?!?  I thought he was joking but he continued to say this and asked again why I hadn t used the scanner again I said I had changed my mind. I explained I wasn t aware of the rules of Tesco and nowhere does it state if u take a scanner and don not use it you will be banned from using this service in your store this maybe a  tesco  rule but I wasn t aware of it.  I was so angry packing my shopping I said to the lady who served us I was fuming with the customer service I was given she did apologize and for the way he spoke to me. I am 17 weeks pregnant and definitely did not deserve to feel angry about something so small.  Going forward I think something needs to be said to your customers as I shop here more than 3 times a week and  I m sure many customers are unaware of this  rule   as I was.					2016-07-04T14:53:48+0000	1467644028	2016-07-04 16:53:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I approached her about it she told me she worked for Tesco so could park there and I m a silly cow! In an aggressive manor in front of my 6yr old. Her surname might be Heaton  a pic of her car attached - kidlington high street store. Please have a word with her! It s hardly customer service is it!!  I won t be coming back!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13532935_10154204578175330_2633470847559395039_n.jpg?oh=441a45c57484b29d696ca598395a7748&oe=59238D70	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13532935_10154204578175330_2633470847559395039_n.jpg?oh=f0fbfeb247011ff656cd9d8927dfdf36&oe=5920167D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154204578175330&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-04T11:24:41+0000	1467631481	2016-07-04 13:24:41	0	4	1	0	5	2	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

When I ask what s going on  the line manager says there s  a problem with supply  - I say: Find a new source  then!  I ask  for the umpteenth time about lack of fennel on display - he says (wait for it):  We can t seem to get any!  I imagine there are  growers out there who would love to be supply the mighty Tesco  if only they could be bothered to look for one.					2016-07-04T10:48:42+0000	1467629322	2016-07-04 12:48:42	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last year I thought that the non delivery of online Groicery Shopping in the Auchterarder was a mistake and would be a one off. But here we go again. No delivery from Wednesday 6th to Monday 11th inclusive. I rely on my online as I am disabled and so do many more people. I am really annoyed!!!!!!!

We proceded to Tesco in St Stephens hull were i purchased my son a tuna sandwich and myself a HEALTHY been the ironic word here BBQ chicken sandwich . we then went to the car and ate our sandwiches. Id eaten half of my sandwich just about to take a bite out of the other half and out pops a eluminous green head .. Startled i immediatly put the sandwich back in the box my son at this point shouting there s a beetle in your sandwich daddy .... I proceeded back to Tesco and returned the sandwich who in fairness were apologetic my son at this point  refusing to eat his sandwich.. This little Beetle in my sandwich i found out is a Japanese beetle they come from asia and normally eat plants in groups i will never eat a boxed sandwich again from this experience and Tesco are saying it will take 2 weeks to look into the situation before anything can be done .. Im afraid it should be done straight away i attach a photo if the beetle tucking into my sandwich lets get sharing	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13533088_10157187390435232_4791996462175869957_n.jpg?oh=b0bc8db75abd1849ef7b2ea5b1061f73&oe=59228A85	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13533088_10157187390435232_4791996462175869957_n.jpg?oh=e9a58f7f4faacbab380a66c8b06ec81c&oe=5919E688	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157187390435232&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-04T10:36:17+0000	1467628577	2016-07-04 12:36:17	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And just home from hospital with a premature baby it was a shock to say the least to have a knock on the door from a tesco delivery driver to say he had damaged our car while trying to deliver to next door!!!! He said he was only 19 and been driving 2wks!!! Training needed here I think Tesco! And customer service training  at chineham Basingstoke store needed also as just called to speak to store manager as not called as promised yesterday to be told he only calls customers back if its warranted!!!

You follow the steps and advertise tesco on our page then message 15 friends. When you click to collect voucher it says error. All my friends tried and got the same result.

In August I’ll be 65 yrs. old  a husband  father and Grandfather who has lived in this country all his life and never  ever been in any trouble with the authorities (apart from a couple of speeding fines). I’ve paid my taxes and worked to feed  house and clothe my family who have now mostly moved away from home and are all working hard trying to do the same. I now work as a licenced taxi driver in my home town of Ferryhill… I was a martial arts instructor many years ago and had to be police checked to teach kids…. I have been Police Checked for the last 4 years – it’s always been completely clear – and I regularly do school runs as a matter of course. I am known by my family and friends as an honest law-abiding person… My wife and I are going to Turkey on Tuesday and we needed a few items of shopping before we leave so she asked me to visit the Tesco store in Belmont to purchase some dog food (Always Tesco brand  for senior dogs) some cat food  she prefers Whiskas  and most importantly  a suitcase  as our youngest daughter  who is at a performing arts school in Sidcup  seems to have borrowed one of the cases we were hoping to use…. I dropped my wife off at Durham School  where she works as a sports coach and drove to the Tesco store. After collecting a trolley  I went into the store and proceeded to put into my large trolley a large red suitcase  some dog food  both wet and dry  some cat food  again both wet and dry  then thought I’d treat myself to a Thai takeaway meal and a pack of Foster’s lager (I usually drink wine but sometimes you feel like a change yes?) to go with my Thai Green curry. Now that the children are no longer living with us we can feel confident that we can afford some of these little luxuries now and again  and I knew that there was enough cash in my current account to easily cover the items I was buying. In fact I also intended to purchase some Turkish Lira for the holiday we are looking forward to taking  so I proceeded through the self – checkout area  scanning each item through including the big red suitcase and putting them on the scales. When it came to the lager the chime goes off and the young lady in the area has to check if you look old enough to buy alcohol… at this point I made my usual little joke  asking if she needed to see my driver’s licence  at which she smiled politely  shook her head and held up her bar code to authorise the purchase. I finished scanning my items  touched the “finish & pay” button on the screen  put my debit cd into the machine  entered my pin which was accepted  put my seven items (including that rather large red suitcase) back into the large trolley and proceeded towards the main entrance  which everyone knows is guarded by an alarm system  now looking forward to getting home and enjoying a Thai Green Curry and a couple of cans of lager….At this point I remembered the Turkish Lira we were going to need for our holiday  so I went to the kiosk  which is near the entrance and bought £200 worth  again using my debit card  put them into my wallet and proceeded to leave through the main entrance when the aforementioned alarm went off!!!  Now this has happened to me  and I’m sure many others in the past when an alarm hasn’t cancelled properly  or a security tag is left on something so at this point I was perfectly relaxed  expecting the problem to be sorted so I could be on my way  and I obviously made no further attempt to leave the store  but looked to the security guard to help. He came over to me and asked for my receipt  which I looked for. I knew I had just got one for the Lira  but after checking in my wallet and my pockets realised that I must have forgotten pick it up at the self-checkout. The guard then asked me to come with him back to the checkout till  which I was happy to do  expecting one of the young ladies to have maybe noticed my receipt and picked it up… I led him to the correct till (No. 75) half expecting to see my receipt but there was nothing there… I explained that it was only ten or fifteen minutes since I had gone through the till and asked if there was any way to check back through the system as I was certain that I had paid for the items. The checkout supervisor checked the system while I was accompanied back to her desk but couldn’t find a record of my purchases so at this point  thinking maybe I’d made a mistake I obviously offered to pay for the goods immediately  but my offer was refused. I was then asked to go with the security guard  which again I was fairly relaxed about as I thought that once I explained what had happened  we would all have a laugh at my silly mistake (which I am still unable to explain) and I could get off home  then the guard explained that as I had attempted to leave the store without paying I had committed a theft and would be taken to the manager as a shoplifter!!! At this stage I forcefully informed the guard that it wasn’t theft  it was a mistake  but he made no comment. I was taken to the far end of the store and told to go through a door which led into a fire exit  with a small room occupied by two ladies who were being interviewed by a policeman and policewoman  the policeman came out and after being informed that there was “another one” said “You’ll have to wait… take a seat” indicating a chair. There were a couple of other people standing around  one of which I now presume to be a store detective  another who appeared to be management and one in a shirt and tie who came in a little later and I now know is the store manager. I attempted to talk to any of these people who were prepared to listen saying that I was a 64-year-old family man who has never been in trouble with the police or any other authorities but they weren’t exactly receptive to my explanations… I said that we were going to Turkey on Tuesday and had just come in to buy a suitcase…. At which I was told “well you won’t be buying that one” indicating the large trolley with the large red suitcase next to me…. The evidence I suppose of my attempted theft during which I’d cleverly attempted to use my Ninja skills to push a large trolley with 7 unpaid for items  including the large red suitcase past an alarm which everyone knows is there  under the gaze of a uniformed security guard???? The policeman was moving back and forth from the small room into the store itself and I managed to get him to listen to my account of going through the self-checkout  having to wait for the young lady to authorize my alcohol purchase  having the security tag removed from the large red suitcase  before entering my pin in the machine and it being authorised…. He asked the store staff if there was any way they could check my story and someone went off to find the young lady in question. They retuned and informed me that the young lady only remembered removing the security tag from the large red suitcase…. I then said that as Id purchased alcohol  they would also have had to authorise that  which the policeman asked the store staff to confirm. They agreed  saying she would have had to hold her barcode up to the machine to do this  as I remembered. I then managed to inform him that I was a licenced taxi driver and repeated that I’d never been in any trouble before. At this he asked me for my name  date of birth and current address  which he wrote down and disappeared inside the store again. On his return and I think this is when the manager appeared  he said to me that he’d checked and I have never been charged or warned or even been in a car stop (apart from a couple of speeding tickets) as Id said. He asked me if I had the money to pay for the goods and I informed him I certainly had. He suggested that I be allowed to do so  but also said that his impression was that there was “some dishonesty involved”!! I assured the policeman that there was no dishonesty  just an honest mistake… He asked me to apologise to the store manager – which I did  for making a mistake  and informed me that I was now banned from the store!!!! I was then escorted to the self-checkout by the same security guard  who waited while I scanned my 7 items including my big red suitcase  advised me to hang on to my receipt and escorted me to the entrance where I was allowed to leave. I feel wronged by Tesco’s as a law-abiding person  I maintain that I didn’t actually attempt to leave the store but stopped immediately I knew there was a problem and sought the help of the security guard. I agree that I made an honest mistake  but I offered to pay to rectify the mistake immediately. How many shoplifters do you think attempt to push a whole large trolley with 7 unpaid for items including a large red suitcase  through a security system that everyone knows is there  would expect to get away with it??? I can assure you and I swear on my life and the lives of my children and my children’s children that I was never at any time attempting to steal anything from the store. Why would I do so at my time of life  now that we are fairly financially comfortable?  We use the store quite a lot  including the optician  the café and spend quite a lot there. I want to appeal against the ban and I feel that I was treated as “Guilty until proven innocent” by the staff and the police in the store… I was proved to be telling the truth about my clean record – surely you can believe someone could make an honest mistake???  I would like the ban lifted and feel I am owed an apology of my own…. A Photograph of the 7 items I allegedly attempted to steal on Thursday evening...   They were cleverly stacked like this in a large shopping trolley in order to hide them from view while I pushed them through the alarm system past that eagle-eyed security guard... I don t really know how this happened... maybe I took my card out of the reader too quickly???? Is this a possibility??? If so there should be a warning... If I had gone to a manned checkout this wouldn t have happened..... This wasn t Theft this was an HONEST MISTAKE.... I wont let this lie as I feel my reputation is now besmirched by this 3 year ban from the store... I may or may not want to use the store again  but either way if you dont lift the ban  I ll certainly take my complaint higher/MORE PUBLIC.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13439019_1044569492286143_7952712698565482426_n.jpg?oh=9ee746f2c6b45c24f3f6dafa22520881&oe=59209006	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13439019_1044569492286143_7952712698565482426_n.jpg?oh=9a79feff0ab4bc3e96c6f5adcea1edae&oe=5918336D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1044569492286143&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-04T08:16:20+0000	1467620180	2016-07-04 10:16:20	3	19	4	0	23	19	8	11	10	0	3	0	0	0	1	0	0

Such a massive help and very greatly appreciated. We raised lots of money to buy new play equipment for our brand new community centre! Tesco is our nearest supermarket and probably used by the whole estate  so to support us this way is fab. This team of 3 helpers were great PR for Tesco and an asset to the Brockworth store!

We were over 30 minutes late in collecting our  click & collect  order due to traffic.   There was a mobile number on the door of the hut which we called and he said  I ll be straight there. I kept apologising and he was so professional  said  don t worry   asked if we d had a nice day  held the trays so we could unload into our car. It wasn t until I asked him what time he finished that he told me 4pm and by this time it was about 4:40pm. I said you should have left our order  it was our fault. He response was  I couldn t go home knowing you didn t have your food  in the best condition. It s no problem at all. He was positive and smiling all of the time. A huge asset to the store. Thank you so much!					2016-07-03T22:13:18+0000	1467583998	2016-07-04 00:13:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have only ever used you three times for my online shopping  the third time was today. This was the third time my delivery was late and the second time half my shopping was missing because your delivery drivers cannot be bothered to do their jobs properly! At least I finally received the other half of my shopping today.......6 hours and 15 mins late! My delivery was scheduled for 12-1pm and nothing came until 1.10 (late is late albeit 10mins)  my missing shopping has JUST been delivered at 7.15pm - over 6 hours late and 5 I repeat 5 calls to your customer service team! I have been refunded the delivery charge and hope to be refunded correctly for the rubbish substitutes you tried to palm me off with. The gesture of  good will  ecoupon you have sent me for £7 is insulting! As well as useless as I won t be buying from you again.

I always thought a business is suppose to operate in a professional manor. I can t believe how this store functions  what does the manager do? I think it s time you send someone from your headquarters to get this store operating correctly! It is clearly operated by an unorganized or uneducated manager  from what I see. Check out my Facebook Page to see the photo s of your Klatovy store  what a mess! Just know that this is only a few photos  there is much more mess there.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13495191_10209817365017343_911083768372479588_n.jpg?oh=3b7cc722bc2b75a25e7373bbc46ecec9&oe=58E2F4D6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13495191_10209817365017343_911083768372479588_n.jpg?oh=30b4782ef61a9091918949556f3ff5af&oe=591D4BC3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209817365017343&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-03T16:25:07+0000	1467563107	2016-07-03 18:25:07	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After a lot of hassle (because I didn t want to bring the stinky leaking packaging back in the car and they wouldn t replace it even though I had these pics?) I contacted on the live chat and Tescos is now refunding but I want to tell everyone to be careful have had many issues with rotten veg and fruit on the day of purchase from them and can see others have too but this just takes the biscuit  it is so dangerous to sell meat so gone off it smells like decay!! I have contacted food standards as these things can make an adult sick enough I can t bear to think what if it was a baby  elderly or clinically ill person consuming these things? Be careful! I also have a friend who says she had flies hatching in her oats once!

Before you moved your clothing department  parents in Jersey could rejoice at buying your school uniform for our children.. Yay! Affordable school uniform delivered to our doors! Affordable clothing for our kids! And us! Brilliant!  Then you went and moved in with Tesco Direct. Tesco Direct hates us. Won t deliver anything to us. When i ve queried it i ve been told that  No one will deliver to you for a reasonable amount  (i shall make sure to tell my lovely MyHermes driver that him delivering all the f&f parcels to me over the last 3-4 years has been a figment of both of our imaginations)  Please can you change this? Can t we have our clothing delivered once more?   On a serious note  its alot of money waiting here that would happily spend on Tesco clothing and get it delivered. Especially in the run up to back to school #justsaying  Pleeeeeeeeeeeeease?!					2016-07-03T14:50:44+0000	1467557444	2016-07-03 16:50:44	10	62	10	1	73	62	21	41	16	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

My nan lives in Spain so we visit the same place every year... We had never been bitten last year or the year before. I currently have just over 40 mosquito bites. We were wondering why it was happening since we never usually get bitten. Wondering what we have done differently this year. Then I thought   oh  the suncream!  With a bit of research I have found several articles (the daily mirror etc) that say TESCO sun cream attracts INSECTS because of its sweet smell! Switched to Nivea yesterday and we haven t been bitten ONCE!!! What if a child used this sin cream? I m having to spend my holiday itchy  wearing leggings because my legs are so badly bitten its started to bruise now too just because of some stupid sun cream. My holiday is quite well ruined  my legs are blotchy  its hot  I m itchy  I have bumps everywhere. Sadly I can only upload one photo for some reason but I have 30 on my right leg  3 on my back  one on my hand  6 on my left leg  3 on my left arm and 10 on my right arm in the matter of two days... They take 3-5 days to heal so I would have left Spain by this point. Can t wait to hear your response.

I am very seriously considering not shopping from tesco in future as the reason for my calls was the item I received was Not the item I ordered! Then to be told if I want to order the replacement for when I need it by (Tuesday afternoon) I will have to pay an additional £5.95 shipping when the error was not mine!!

I have complained here before and literally nothing has been done. And once again  the past two shopping experiences have been no less disappointing.   Last week a click and collect order - half my order wasn t bagged as requested. The guy there was very helpful  after commenting  yeah  the pickers just get lazy sometimes  (!). I also had items missing (reported) but it just feels like your customer service doesnt care  This week i ordered ribs from your counter. This time it was a delivery. The biggest weight you can order was £1.40 worth. In a household of 7 I realised this was a minimal amount so I order 4 times that. But I only received 1 lot. Once again reported.....I got my £1.40 back for my measly mouthful of ribs I received but overall I m left feeling like Tesco really don t give a monkeys.  What s the point? What is supposed to be a helpful and convenient service is often a shambles and a waste of time (and  money).

Happy customer!! Thank you.					2016-07-03T10:34:55+0000	1467542095	2016-07-03 12:34:55	5	5	5	0	10	5	2	3	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s Pride in Edinburgh today and I popped into your Leith Walk Express store. All of the staff had Pride t-shirts on with  out at Tesco  on the back.

So after promising my daughter today to do a spot of baking we took a trip in to your store today. I purchased what I thought was a kids paw patrol cookie baking kit  it wasn t till I got home and un packed my shopping I realised that it was a Peppa pig  cupcake set that someone had clearly DELIBERATELY glued a paw patrol picture covering the entire front of the box!

I was printing some photos of my late Grandad on the iSnaps photo machine  I d been using the machine for a few minutes when a member of staff came up to me and rudely said:  Can you hurry up? I want to go on my break.  That is an actual quote of what the member of staff said to me. I m absolutely disgusted  that a) there was nobody available to take over said staff member s shift so that people could continue to use the services and b) there could have been nicer and politer about what they said and worded it differently. I felt so under pressure printing my photos that I didn t bother printing  the majority of the other photos I wanted to print because I felt so uncomfortable and rushed. Would I go to a restaurant and get told to hurry up and eat my food because the staff wanted to go home? I think not. What s this all about Tesco? Not on at all. I will be purchasing my photos at Boots from now on.					2016-07-02T14:17:14+0000	1467469034	2016-07-02 16:17:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I rarely have need to complain or take stuff back but today I decided to. I d bought a bunch of peonies which is a luxury item and waited for them to open   unfortunately after a week they hadn t but still looked healthy so topped the water up and waited....After 2 weeks they hadn t open and started to die. I know in the grand scheme of things this is small and insignificant to tesco or the world but to me a bunch of flowers brighten my day up when I need it.  So I took them along to my local tesco and explained what had happened- the manager was very fixed and ridged in the fact that they are only guaranteed for 5 days- I tried to explain that I understood but wanted to give them longer to bloom but he wouldn t move on his decision to replace the purchase. so I left the dead peonies in his bin and walked out to do my shopping else where  very upset at the reaction I got.  Kind regards Leisa Orme					2016-07-02T13:22:01+0000	1467465721	2016-07-02 15:22:01	0	4	0	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just been into Tesco Express in the old town in Stevenage for a ham and egg sandwich. I started eating it and quickly stopped when I realised the egg was frozen. My husband is driving me as I m on way to see my Mum in hospital so I haven t got time to go back to return. I thought I d call the store out of courtesy to let them know there fridges may be too cold but nobody is answering the phone. So I m telling you. Hopefully you can make out the ice attached to the egg in the sandwich and you can sort it out!   You may as well also be aware that I ve got to go back into the Baldock store sometime this weekend and return a pair of shorts with the security tag still attached. Second time that s happened to me in 2 weeks.  Yours getting very irritated by Tesco at the moment	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13590399_10153682363291569_8931703077800789078_n.jpg?oh=cc2fef36d4e6d9715946798c001c3d10&oe=58EB1F29	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13590399_10153682363291569_8931703077800789078_n.jpg?oh=477fa8bc1706f5f45fffb427ec211025&oe=58DDAE24	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153682363291569&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-07-02T12:12:03+0000	1467461523	2016-07-02 14:12:03	2	8	4	0	12	8	3	5	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	2	0

When I say  served  what I actually mean is not spoken to AT ALL  he busied himself with his till  then got my payment amount up without even asking which pump I was at  I put my card in the machine  which was clearly playing up but instead of him explaining that just left me to crack on until at the third attempt it finally worked. Then he thrust my receipt in my hand and turned to chat to his colleague.  Epic customer service. Well done Brian.					2016-07-02T12:03:47+0000	1467461027	2016-07-02 14:03:47	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We got an email the following day (the day the double up deal ended) which went straight into our junk folder as well as us being busy all that day (hence ordering them on the 25th June). Tesco will now no longer provide us with the £10 that we are entitled to and are making things very difficult.					2016-07-02T10:53:05+0000	1467456785	2016-07-02 12:53:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can assure you this is a sterling note and is treated in the same way as English and Scottish. I was informed by the cashier that he would have to check if they could accept it! He called over a manager who declared that it wasn t  legal  and therefore they couldn t accept it. I am utterly appalled that your staff would be so ignorant as to not recognise sterling from another part of the U.K. and refuse to accept what is very much legal tender!					2016-07-02T10:20:59+0000	1467454859	2016-07-02 12:20:59	18	5	20	2	27	5	4	1	0	0	18	0	0	1	0	1	0

Unfortunately  my online order that was due for delivery this morning has been canceled due to the total amount of my groceries being £2.60 under my voucher total  at no point   at the point of purchase did your online system ask me to reduce the number of vouchers prior to completion and pay the difference! I paid a further £3.40 as instructed to finish the sale and I was given an order number and my time slot confirmed.   This morning I received a call at 0838 and again at 0901 from the local Tesco store who we re supposed to be delivering my goods stating   that the payment has not gone through do you have another card we could use? I explained that I d used my vouchers to which they said we have no clarification of this and that I would have to call customer services myself to resolve this  do you have another card we can use??? I said no   as I m not prepared to pay twice  she then told me to call customer services to which they basically said  they would refund my vouchers and I would have to place the order again  but not a delivery if you want the goods today  you would have to click and collect! She also said to make sure that your total order is under the total amount when using my vouchers and then pay the difference  again!!!   They then called me back stating they have looked at my club card account to which they have confirmed that my vouchers have been redeemed at store and can t understand why they haven t completed the order  they also said they can t reimburse my vouchers now so they will have to email me an e-voucher for the total amount of £57.00  My question to you Tesco is: Why doesn t your system do this at the point of sale? I m now without delivery at home with two kids  I m still £3.40 out of pocket because of this error... It s not the £3.40 that I m bothered about   it s the lack of customer service at the store  they couldn t be bothered and they were not interested  apart from asking for alternative payment details!   I may have to rethink where I spend my money on groceries in the future! Shocking....					2016-07-02T09:33:41+0000	1467452021	2016-07-02 11:33:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am not a computerphobe but prefer to shop in person not online.  Yesterday I went into the Chesterfield store - reluctant hero to buy a top I d spotted pre payday! (I am not a fan of the store as it is like a trip to Meadowhall to buy a pint of milk so I prefer to shop in smaller branches of the store)  It was not available in my size so I asked a lovely assistant if it could be ordered into store or found at another store for collection.  Yes  wonderful...Happy Shopper!  However  it had to be ordered online on a public use screen thing with a card and would cost £2.00 to have it delivered so I could trail 8 miles to collect it.  Needless to say I left disappointed and a little frustrated. Why can t cash be used to order items in store and delivery charges for collection from store????					2016-07-02T08:46:27+0000	1467449187	2016-07-02 10:46:27	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have suffered a recurring skight skin irritation that has been dormant for over a year. Tesco waterproof plasters are ideal for keeping the treatment on. Cannot find these at another competitor store sadly. Decided to visit the IRLAM EXTRA store to stock up. Last year  the staff inability to gather the stray trolleys resulted in one being blown into my car causing almost £200 of damage which your compsny neglected to refund. This morning at 905. There were at least 30 strays that I counted. I highlighted this to two members of staff One was a very young duty manager  the other a trolley supervisor who told me he was not starting til 930. The duty manager told me it was not his role. Well... It us the manager s role to step in to staffing gaps is it not?. Today s visit has done nothing to win me back to doing my £100 weekly shop  £60 a week petrol and pharmacy custom. Very poor service. Do you have anything to add?					2016-07-02T08:42:43+0000	1467448963	2016-07-02 10:42:43	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

If there is a problem and you need it fixed or refunded  you will get the run around saying that you must go through the company they got it from and its not there problem because they are just a web portal for third party vendors. I just wonder if you brought a carton of milk and it was sour should you have to call the farmer or maybe even have to contact the cow directly. In the future I will not be shopping with Tesco  and anyone that asks me about shopping there I will be glad to tell them to shop elsewhere.					2016-07-02T08:25:02+0000	1467447902	2016-07-02 10:25:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The package says to email one address.... That throws back a message saying use the eBay message system.  All I want to know is how quickly this can be resolved as this is a present for somebody so need to rectify it ASAP.  The item is Caroline Herrera 212 but I got sent the sports version.

Me and partner went to get him a smart top for work and thought this was a bargin at £6. To then get to the till to find out it was £9. There was no staff around to make a complaint too  so I bit the bullet and bought it anyway. But labels should be clear and not misleading. Very unhappy!!

I bought a large container of extra thick cream. It was only slightly thicker  if at all thicker  than double cream. It was runny straight out of a cold fridge. It was to serve as part of a dessert. Thanks Tesco. I guess a company that sells stuff with fake farm labels just isn t concerned with quality at all.

So I buy alot of tesco s products and I m shocked that your company fails at the most basic thing s.   Let s start with tesco s bank  You don t accept your own bank cards at your petrol pumps! What the hell is that all about! if anything there the only cards you should accept because there the only cards you will know you will get the money from 100% and not only this but due to what ever limitations have been put on the bank cards this also stops them being used in places like a post office which is a massive inconvenience when I have to drive all the way to tesco s to get cash out just to go back to the post office to buy gas.  Tesco s stores  Now where to start with this! more than a few share of your staff don t have the basic understanding of customer service! and the third party company you have hired for security need to wind there necks in!  (Ie  tonight I was doing a small shop which time I had finished getting everything I wanted all the tills were closed  which I had a small trolly full to the brim and I went to the self checkouts and the member of staff there went up to another customer with a small basket and offered to open up the till for him leaving me having to wait after I scanned half my items for him to put a pin in the machine because I couldn t put all the items on the weight section of the machine. Which clearly he should have stopped me the second I walked into the self scan area which the staff normally do if I go in there after 11pm.)  Which this is just a small few things I ve picked out which quite frankly makes me to question why I have any services off you or go to your stores.					2016-07-01T22:24:23+0000	1467411863	2016-07-02 00:24:23	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The item is scrubbed from the original receipt and till produces a slip for customer service to keep as proof of return but nothing for the customer??? I ve asked at customer service tonight and the store manager doesn t have any idea why this happens and a customer service assistant have an excuse of data protection that s why the customer can t have a new receipt!

Just wanted to commend your Batley extra store on their customer service. My partner and I shop there every week and were missing a few items from our click and collect order tonight. A quick call to your customer services had me speaking to the duty manager (sorry didn t catch his name) and the items were delivered directly to us within half an hour  plus some extras for our trouble  which was a lovely gesture. I fully appreciate that these things happen and it is very rare  I don t normally post things like this but I feel people are very quick to complain and not as quick to give praise where it is deserved. So thanks to Batley Tesco and the telephone customer services! 😊					2016-07-01T20:43:38+0000	1467405818	2016-07-01 22:43:38	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Seeing as it s a new product  can you tell me whether there are plans to bring the other two flavours back  and when?

I try to avoid your Grimsby store as it has the dreaded toy car outside that makes our shopping trip a disaster (either not being allowed in it or having to leave it  my 19 month old usually get upset as we leave the store) but today he saw it on the way in... Cue refusing to sit in the trolley and full on toddler meltdown! I was stuck as would be the same problem getting in the car seat so managed to get him in the trolley and in the store. A shop assistant have a sympathetic smile then offered us some sweets (they were chewy and he d struggle to eat them... But clutched them anyway!) instead  he ran off and got an apple! Much to my little mans delight! Thank you tesco Grimsby! You made a little boy happy and a shopping trip much less painful 👍🏻					2016-07-01T18:19:07+0000	1467397147	2016-07-01 20:19:07	19	9	19	0	28	9	5	4	6	0	18	0	0	0	0	0	0

We bought a cabin bed in November for my son which subsequently broke leaving is needing to remove a panel last month. I wrote a review about the bed and a staff member contacted me asking what they could do to help. Not only did we get a full refund  tesco paid the £18 difference to exchange for another style of bed (as an apology for the inconvenience)  and it was arranged that the broken bed was collected the same day the new bed arrived. This minimised disruption for my four year old son. Thank you tesco for your amazing customer service. 👍					2016-07-01T17:11:15+0000	1467393075	2016-07-01 19:11:15	9	1	9	0	10	1	1	0	1	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well today my mum  visited Litherland Tesco. Were her shopping came to £29. When she proceeded to pay. My mums card was declined  no fault of her own. when it did the Check out assistant Humilated my mother telling everyone in the que  Shes got no money in her bank and laughed . Little did the Check out Assitant Know  There is money in the account. There is a problem with the card. What gives your checkout asstiant the right  to discriminate my mother like that?   As my mum had no cash on her and the bank card not working had no option but to return to her car and cry her eyes out  Do you think that is acceptble Tesco? its ok your checkout assistant must of thought so she had a great day  she had a laugh at someone elses expense.  After crying and the humilation wore off  My mum lodged a complaint  With your Customer service team over the phone. got to hand it to you  your Customer service team on the phone was secound to none. Amazing! and restored a little bit of faith back in to my mum.  But since doing our weekly shopping in tescos Litherland since it was opened. for my mum to be offered a mear £10 to say sorry is not going to cut it.   My mum is so embarassed to walk into litherland Tescos again. NO CUSTOMER SHOULD FEEL THAT WAY.  Work this out. £100 a week x 52weeks = £5200 year on average we spend at Litherland Tesco. i wonder if Asda  Iceland Foodss  or Aldi UK  Would like our money instead. Would you treat a customer like that ?					2016-07-01T15:30:19+0000	1467387019	2016-07-01 17:30:19	0	9	0	0	9	9	4	5	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They said they would replace it but I must return the faulty item within 30 days. Next day a replacement radio was delivered to my home together with  a free returns label. in Aug last year I purchased a Dashcam through Tesco Direct. Recently it started to give problem so I contacted the Tesco Customer Services and was told incorrectly that I should return it to the manufacturer for repair. Despite reminding them several times that my contract was with them and by Consumer Law they should organise repair/replacement I was firmly told it was not their responsibility. Luckily the manufacturer was helpful and to save further hassle I sent it to them at my cost of £4 50. Wonder which retailer I will use in future?					2016-07-01T15:20:54+0000	1467386454	2016-07-01 17:20:54	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a couple of dresses and a top (for choice) from F&F online on 16th June for an event on 18th.  Website clearly states next day delivery for click and collect but apparently  it can take up to 48 hours for Aberdeen  - of course  because we are sooo remote up here!  I was actually sitting at the event when I got the text and email saying the items had arrived so next day I toddle along to the store thinking that maybe I will keep them anyway  only to be told on arrival that the parcel is not there!  At that point I said just send it back when it turns up and I can get my money back.  I wrote a complaint and was contacted by someone very politely apologising and I felt a little better about the whole thing.  That was until yesterday when a message was left on my phone telling me my parcel is ready for collection!!  I tried to call back without success so I called the customer service line again - and was told that they will wait 14 days before returning items from the store.  So it wont be returned until tomorrow (or possibly Monday depending on when they ACTUALLY got the delivery) and the refund will be processed once the items are back with the warehouse.  So let me get this straight - Tesco have had my money since 16th June (I checked my bank balance) and I have had nothing??  Worse still  despite saying to send it back  they keep the parcel for 14 days and I wont see my refund for some time yet??  The only part of this whole process that was simple was the ordering and paying the money ... nothing has been as it should have been since I clicked confirm order!  Can t see me ever bothering with Tesco online again - or Tesco in general if this is  customer service .					2016-07-01T13:39:14+0000	1467380354	2016-07-01 15:39:14	4	9	4	1	14	9	7	2	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I order something yesterday (30th June)  to be delivered to a local store today (1st June). I then receive a text today telling me that you can t deliver it until tomorrow as there is high demand. A TEXT?! How disrespectful. The least you can do is phone your customers! You won t allow me to change address to deliver the item to. I needed that item TODAY!!! It is my father in laws birthday tomorrow and it was for him! He doesn t live local and doesn t have a Tesco direct near to him so I ordered it here! I m fuming! Your customer service is a shambles!!!!! I spoke to a supervisor even though I asked for a manager! Who answers the phone with  hello   Instead of the usual  tesco direct  or whatever. It s just plain rude! I will never be using you again!!!! First and last time! Absolute joke!!!!!!!!!!					2016-07-01T11:29:33+0000	1467372573	2016-07-01 13:29:33	1	35	1	0	36	35	5	30	11	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We  together with the queue of people behind us were kept waiting till a Supervisor came - after a second call - to check the notes.  Her idea of checking - walk a short distance away and hold up to the light!  I remember being treated like this 30 years ago - I thought we had moved on since then  obviously not.  If this is to be the norm why not supply your staff with a counterfeit detection pen and save everyone the stress  anger  embarrassment and negative comments on Facebook!!					2016-07-01T09:20:22+0000	1467364822	2016-07-01 11:20:22	3	4	4	0	8	4	3	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	1	0

Apparently there is new discounted stock making its way to the shelves  so I went to ask yesterday. The guy at the desk told me  I quote   yes mate  we have it on delivery but I am not allowed to sell it until tomorrow . So I went to the store this morning at 5 to 6 waiting for it to open. Then straight to the desk asking for that same product. The customer service agent checked for me but guess what - none in stock  none in delivery.   So it seems like the only ones to actually get the benefit of discount items are the tesco employees. Unacceptable.   Speaking about the Salford extra store. I m definitely not going to shop there again.					2016-07-01T06:06:10+0000	1467353170	2016-07-01 08:06:10	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The advert shows a water melon being changed for a pineapple. Do the FOOD  items being returned get put back on the shelf? My friends and i are quite concerned about the safety of this. Not being alarmist  but once removed from the shop  anyone could have done anything with them!					2016-07-01T05:47:15+0000	1467352035	2016-07-01 07:47:15	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
