The staff were there in an instant to help  they gave us an ice pack  they also gave my daughter a sticker book to keep her occuiped while the first aider had a look at her and then they even helped me out to my car.

I brought your tex mex mini dips selection today  thinking it would be safe to eat the salsa. However  upon inspection  it looked like the guacamole was also dairy free. The ingredients look they are split into individual dips as you have written avocado pur√©e in bold follows by contains. Under this there is no mention of milk. I therefore believed it to be safe  until someone pointed out the item description says it contains cream. Luckily I have only consumed a small amount so hoping my reaction won t be too nasty. However  why make the label so confusing? Either lump all the ingredients today or separate them by individual dips. Don t do a combination of the 2 as it makes it very hard to know what is safe	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15727039_10154283931035658_8639364400114602145_n.jpg?oh=4fbc177c5b668f0b55988d52cfafe9fd&oe=59208221	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15727039_10154283931035658_8639364400114602145_n.jpg?oh=d61f1b9aff5f6fefbf94f53bd018dca5&oe=58EDF32C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154283931035658&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-31T21:23:26+0000	1483219406	2016-12-31 22:23:26	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now  I feel that the clue is in the name and that this product should indeed  pop.  My 5 year old Son  hanging eagerly from the string of the first one  pulled....... and the string came off in his hand. The only  pop  evident was the sound of his little  hopeful heart breaking. We tried another 4 times and the same thing happened. At ¬£3.50 I was reluctant to purchase them anyway  being that they would simply be money  literally  burnt. But knowing that my children find them an integral part of New Year s Eve  I purchased them.   Tesco  I now fear that our midnight celebrations will be  damp  or at least premature as we will have to manually burst the party poppers and unravel the cheap paper insides ourselves.   I ve endured many a disappointing bang in my lifetime but now you re messing with my kids and I have to draw the line at that.   We will start prepping for midnight at 11:45 due to the terrible quality of your party poppers. I hope you can live with yourselves.   Unpopped  Gosport.					2016-12-31T20:37:25+0000	1483216645	2016-12-31 21:37:25	9	16	20	2	38	16	12	4	10	0	9	0	0	11	0	0	0

I went to Tesco in Hollington to get a large leg of lamb . Sold out so I got two lamb joints   as I was cooking for 15 people .. I cooked for the 2hours   uncovered and cooked for a further 30 minutes . While it was cooling   I prepared the rest of the meal . We started to calve the meat   which in actual fact was pure fat !!! There was no meat on either joints  just thick fat running through the whole joint . My partner had to rush back up Tesco and buy 2 cooked chickens . I d already made a lamb gravy with onion and red wine so we had to use that with chicken . Very very disappointed . Ended up paying ¬£24 for all the meat . And the chicken barely went round . I m only thankful that u were open for me to get more supplies . I will never buy your lamb joints again !					2016-12-31T18:01:41+0000	1483207301	2016-12-31 19:01:41	0	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	1	0

I would hate to experience what we just experienced!  Regards  A horrified customer!!!  .............. Please share!!   If you have these fireworks please DONT USE!!!!! Bought from Tesco.  To cut a long story short I don t like fireworks in gardens but decided not to spoil the boys fun. We bought these five went off ok. The 6th went straight up and then straight down and exploded on the floor of next doors garden.  The next one spilt and half hit the garden fence the the other exploded on the patio where I had been sitting with the boys.  Luckily I had taken them to watch from inside after number 6!!!!  Never again.

Word of warning: do not shop at Tesco more than once in a 24 hour period or the parking Cowboys will say you ve stayed all day!					2016-12-31T17:44:46+0000	1483206286	2016-12-31 18:44:46	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

But I m really not happy with the product itself. Especially given that it s such a recognised quality brand. Our mattress is only a couple of years old but I thought it would add a little extra comfort. Needless to say when we opened this to air it out and allow it to plump up  we were not impressed. I get that foam discolouration is fairly common but the fact that this is in the centre like someone has already used up its  better days  gives me no desire to put it anywhere near my mattress let alone sleep on it!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15740747_10154368770303635_5065619623577085407_n.jpg?oh=ce8b1fa95001d2901a764aa84c9dfe89&oe=58DA174E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15740747_10154368770303635_5065619623577085407_n.jpg?oh=f029d562a1b18d0ab85b2495d77a99c7&oe=58DC1043	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154368770303635&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-31T17:29:11+0000	1483205351	2016-12-31 18:29:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Thursday 22nd Dec I was rushing round doing my Xmas food shop (10pm) when I walked past a cage in one of the aisles. The cage ripped my brand new coat on the sleeve and I was gutted. I mentioned it to the staff member who was emptying the cage who told me to go and speak to customer service. Which I did  and was told straight away without hesitation that it would be sorted. I was advised to buy a replacement coat or bring the original receipt in  for my coat. I went away feeling annoyed and stressed as I had so much other stuff to do for Xmas. Anyway  today I received my replacement coat that I ordered on line and went into store to speak to customer service. Straight away they said told me that I would get the full amount that I paid for my replacement without hesitation.  Thankyou so much tesco... You have made me very happy x					2016-12-31T16:56:48+0000	1483203408	2016-12-31 17:56:48	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Wanted bread and potatoes mainly. Imagine my surprise to find that the only potable they had were baking potatoes or the tiny packs of Charlotte potatoes  or similar. No 2.5 kg bags of basic spuds. Asked the guy I found stacking potatoes  wasn t interested  just said they didn t have any. Found another guy who was more helpful who said that the order had been  messed up  and that they had ran out!  Fancy running out of a staple like potatoes! Tesco  you re a shambles! I could understand you running out of steak pies at this time of year  but potatoes?!  Needless to say I had to source them from somewhere else.

Huge credit to Caroline for trying everything she could to revive it but ultimately have had to rescan the whole shop - most frustrating  particularly with an over-tired toddler in tow. Surely the battery life on the handsets should be sufficient to complete an average shop  but apparently this is an all-too-common occurrence.

The added bonus it has a promotion  Free Child Entry  to Cadbury World  which I planned to do in 2017 with my children. I have just cut the vouchers out to keep them safe  and they were out of date in April 2016!!  Luckily the chocolate isnt out of date until April 2017  but still doesnt make me too happy that its probably been hanging around in a warehouse since last Christmas. Plus it is advertising an offer which was long out of date. I am all for preventing waste  but at the same time  many people could purchase them and be disappointed.

I have seen veg that had gone brown  so manky it had juice collecting in the wrapping and products on the shelves today which had a use by date of today !  This is totally unacceptable.  Also to add further insult to injury I have used scan and pay and every time I ve done it we have been Picked for a random check (so random it s us all the time ) and the staff don t care how they turn your trifle upside down üò°üò°üò°üò°happy new year Tesco because I am changing my retailer in 2017.  At least 3-4 other people I know also said how rubbish your veg has  been and they shop in different areas .					2016-12-31T16:13:47+0000	1483200827	2016-12-31 17:13:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For about 2 years I ve enjoyed the same meal once a week....   Tesco CHUNKY Breaded cod fillets. Pack of 4. 500g ¬£2.75  But oh tesco what a disappointment... Tesco breaded cod fillets. Pack of 4  500g ¬£2.00  So for the last 2 years you ve mugged me and my family off 75p a week. I buy what I think is the bigger product based on the fact it s apparently chunkier  so if it s the same weight how can you class it as  chunky  and charge almost another 40%?   That s about 75 quid wasted over the space of 2 years. Sure... Every little helps. I think not!!   We as consumers shouldn t have to check weights or prices on something that s advertised as bigger/chunkier. Shouldn t tesco try and make  every little help ??					2016-12-31T15:00:48+0000	1483196448	2016-12-31 16:00:48	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please see the attached photos. 6 easy steps to build and decorate your house. I would call myself a pro when it comes to DIY  I have built a few flat pack bedroom furniture items from the yellow and blue store famous for such goods  but recently bought this kit thinking I was ready. I was not.   Step 1  I soared through  warming the icing bag up in my hands. I really thought I was on to a winner  I was flying.   Step 2  I lay out the pieces  much like a flat pack side table  I counted the pieces twice to be sure. Everything was laid out.  I was ready  Step 3  like a pro I iced four neat lines into the tray in preparation for the construction of the house. Step 4 was much the same  I was grinning from ear to ear as I expertly iced the gingerbread structure.  Step 5  this is where I started to struggle  you stated that I needed to insert the back panel into the tray. This is when I suddenly noticed that the decorative gingerbread was too large for your tray. Imagine my horror  what was I supposed to do? I tried the other piece and had exactly the same problem. How was I supposed to construct the house when all the pieces didn t fit in the tray?!   I shamelessly took a bite from each of the corners (see pictures) in order for my house to fit in the construction tray. I can honestly say I haven t ever had to chomp on any of the bedside tables in order for the pieces to fit  why have you made a product I have had to modify? Are you trying to test me?   As you can see  from the moment I had to gnaw on the walls everything came tumbling down. My house looks like it s been involved in a Suarez bukkaie video.

Christmas is surely the time to make a giggle out of any situation! üòÇ					2016-12-31T12:12:33+0000	1483186353	2016-12-31 13:12:33	3	0	6	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	3	2	0	1	0	0	0

Either we have 3 each then there is one left over which is useless  or someone gets more than the other and that s not fair on either of us.   I can imagine this is only handy if you are a spinster who does a weekly shop and only eats one slice of bacon a day.   Either put 6 or 8 in I reckon.   Suppose I could just buy a pack of 14? More profit for you. I see what you did there.					2016-12-31T11:52:41+0000	1483185161	2016-12-31 12:52:41	2	5	3	0	8	5	4	1	2	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

The cost came to ¬£89.79. She had 2 full cards of saving stamps - so ¬£100 with which to pay. The young lad didn t know how to do it (? seasonal staff)  so asked for help from the girl behind. She explained how to do it but then said that if we used both cards we wouldn t get any change!  Due to a growing queue behind us we didn t feel that we could argue  so just handed one card over  along with ¬£34.50 of vouchers (which didn t need to be spent until November 2017) and then paid the difference (¬£4.71) in cash. I suggested going to customer service to check that the information about not getting change from unused stamps was correct but there was also a queue there. On 30/12/16  my mum went to the Widnes Extra store (her local store) and handed over the other card with ¬£50 of stamps on and was given change with no problem.  We are both annoyed that we had to use ¬£34.50 of vouchers and cash that we didn t need to use. Can you confirm who was correct - the staff in the St Helens store or the staff in the Widnes store and maybe ensure that ALL staff in ALL stores are aware of the correct protocol too?					2016-12-31T11:44:04+0000	1483184644	2016-12-31 12:44:04	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I stood with the front door open  waiting from 8.55-10.30pm. I call Tesco  lovely man advises me that driver couldn t find the house and couldn t get through via telephone (did 1471 on house phone  was a call days ago but nothing today at all- mobile  no missed calls at all) but that the driver will redeliver tomorrow AM with a few extra goodies thrown in as compensation  and be rest assured there are NO substitutions. (I asked to be called prior to delivery if there were to be). Fast forward to this morning - my order arrives AFTER the agreed revised time slot with numerous substitutions namely most of my family sized desserts for New Years Day family gathering....instead I m sent 20 (yes 20!!!!) INDIVIDUAL cream cakes!!!?? in replacement for large family sized desserts. To add insult to the injury there was nothing extra thrown into the order as promised.  My driver this morning was lovely  said would refund for all food substitutes and that I could keep the cakes üò≥.... I ve just called customer services and been offered a ¬£10 voucher for the inconvenience?! I ve now got to take all my children food shopping to find desserts- ¬£10 won t even cover the fuel I ll use  let alone compensate for miserable children and the stress!!

I dropped my basket and ran around the aisles I‚Äôd been to see if I had mislaid it etc. It wasn‚Äôt there. I started to really panic and get quite upset as the next bag had ¬£70 worth of baby outfits inside. I‚Äôd only bought them 20 minutes previous. I ran to the customer services desk  where they told me no (and without any obvious empathy either) I asked the security men who were standing by the door  at the CCTV cameras  if anyone had handed to them. They said no. I said would there be any way they could quickly check past 5 minutes of cctv incase the bag and potential thief were still in the store. They told me no and that I would have to come back tomorrow?! (Helpful). I  again  ran around all the aisles. At this point  I was actually crying with panic because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford to buy these presents again. I asked a few employees again if anything had been handed in. They all said no... One actually said ‚Äònaw hen  it‚Äôs probably been lifted!‚Äô‚Ä¶ Not very helpful and frankly quite upsetting.      I stood at the door. Revisited the customer service desk and the various other desks (opticians etc.) a couple more times before I eventually gave up and left to go home. On the way home  I remembered an area I hadn‚Äôt revisited. I tried calling customer services to see if there would be any way they could check the specific area for me  as I don‚Äôt live near this particular Tesco. I got through to a call centre. They told me to drive back if I wanted to check it. (Wish I‚Äôd have thought of that myself Mrs Brains!?!)  From that point on  I got the local customer services number and proceeded to call the desk 13 times in total over a 6 hour period. They either never answered or hung up when they heard my voice. I spoke to one lady from these 13 attempts who seemed to be the only helpful employee in the whole store. She did check the area for me- unfortunately the bag wasn‚Äôt there either.     I returned to the store the following day to query the CCTV. The gentleman phoned his colleague to come down to the main entrance where my partner & I were waiting. I told him the exact time I entered the store  what I was wearing  what bags I was holding and told him the first place I headed for. He left and told me to come back in 15 minutes once he‚Äôd looked at the playback. When he returned  the gentleman said these exact words ‚ÄòYes I can see you on the camera. You came in with the bag and left without it‚Äô‚Ä¶..    He‚Äôd spent 15/20 apparently looking at CCTV... to tell me that? Useless information that I quite obviously KNEW. He then proceeded to lie to me... ‚ÄòWhen you came in  you veered over to the right and I didn‚Äôt catch where you went after that‚Äô... I replied ‚ÄòNo  I didn‚Äôt go over to the right at all? I went straight ahead. I went straight for the wrapping paper?‚Äô He replied ‚ÄòNo cos I seen you and your boyfriend go that way?‚Äô‚Ä¶    My boyfriend hadn‚Äôt been with me.       I am a retail manager. I regularly watch CCTV. I asked him had he not followed my route? Had it been the other way around... I would have followed a customer in segments to see at what point the bag wasn‚Äôt on their person anymore... Not only could I narrow it down and save myself time... but I also then be able to inform the customer of where & when exactly the bag was taken. I told him this. I wrote down my full route of the store and asked him to look at it for me. He said it would take him couple of hours... I reluctantly agreed that he could just call me instead. He said he‚Äôd phone me that night once he could confirm what the fate of the bag was. After this  I began to wonder how he‚Äôd seen me leave without my shopping bag if he hadn‚Äôt followed my route? Probably another lie...     That was the 19th December. It‚Äôs now the 31st. I‚Äôve never received that call back.   As a retail manager  I am genuinely appalled at this level of customer service. To show no empathy to a young girl who is visibly upset is bad enough. To ignore calls  hang up on customers  lie to their face and never give them the call back promised to them is horrific.   To make matters worse  I‚Äôve since been informed by an employee of the next store that I also revisited  that Tesco Silverburn are hopeless at helping people in circumstances like this. That is awful. I will never step foot in your store again. I know Tesco won‚Äôt care that 1 person  a number like me won‚Äôt shop there again... but hopefully people reading this never have to rely on the staff of the Tesco Silverburn store ever again. They are useless and quite clearly have no regard for their customers and their customers‚Äô possessions.					2016-12-31T10:44:45+0000	1483181085	2016-12-31 11:44:45	6	5	11	8	24	5	3	2	3	0	5	0	0	0	0	5	0

Today I visited your superstore in Kidderminster all I wanted was 150 bread rolls....not a lot really but as I was happily filling my trolley up with your bread rolls I was approached by a store worker who had a very disgusted look on his face at me and then he started talking....in the most disrespectful manner possible telling me that I should have ordered the rolls (yes maybe I should have if I could get thro to somebody) and that he is now going to have to deal with angry people because I took all the bread rolls!!even tho there s a bakery inside this tescos!surely if I want to go into a Tesco superstore and buy 150 rolls off the shelf I should be aloud to with out being made to feel like I ve done the worst thing in the world by someone who has the mannerisms of an angry goat!					2016-12-31T10:29:21+0000	1483180161	2016-12-31 11:29:21	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m really disgusted at your attempt to mill me and my children. Whilst travelling on your travellator from the top floor back to the first floor  I received a mains electrical shock to my left ring finger. The shock was large enough to cause my forearm muscles to contract. I am an electronics engineer and I am well aware of the difference between static discharge and a mains electrical discharge. I immediately held my children away from the sides. And contacted a member of staff to ensure they shut off the power supply immediately. This didnt happen. They tried to fob me off with a static story until eventually I insisted the store manager attend. When she did I told her in the interest of public safety it needed to be turned off until an electrical safety check could be carried out. Unbelievably she said she would need to check with the area manager!!!!!!!   What if this had been a child? What if the next time it stops someone s heart? This is an  appalling health and safety attitude!!!!!  Please please get the travellator shut off and get it checked!!!!!!					2016-12-31T09:35:18+0000	1483176918	2016-12-31 10:35:18	1	11	5	4	20	10	6	4	4	0	1	0	2	0	0	2	0

The car on the left parked next to ours this morning as we visited your Stretford Store with absolutely no clue how to park within a bay which made it difficult to put my 2 year old in her car seat due to lack of space I may as well have parked in a normal bay by a wall I would have had more room! Not something I should have to worry about when using parent and baby bays. Perhaps someone should monitor this?

We have just bought your  Finest  Sticky toffee pudding  as a treat  because we are ill  and going to miss out on a lovely new years celebration with friends... Only to get it home and discover that you can ONLY cook it in the microwave. Since when was sticky toffee pudding  not suitable for oven heating ??? Mostly since you packaged it in plasticised cardboard as far as I can tell... I am not sure that anything that was the  Finest  of it s ilk has ever been cooked in a microwave. And so don t own one... Never had this problem at Sainsbury s... Or Waitrose.					2016-12-30T22:42:01+0000	1483137721	2016-12-30 23:42:01	2	24	3	0	27	24	7	17	12	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

It s the worst shopping experience in the Island - small isles which are crowded with shoppers and staff stacking shelves which leads to tempers frayed. Not forgetting the lack of choice or limited items on the shelf! Completely different to Inverness - yes because it s bigger!! Also the carpark spaces have been squeezed together again leading to scrapes/dents on cars!! The only plus are the helpful staff! Co-op Stornoway wins hands down. I look forward to hearing from you.					2016-12-30T22:29:59+0000	1483136999	2016-12-30 23:29:59	10	7	10	1	18	7	3	4	4	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was visiting your branch in the East London and I was delighted to pick up a 48 box of the finest Jaffa Cakes a person could buy. Upon returning to my residence I reviewed the receipt to check ones finances were in order and what I discovered was a grotesque misrepresentation of this fine delicacy. The Bill showed that Jaffa Cakes were poorly mislabeled as  biscuits  which we all know to be incorrect. If you could please remediate this as a matter of emergency it would be greatly appreciated.

Why is this? I didn t realise there was a cut off for buying video games in a 24hr store? I had rang up customer services before travelling to the store to check stock & was told the game I wanted was in stock but no mention of not being able to buy games after 2000. When I have bought anything from the entertainment/electrical desk from any other supermarket later in the day I have never encountered this issue.					2016-12-30T20:57:16+0000	1483131436	2016-12-30 21:57:16	1	9	1	0	10	9	3	6	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The phone rang for a good couple of minutes and I got put through to customer service in Wales!. I spoke to an agent who also tried the store and couldn t get through. I then had to go through filling in a form to describe my debit card and was told that they hoped to have an answer in an hour. Wales to Scotland in an hour? I told the agent I would make my way to the store myself. Why can t they just answer the phone at my local store?

He returned a Lego yesterday as he had received it twice for Christmas. He was told it would be easy to exchange if we found something for the same value or more. He excitedly (after 25mins consideration) selected three boxes of Lego for the similar value. We went to the customer services desk to exchange and was told one item was not on the system. The sales assistant then said they would not be able to sell him the Lego. I asked if they could find the price or a manger to help  to which we were told to select another item. I am unsure why there would be products on your shelf which you cannot sell. My son was very disappointed he could not have the Lego he so wanted. I am very disappointed at the level of assistance offered by the staff. I look forward to your response.					2016-12-30T20:11:07+0000	1483128667	2016-12-30 21:11:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No fresh cream no multi pack dips.  I asked a customer assistant if there was any through the back   No was the response. The delivery comes in first thing in the morning I was told  dissapointing considering the size of the shop!!  I travelled to my local store in boness where I was able to get cream. One of the customer assistant checked his  inform app  he was able to tell me the nearest shop with stock was Redding road with approx 118 in stock!!    Very dissapointing service from Redding road maybe retraining needed!!   Boness are getting one of their managers to pick me up a packet of dip from Linlithgow.  Excellent service from boness!!   Maybe a lesson to be learned in customer care for Redding road.					2016-12-30T19:59:10+0000	1483127950	2016-12-30 20:59:10	8	33	10	0	43	33	15	18	48	0	8	1	0	0	0	0	0

I have just returned home after purchasing this at your Doncaster Edenthorpe branch. Will be taking it back tomorrow obviously. Have already spoken to customer services and the store manager but apart from being offered a ¬£6 refund they were not very forthcoming about what they were actually going to do to resolve it and prevent it happening again. 12 days out of date is not acceptable at all. This is the second time it has happened at this store within the last 3 months. My partner and I could have ended up in hospital with food poisoning. Kind Regards. Simon Holmes.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15726342_10154690819810609_8174997752171776439_n.jpg?oh=1fbf59e0f74902412187efd2a46da19a&oe=58D7BAC2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15726342_10154690819810609_8174997752171776439_n.jpg?oh=012ea81ab2158d987791d1aecbe67d1e&oe=58DE47CF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154690819810609&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-30T19:33:35+0000	1483126415	2016-12-30 20:33:35	11	27	30	1	58	26	17	9	20	0	11	0	13	0	0	6	0

When  I unpacked the shopping I noticed the loaf has actually gone past it s sell by date...by 10 days! I spent ¬£3 on it today (30th December) when it went out of date on the 20th. I am disgusted and as I don t live near have no quick solution to the problem. I have tried to contact you via the phone with limited success.  I was told to call another number with no response.

Unfortunately they were clearly three days out of date WHEN I BOUGHT them. They surely shouldn t have been on the shelves?! Luckily the smell of them when I opened them made me check before I tried to use them to make sausage rolls. Not impressed. Picture shows highlighted sausages and date and time bought. The other pack were in date until the 31st. Bought at Hemsworth store.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15698173_10154243079147473_7243388739682692486_n.jpg?oh=79d3695b77c271769d34fd289a84faa6&oe=58E7046B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15698173_10154243079147473_7243388739682692486_n.jpg?oh=ecba580a1c30a79936c221589034ebc3&oe=5921C166	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154243079147473&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-30T16:43:04+0000	1483116184	2016-12-30 17:43:04	2	2	5	0	7	2	2	0	1	0	2	0	2	0	0	1	0

I  myself didn t have to endure this truly horrific  glittery experience..I can only imagine the true extent of these truly dreadful experiences. I really need to try this horrific experience for myself next year and I m therefore pleading with you to please consider producing this wrapping paper again next year as I NEED to have my Christmas ruined...(By the way  I must praise you on the good manners of your online staff. I had major problems with some wrinkled up sausages that didn t look right..They were slightly short and a bit wonky...I was deeply disturbed by this. The particular member of staff I had correspondence with was extremely understanding and calmed me down  he made me realise that my life was worth living after this traumatic sausage event. I can now move forwards and have no recurring nightmares).  Thanks Tesco....üëçüëç					2016-12-30T14:38:54+0000	1483108734	2016-12-30 15:38:54	4	3	7	0	10	3	3	0	1	0	4	0	0	3	0	0	0

On numeorus occasions they have snapped at customers for asking on issues why actual prices are different than display prices. I and my mother are regular customers  here for more than 6 years and previously we are customers at tesco kajang. Further necessities like sugar or salt or vegetables if out stocks are not stocked promptly. The cashiers or staffs loosely will address most female customers as aunty.They refer my mother who is in her mid 60s as aunty and I in mid 30s as aunty.What is the actual meaning of aunty? Does cashiers and staffs at UK Tesco refer to their female customers as aunty? Why in the earth they make us as their relatives? And today when I asked a temporary cashier at counter 17 around 7.30 pm  why she addressed me as aunty  she replied thats what they were trained to call customers like that. She didn t even apologise for wrong use of language.When I correct her that she is in customer service line and she should address customers promptly like sir  madam or ms (in malay cik or encik).Mind you I was not shouting or scolding at her.However she snapped and started to throw the items I have purchased  after  she finished scanning prices and when I asked her to stop doing that she didnt bother to apologise or stop. She continued to throw my credit card and receipt. I immediately I told I will lodge a complaint against her  she just said thank you very much. I can t bother to complaint there as previously other rude incident took place in front of the line leader or supervisor but he didnt bother.Disappointed with bad customer service.					2016-12-30T14:26:11+0000	1483107971	2016-12-30 15:26:11	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is irrelevant as we all know the health hazards of smoking despite the price rises too and other actions taken. I hope as many smokers will give up this habit which will save not only money but most importantly their life. I hope this will be one of their new year s resolutions.

A word of advice to the complainers  run ur nail over the tape wen u apply it...this youll find has wondrous magical properties and allows it to stick to the paper (could be that it jus needs a bit of extra pressure but ppl like magic). I may also suggest that a hoover should of been on your Christmas list if you re 1 of the many complaining you couldn t lift the glitter from your carpet. (My hoover is 3 years old and held together with tape...no problem) Tesco have have a sale on and you just might get a bargain hoover.

I found this out to my cost:( I placed my order approx. 9 days before Christmas and on Christmas eve morning my delivery came without above! Thankfully I had an early delivery and could rush out to get the missing items. On raising this issue with Tesco I received an apology for the inconvenience caused .... great! Surely it is not too difficult to put in place processes to guarantee that customers who place online orders early get key Christmas items...... I will certainly not be relying on Tesco s again and if you want anything other than a fresh Turkey you might also want to have a plan B!!!!					2016-12-30T12:13:53+0000	1483100033	2016-12-30 13:13:53	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You d have thought people would be grateful and happy  then be even happier that Christmas had an extra bit of glitter sparkle ‚ú® I find it shocking that all some people do is complain  glitter? Really? Meanwhile all around the world people are suffering real issues. People in Nigeria are living in fear for their lives of Boko Haram. Millions of people from the Middle East are homeless  hungry  relying on donations of food and drink. They re living in overcrowded refugee camps   forced out of their homes by IS. People around the world are starving and living in poverty. They re just a few real (mainstream) problems people are living with right now.  It s glitter for goodness sake  why can t people just be grateful that that s the biggest problem they have right now.

People seem to enjoy complaining. Its a hobby for some I guess.    Get a life  if you dont want a glittery house then don t buy glittery wrapping paper it is as simple as that.  No common sense what so ever in some people. A quick once over with the hoover did the trick.  (Did need extra tape to stick  but I expected that so bought more.)   I loved the glittery paper & even got the matching glittery cards & bags.

You can t expect to buy it and not have glitter on your floors. You all knew what you were buying there s no hidden catch its glitter üòÇüòÇ as for people saying tape wouldn t stick to it. Ill be entirely honest  Tesco sold this paper last year i bought it 2 years in a row. I ve had no problem sticking tape to it.

It was gorgeous  granted my double sided sticky tape or sellotape struggled to keep it together but all of the presents looked gorgeous and my husband wrapped all my gifts in the paper I bought from u which made me very happy. Even got some rolls left for next year. You can never never have too much glitter ‚ú® that s what xmas is all about!!! Everyone else needs to consider buying a real hoover like a dyson or giving up they re negative xmas energy for a new yrs resolution. Sell it again next year!!					2016-12-30T10:22:33+0000	1483093353	2016-12-30 11:22:33	6	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

My first delivery had the following missing item...shower gel! I have said that I will take substitutes but it said no substitute available!!! Am I dealing with a corner shop here? I really can t imagine no shower gel on your shelves. I didn t bother to complain at the time just thought a minor fault. Let s go on to the second delivery  on taking out the fridge bag I could see it wasn t mine! The young deli very man went to phone his team leader  returning to me he said I had two options  either money credited or goods redelivered the next day  which I think was the Saturday. This was the option I chose  he was unable to give me a time slot  but after staying in all day there was no delivery. I then phoned the customer service in Wales  they tried to get in touch with my Southampton but for whatever reason were unable to have a conversation with them. At this stage I elected to take a refund for the goods. Later in the week I did receive a telephone call from yourselves apologising and offering me a ¬£10 voucher off me next delivery  which I accepted. She did say that after asking team leaders they said that they had not had a call from the delivery man!  My next couple of deliveries were okay.....now we come to my delivery of yesterday. I was away for Christmas so this order was covering a meal for company yesterday but what should be missing...my pork leg joint!!!! and a picking fault  the security tag on a bottle of whisky. After about 5 minutes of trying to remove tag by the delivery man we had to admit defeat  he did say I could send it back but seeing how I needed it for my guest that was not an option. I phoned customer service again who contacted Southampton who duly phoned me. This phone call was not helpful and I was given the option to go into store and pick a joint  of which on consulting your sight were plentiful! including the one that I had chosen.  To make things worse I have prepaid for 12 months delivery because as you can imagine I am not very happy with your deliveries .

I would like to thank Tesco and its staff this year for all their hard work. Everything was fresh  had everything I needed and the staff were really helpful. The prices were kept well within an affordable ranges and lastly it was great to be served by a smiling face. I watched the staff on the floor running around making sure everything was stocked up and well presented. I hope you all had a very Mery Christmas.

Having ordered a wooden kitchen for our niece for Christmas  it arrived in good time and was set aside for the big day. Upon opening the gift  it was found that one of the plastic panels had a severe crack in it  rendering the item dangerous and unusable. Having travelled over 2hrs to drop the gift off in the first place  we explained to your call centre staff member that we were unable to exchange the item in store and that they were welcome to collect. Having agreed to send a replacement out to our local store  we asked if there was anything else that could be done  as in addition to having a very upset little girl on Christmas morning  who had waited months for her desired present  we would now have to take another trip  over 2hrs in order to deliver it to her and the magic of the present being from Santa had been lost. This has not only inconvenience us  in that we both work full time and the delivery of this gift to our niece would now be very much delayed  but it is also  obviously  very difficult to explain to a very young child that her gift will not be with her for another lengthy period. Having explained this to your staff member  he merely laughed at my partner over the phone  which is not only poor customer service  but extremely rude behaviour and as a result we will definitely be thinking long and hard before we shop with you again. Having worked for you ourselves  in management positions previous to our current employment  we were unaware that your customer service training had altered so greatly  or been omitted altogether!					2016-12-30T09:07:05+0000	1483088825	2016-12-30 10:07:05	14	2	14	3	19	2	2	0	5	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

HaHa :-) oops yes I did get glitter over the carpet when I wrapped the presents! And yes I did comment to my work colleagues I was covered in glitter  yes the cello tape didn t stick very well so I used more and pushed harder! But it was super cute and I loved it. Oops and then son opened presents on Christmas Day  and glitter got over the sofa and the rug and us! But first time I ve had the Hoover out on Christmas Day for a while! :-) it s was all good and super super cute!!

My sister and I purchased this wrapping paper and both were covered in glitter (she wrapped on her bed!) my wrapping paper  was from Santa to my little one. I have to say my sellotape stuck just fine and yes the glitter came off but loads was still on this beautiful paper and the reindeer was super cute. Don t be disheartened dear Tesco some of us see the funny side to glitter covered everything (  tis the season) and loved your paper.

When I got home I noticed it was out of date! The sticker had been ripped and folded over at the date. I had to throw it away as it was inconvenient for me to return to store and have something else.

I fully expected it to shed glitter but that s the beauty of having laminate and a sweeping brush lol. I loved your paper and would definitely buy it again. The paper was fab quality due to its thickness  easy to cut and didn t tear. I looked like the Christmas tree by the time I d finished but guess what...it s Christmas and I love sparkle. I m used to my house looking like a glitter bomb has just been detonated as I have a 5 year old daughter who loves arts and crafts especially when it s anything to do with glitter. I still have some of the paper left and I m keeping it for next year. Thank you Tesco üòÑ					2016-12-30T06:55:41+0000	1483080941	2016-12-30 07:55:41	9	2	9	0	11	2	2	0	0	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just got back from your Shrewsbury store after taking my poorly 22 month old son with me to buy Calpol after dropping a bottle at home as I was about to give him some. My son has slept all day due to a chest infection & when he woke late tonight needing calpol & I stupidly dropped the bottle I had no choice but to take him with me!! Whilst walking around the store Jack wanted to go down so I let him walk with me & after I put him down a member of your staff who was stacking the shelves quite literally looked down at my son  held eye contact with me then tutted and walked away shaking his head at me!! I felt so belittled & as if i was a  bad parent for having my son out late. It isn t something I make a habit of & I m sure im not the first parent to have to take their child out late for medicine. Unfortunately I don t have anyone else at home or I wouldn t have had to take him with me. Maybe you need to be better educating your staff instead of letting them make your paying customers feel so small! To most it s not a big deal but I genuinely felt like I had done something wrong & immediately went to pay and leave!!  So upset!					2016-12-30T01:30:23+0000	1483061423	2016-12-30 02:30:23	0	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	4	0

Nothing wrong with glitter and I had no problem cleaning it up. Your wrapping paper is the prettiest around and I buy it every year ! I have small children and it didn t kill them lol. I ll be buying it next year too. Cellotape a tad hard to stick but only on weird shaped presents lol.

I knew it would lose some glitter as that was apparent as soon as I looked at it ! I did consider this but it didn t stop me from buying it. I had no problem wrapping and getting sellotape to stick to it either. Everyone commented on how expensive and pretty the paper looked and for this reason I would buy it again.

Well  I bought it too. I also have a house full of glitter. But what the heck  it s Christmas  It s what you expect. We also had fun wrapping the presents with it  true  sellotape doesn t stick to it  gaffer tape made a passable substitute when you rolled it up and used it invisibly under the folds and then wrapped lots of decorative string really tightly around the parcel to hold it  but my partner found the best thing to hold it was surgical tape  sticks to anything! Thank you Tesco for a sparkling and entertaining Christmas! :-) :-) :-) NB: Have had to quarantine the dog in the kitchen where the tile floor keeps the glitter under control  he can t stop sneezing in the rest of the house.					2016-12-29T23:47:52+0000	1483055272	2016-12-30 00:47:52	6	0	6	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a question in relation to your serving guide on products. I ordered the rib of beef that was in your Christmas food booklet which I was advised would feed a minimum of 8 people at ¬£44 nearly ¬£45. I did question that I would definitely have enough to feed 8 as I know from buying your birthday cakes that your servings suggested amount is very off key as a 8 inch cake to feed 25 people I suppose if you was feeding dwarfs yes but not human people in this day and age. Well I was assured that it would easily feed 8. When I picked my beef up on Christmas Eve I was so glad that I d also got a gammon joint and turkey for Boxing Day that I could use for Christmas Day as there was no way in the world the piece of beef I received and paid well over the price for would feed 8! Now I buy my rib of beef from your butchers counter most weeks and for a decent sized 3 rib of beef I pay a little less than that at around ¬£35 to ¬£38 which is enough to feed 5 maybe 6 people. So I am asking you to look at the picture attached to this post and advise me how on gods earth would this piece of beef feed 8 people!! Attaching a front view in comments also. I await your reply.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15726661_10158120260150151_1559542023062022270_n.jpg?oh=9d71b47e29f163b7c042f1507afa526e&oe=58E4B1EA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15726661_10158120260150151_1559542023062022270_n.jpg?oh=46a4c0c871bb21b8d6d094b1cca97e74&oe=58E5DCE7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158120260150151&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-29T22:29:03+0000	1483050543	2016-12-29 23:29:03	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I  just wanted to say yes it dropped glitter everywhere but so what it s Christmas! It required more sellotape to stick due to the glitter big deal. The end results looked fantastic! I bought this design last year and the new style reindeer this year  I will still be looking out for it again!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15781312_10155059823717590_5288307306365044603_n.jpg?oh=b2914297193663f07c64307997ac1a11&oe=58DB7B1B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15781312_10155059823717590_5288307306365044603_n.jpg?oh=a3743b35c0657934bf4b51b481875bee&oe=58DB6716	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155059823717590&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-29T22:07:54+0000	1483049274	2016-12-29 23:07:54	39	5	39	0	44	4	4	0	3	0	38	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called your customer care line this morning to enquire as to a more specific ETA to be told that the order had been cancelled at 10am THIS MORNING due to a supplier issue....bearing in mind this was a product listed as supplied by yourself not a 3rd party like many other products in your website. How a product can go from being ready to be dispatched to not being there at all is beyond me  as is the fact no-one from Tesco contacted myself to tell me it was not coming! I asked for Your help in locating another one from yourselves or your suppliers to be told you don t have to do that  go source one myself!

Mistake No.1! They really looked the part in the cellophane until you dared to open them.... Definitely Mistake No.2 üôà  I was sat in a bath of glitter  I thought I was daydreaming and sat on the beach in the sand until I heard the Welsh rain and wind and boy did it bring me back with a glitter bump! I then found it had an allergy to cellotape  so it kinda defeated the  wrapping paper  objective  and took 3 times longer to wrap  or rather tape up in a hot mess ..... Mistake No. 3  I so wish I learned at Mistake 1 üò®! I then had to apologise to my gift recipients in advance of handing the glitter bomb presents over  knowing fully I was sending their homes into one big glitter party  and whilst it s Christmas and sharing is caring  I think this was a glitter too much!  Soooooo being in the Christmas spirit  are you going to send the magic Christmas elves out to clean up this glitter mess??

To crown it all  the assistant  somewhat exasperated  took the batteries from me AND PROMPTLY THREW THEM IN THE BIN UNDER THE DESK!!!! How irresponsible.

A blonde lady member of staff helped me trying to find some. She checked all the shelves and was so helpful. In the end she suggested customer service to check stock in case some somewhere. As I walked away I heard her shout and came running up to me with a box of bay leaves. We had a big hug and everyone around us smiled. It was like  Love Actually ! I felt Christmas in that moment. Then to get to the check out and realise I forgot the cheese and crackers so the lovely lady at the checkout says  don t worry-you get what you need . I came back to find she had emptied my trolley for me and my put all my shopping on conveyor belt. What an amazing staff. Thankyou. Wish I had got their names. It was around 11am Xmas eve.					2016-12-29T19:41:55+0000	1483040515	2016-12-29 20:41:55	4	0	5	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	4	1	0	0	0	0	0

Today I visited my local branch  Swan Centre) and used scan and shop. Myself and my 3 year old enjoy doing this  and she had a very special treat she was allowed to buy ¬£15 of toys. A massive treat!  So we found a LOVELY Pink cat with sparkly eyes  it didn t scan  and said that it was not on the stock file and see the staff at the till. My daughter  needless to say  was EXTREMELY excited  a pink cat that even had glittery eyes  what more could a 3 year old want?  We got to the till  scanned and it asked if something wouldn t scan  so hit yes. The slightly helpful man  sauntered over  took the teddy that my daughter was excited about  couple of minutes later  sorry madam you can t buy this  it s not on file  it s a Health and Safety issue .... Sorry what? A health and safety issue  are you taking the mick??? A pink cat teddy  what s it gonna do? Throat slam me as I put it in the car? So I calmly ask  sooooo  the toys faulty  and on your shelves? ‚Äú his baffled response   no its just a health and safety issue .  My now upset 3 year old  had to watch the pink cat  be taken  and put in the basket of no return. So now I have a distraught child  no flipping pink cat with glittery eyes  and tears as she sat in the car with nothing to hug.  Please don t stock your shelves with toys that can not be sold  and definitely don t teach your staff that just because something isn t on stock file  that they should tell customers it s a Health and safety issue. My daughter  crying in the back of the car however is a health and safety issue.  Thanks Tesco for spoiling our special treat.					2016-12-29T18:52:13+0000	1483037533	2016-12-29 19:52:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Totally inedible! The bun was hard and crunchy and the inside were burnt. We were really looking forward to them!  Luckily we only used half the packet  turns out they need 40seconds on 80% power! That can t be right Tesco!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15698021_10100165291089908_2219163471677377376_n.jpg?oh=085154fe4c3bd23030c9ea50d35ff754&oe=5918D4B3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15698021_10100165291089908_2219163471677377376_n.jpg?oh=627e7f8c77a60f19863218ef01fe2dfe&oe=58E04DBE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100165291089908&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-29T18:51:35+0000	1483037495	2016-12-29 19:51:35	1	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	5	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

My husband returned it this afternoon and was just given a refund and another ¬£1.40  complete joke! Isn t it illegal to be selling out of date food?

The word PARTNER tells me you are in business together. Expected delivery was between 12 and 16 Dec. I rang PARTNER when it didn t arrive on 19th and was told they didnt know when it was sent but to wait 2 weeks as they send SECOND class and the website should not say delivery by 16th. I rang Tesco Direct who apologised and said it wasn t good enough and that I should have received it by the date promised online. I was again asked to wait 2 weeks. 2 weeks was up on 25 Dec so I had to wait until after bank holiday. Today I put in a claim online to then be told to wait ANOTHER 7 days!!!!! I rang Tesco Direct to be spoken to by a snotty man with an attitude to be told  Nothing Tesco can do its nothing to do with Tescos . WHAT???? I bought it from Tescos Website! I have to wait even further for a refund???? Thats disgusting! I was lulled in to a false sense of security by the word Tesco PARTNER. I believed you were in business together.

First of all I d like to say I m very Tesco loyal for nearly all things and shop at your great harwood  Accrington or burnley branches quite frequently and always find it an enjoyable experience. The staff are usually wonderful and I find your products excellent in value for money and quality.  I visited great harwood store about half an hour ago. I didn t really want to go today as our 14 month old son has just had his inoculations not an hour before and cried his heart out which broke mine. And now he s a very upset and grumpy little man. But I realised that we re desperately low on some things after Christmas and needs must so I popped in on my way home... I picked up a packet of petit filous which are Alfie s favourites along with some other bits and have just got home to find they re 2 days out of date!!! They weren t on the reduced section (just the normal yoghurt shelves)  I understand that Christmas is a busy and stressful time for retail and that some things slip under the radar and yes  I should ve checked the dates before putting them in my trolley but I m equally busy and stressed dealing with a whingy clingy toddler that I just wanted to get home to put down for a nap so he d feel a bit better.  I can t get him up to return said product and I d rather not have to leave the house again with him with his temperature up and him being so grumpy. So they ll be going in the bin.   Just wanted to let you know in case anyone else picks up a packet that has obviously been overlooked...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15780809_10154401137463710_5729711627173548790_n.jpg?oh=f26e12727f21fd6128a93f61d01bee7d&oe=59213449	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15780809_10154401137463710_5729711627173548790_n.jpg?oh=58fa62890ed05798bc71c3b9c8f83601&oe=58E35F44	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154401137463710&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-29T14:21:35+0000	1483021295	2016-12-29 15:21:35	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Could you please let me know why I spent over ¬£20 on a turkey crown which is supposed to be breast meat with just one bone and the turkey crown I received was far from this.

Unfortunately when she opened it it would not turn on  we then charged it for 2hrs and still nothing appeared on the screen to say it was charging or even to just turn on. The whole of Christmas day was ruined for her as she didnt get much else to play with and she was very upset thinking how  Santa  would be able to fix it and he might not be able to do anything. I reassured her I would go and buy her a new ipod and she even offered to give me her ¬£35 she recieved from others for Christmas to help with the cost.   I sent an email to the CEO straight away but still havent got a reply!   Now I decide to take it back to Tesco Peterborough and ask for an exchange as it was faulty  but the lady who served me (Jane) asked for my card  I found that strange as it was just an exchange and as I went to put my card in the machine I said to her I wanted an exchange but she just said  the money will go back onto your account within 3-5working days  I then said that I never wanted a refund and I asked for an exchange  she got funny with me and said I never said that. I was more cross that I only had ¬£250 in my account and that was going on bills and that I promised my daughter I would get a new ipod and now because of this womans mistake I would either have to wait a few days to recieve the money back to purchase a new 1 and let my daughter down once again  or buy her a new 1 and me struggle for a few days.   This is probably going to be my daughters last year of believing in Santa and her day was ruined because of the faulty product I purchased from Tesco.   All they could offer me was ¬£20 fuel costs for the inconvenience! In my opinion it was not good enough for the mistake a collegue had made and also had an attitude who offered no help and also still having no reply from the CEO regarding my email of complaint!   I will be emailing the CEO again.  Elisa Conte					2016-12-29T13:26:46+0000	1483018006	2016-12-29 14:26:46	0	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	3	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0

Checked the site  guess what  no slots available even tomorrow. So now got friends coming and no shopping in as I ve ordered a great big shop from the store that won t even  help  me a little bit despite it being their fault.

When we were about to leave we realised we only had ¬£10 so went back to the till and asked if one of the ¬£20 had stuck to the other and they said they wouldn t be able to tell us till 8pm that night when they cash up but would ring me the following morning to let us know. We haven t heard anything and customer services were no help. I have sent an email but still nothing.  This is my sons Christmas and bday savings and Is really important that it s taken seriously and the money is not just pocketed. Hoping to hear something really soon.

We ve just been shopping at your Park Farm store in Ashford  Kent.  Myself  my wife along with our 2 year old and 11 week old had to do a big shop and it ended up being a bigger shop than planned!  After 2 hours and 2 full trollies  by the time we get to the check out - patience was wearing thin.  Our little girl was irritable  our baby was screaming - they were fed up  we were fed up (the people behind us in the queue were fed up!)   2 of your wonderful staff came to the rescue!    We didn t catch their names  but a gentleman and a lady  both with headsets on  so I assume your Check out Managers / Supervisors.  They gave our little girl a banana to keep her occupied  unloaded our trolley onto the belt so my wife could take the baby out and offered to help with the packing.    We thanked them for their kind help - but their service was above and beyond - so I d be very grateful if our appreciation could be reiterated to them and their managers made aware of their excellent service.    Well done Tesco!					2016-12-29T12:15:32+0000	1483013732	2016-12-29 13:15:32	19	3	19	0	22	3	1	2	3	0	19	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I was approaching the parent and child parking (I have a 1 yr old who was with me) a car reversed into the place next to me. The driver was on his own  he took up 2 spaces and proceeded to stare at me the whole time I walked towards the door. I reported that he was in a parent and child space to customer service and even pointed him out  he verbally abused me in the store and the lady I reported it to asked him if he was parked in a P&C space  he replied yes but I only came in for a magazine  to which she replied  oh  ok then .....  The car park wasn t full  and in fact there was a vacant parking space right outside the door.   How is it acceptable for this to happen? Maybe I should park in the disabled parking and do the same? Or perhaps I should park across 2 normal spaces so I have room to get my child out of the car?					2016-12-29T11:48:29+0000	1483012109	2016-12-29 12:48:29	0	13	1	0	14	13	6	7	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Since then nearly every nappy change has resulted in the gel beads filling the nappies. I regularly change my children so the nappies were not necessarily very full which I understand is usually the reason for the gel beads coming out. What can be done about this? It seems like it s a dodgy batch if I m getting it practically on every nappy.					2016-12-29T10:32:16+0000	1483007536	2016-12-29 11:32:16	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am trying to work out why  if I can still access the order on the system and the call centre can still access the system to know that I have an order today & get my phone number  someone at another store  or the call centre cant just copy the order and paste it into an email & send it in to the Rutherglen store?  I could even forward my last  your amended order  email to the store manager/picking team?  To just say  we are cancelling all orders  is a bit rubbish because if I came up with a solution with only 5 minutes thought  why couldnt your logistics/delivery team? There s more than one tesco store in the Glasgow area btw  could the Rutherglen vans not have worked from one of the other stores for just the one day?  Maybe you should just go back to the perfectly acceptable  one of the vans has broken down  excuse because  the system is down  is full of plot holes...					2016-12-29T10:12:13+0000	1483006333	2016-12-29 11:12:13	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Shocking. Same number of hankies per box. Look out for other  paper product  and  household  increases. They always go for this type of product and hope you don t notice because you don t buy them so often...

We were staying in Bristol at the time  and I purchased these from the Fishponds store some time in the middle of the night (life with a newborn üôÑ) when it was self-serve only  and I forgot to get the security tags taken off. I had them put away until last week when I went to wrap them  and only discovered then that the tags are still on. My local Tesco now is the Cirencester store. I no longer have the receipt  so I m wondering if I was to either call the store beforehand  or when I go to the store  go directly to the security officer standing by the door before I walk in  would I be able to have get the tags taken off without the receipt?					2016-12-29T07:07:33+0000	1482995253	2016-12-29 08:07:33	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Iwas on holiday to Huntingdon over Xmas and on boxing day I went to your store and got a few items. I paid it all in cash but on returning home to Scotland I found that a set of the pyjamas I got still has the electronic tag on it  i called the customer services team who said without the receipt my closest store wouldn t take the tag off. I can t find my receipt  I may have left it at my friends house or in her car or just lost it. But I don t drive so the closest tesco store to me is 2 buses there and 2 buses back. The home delivery vans are always iny street as a lot of people use it. I don t no if they have mobile de-tagers in them? But I don t want to need to get 4buses if the store will not take the tag off. I would be cheaper for my just to bin the item. Is there anything you can do to help?					2016-12-28T22:11:02+0000	1482963062	2016-12-28 23:11:02	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Like a very calm hungry animal a tore opened the crisps (carefully) in great awe of what I was about to consume. And then... I peered inside  it seemed a long way to travel... for my pack only appeared to be less than half full!  I can only begin to imagine what happened to the other half of my crisps  the first thoughts are that these are hand cooked and there for Steve? I m going to call him Steve... who cooks these must have consumed the other half upon realising how moreish these crisps can be. Honestly  it has caused my mind to race with thoughts on what could have happened  and I think we need to investigate the possibility of crisps evaporating.

Yesterday was 27th!!! I am not happy one bit...I was straight on phone to store where a very rude duty manager exact words to me were  what do you want me to do about it ..well I then turned up at store to be told this manager was too busy to deal with me and sent the fresh manager instead who then proceeded in giving every possible excuse he could think of including  it s come to us from manufacturer ... it s been christmas  and even  how do you know it s the drink that made your child sick it ok to use after 2 weeks ...regardless what excuse he wants to give...it is not safe to sell and should of been disposed of on the night on the 12th if not sold!! I am in process of taking this further...however I might add he did give me a ¬£15 voucher for my daughter to cheer her up...¬£15 to buy my silence more like!!!

I asked one of your customer services staff about it and all they said was oh it can be like that cheaper online! No offer to match it and sell me one for the online price for my boys! Then I said ok so I can order click and collect and get next day delivery and then to be told no sorry we don t do next day here it will be more like 2-5 days delivery!!! There were the exact TVs sat right there infront of my face and it will take 2-5 days for you to get my order in!!!!! Honestly Tesco sort yourselves out it s terrible service!!

We had so many items missing/ replaced that we didn t really check over the things we actually did have delivered. Apparently supplying us 4 lemons which would be past their sell by date within 8 hours  and which promptly went mouldy today was a decision your pickers felt comfortable with. All I wanted was a gin and tonic without any mould in it!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15672667_10154273407251229_7937986452714294075_n.jpg?oh=0f459e2ee7e0edc040037a1fc864d768&oe=58D74A89	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15672667_10154273407251229_7937986452714294075_n.jpg?oh=2863f05ab3f74520fc1b9cf33e40ccef&oe=591FA584	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154273407251229&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-28T17:51:24+0000	1482947484	2016-12-28 18:51:24	2	5	7	0	12	5	2	3	3	0	2	0	2	2	0	1	0

Spent a long time not going in that shop as so many are rude but returned the past year or so and it s been nice to see polite members of staff again  sadly today that wasn t the case. I really feel sorry for the poor people working over the Christmas period but he was just plain rude.					2016-12-28T17:26:58+0000	1482946018	2016-12-28 18:26:58	0	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

The Hatchimal has now become a thorn in my side. After searching for one for my great granddaughter  who is 8 years old  for a surprise christmas present I thought all my troubles were over when I was visiting my stepdaughter in Watford and we shopped in your Extra store there. Eureka !! Ifound a pink Hatchimal sitting there   I bought it   thought problems solved. Christmas day arrives and my great granddaughter arrives at my home with Mum and Dad for dinner. She opens all her gifts first and then i gave her the Hatchimal which she didn t know she might be getting. The excitement on her face  she couldn t believe that she had one. She does have problems in getting over excited so she was getting frustrated getting it out of the packaging so I took it out and she proceeded to follow the instructions as she saw them to get this thing to Hatch. after twenty minutes of her getting more and more frustrated and no sign of anything happening with this Hatchimal   I started to investigate it . i followed the instructions to the letter and it did absolutely nothing ?? There was no obvious signs of how to check batteries or even where they fitted in etc. During the initial handling the shell did start to feel soft and pliable in parts and pieces of the shell came off for us to discover this tiny little wide eyed creature sitting inside doing absolutely nothing ??? Now for  cutting the long story short  what has made it worse was that one of her cousins also received one and we have since seen what they are supposed to do so we are now certain that we have a DUD. I went on line to a website they said to check in the instructions and then found a free phone number to ring to troubleshoot. This kept me on the line with a recorded voice asking me to wait and some one would attend to me . Needless to say after patiently waiting for two hours( good job it was free) I got tired and hung up. I then went on line to tesco site   which i now realise is the Tesco Direct  and found the number to contact some one with regards to this. i have spoken them today and after going through all the ritual of name number etc. and asking me to hold  a very polite young man then informs me that they have no record of my order on my account ?? I again explained that i bought it in the store and he then said oh Im sorry we can t help you   this is Tesco Direct so we have no record of your buying this item. he said i would have to return it to the store. As I bought it in Watford and I live a couple of hundred miles away I don t think this was very helpful. I would like some one to come back to me to advise what to do now with a totally defunct Hatchimal   a lot of money out of pocket and most important of all a most upset  disappointed great granddaughter  and no type of recompense can help sort this out. She is just so upset. I look forward to hearing from some one by return to try and resolve this for her.

They should be told that once they ve accepted a job offer they must serve customers as they expect to be served  and that includes the purchase of alcohol (provided they re over 18 of course) . If the recruit disagrees with that  then the job offer should be withdrawn and the person told to go seek employment elsewhere.

It was absolutely shocking!  For starters it dropped its glitter everywhere!! Now I am all for a bit of sparkly glitter  it s beautiful  but when the 1970s called me to ask for their glitter pants back   you know it s verging on too much! Secondly I had to take out shares in sellotape  as the poor stuff couldn t stick to the paper!  And thirdly  if I d have had a pound for every person that uttered the words  wow isn t this glittery  or  god I m now covered in glitter   I d have made a small fortune!

While away in Spain I ordered an online gift card for a friend in the UK.  Tescos refused the order.  Despite the fact I was paying with a British credit card.  Are they completely nuts that they can afford to turn away business?  Their customer services have given some very odd replies to my complaints.  Are they the next business to bite the dust?					2016-12-28T12:12:36+0000	1482927156	2016-12-28 13:12:36	0	10	0	0	10	10	1	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I tried to return a dress today with tags still intact and receipt for an exchange and they refused as their was a small mark on the dress. They made the statement that they would of not  sold it like that  so was insinuating that I was lying or even committing an act of fraud!! I was mortified of being refused and there was people waiting behind me. If the item is faulty then it really isn t my problem and for the lady to make a broad statement that they would of not sold it like that when I did not even buy it In that store is ridiculous  how can she say that the deligence of all staff at Tesco is the same  so the customer is wrong and a liar instead!!!

I pay monthly for Tesco deliveries which included priority orders for Christmas. Just a few things that I ordered but weren t in stock for delivery on the 22nd Dec: vanilla ice cream  several snack items  salad boxes  pate and Christmas pudding. And to top that off the parsnips went out of date on the 23rd... the day after they were delivered  and two days before Christmas Day! The bread had mould on it which of course made it inedible. All in all not a very successful Christmas shop and it meant that despite paying monthly for my delivery I had to go elsewhere last minute to pick up missing items.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15747644_769884876498179_6928428329631030461_n.jpg?oh=c4747add6545caa80a2aef13ad3052ae&oe=5921F9CA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15747644_769884876498179_6928428329631030461_n.jpg?oh=eccaad62db6f3797be9a5518ca081f4d&oe=58E1F635	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=769884876498179&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-28T11:20:50+0000	1482924050	2016-12-28 12:20:50	0	5	4	0	9	5	5	0	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	3	0

I have been told there may be one in your Hull store but that you can t transfer stock from store to store.

I went there yesterday to exchange a gift my neephew had for Christmas. I was told to take a non electrical toy to the electrical desk  when asked why as it s not electrical the staff member said she would serve me. I explained I didn t have a receipt and she just smiled at me. I chose a few items went back to the desk and she told me I had to find items to the same value and couldn t put the difference on a gift card. So off I went and did some food shopping. I picked up some wrapping paper and a member of staff told me they were still in the 3 for 2 offer even though they were reduced. I took all my bits to the desk to get served for the 3rd time and asked her to check if the paper was in the offer to which she smiled at me in-between chatting to her mates at the desk. I was told yes (in reply to my question about the paper and it came up on the till) Brilliant I thought  managed to pay the difference for my good in between her chatting to her mates and hardly looking at us let alone speak to us. She was so engrossed in her conversation  she didn t ask if I had a Clubcard. So after serving me I asked her to add the point to which she huffed. I left the store biting my tongue. Got home and checked my receipt and the wrapping paper didn t come up as 3 for 2. Im more annoyed with the fact that she had no time for us as customers and was more interested in talking to her colleague mates and was dismissive of us more than the fact she blatantly had no idea i had asked about the paper and just smiled at me.					2016-12-28T08:16:16+0000	1482912976	2016-12-28 09:16:16	0	7	1	0	8	7	5	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

When I went into store it was ¬£59.90  I was told by one of you staff this was due to the cost of it being delivered to the store  and then told I could click and collect it for free and it would be delivered to store tomorrow? I m not one for stating the obvious but why am I being charged in store for delivery to buy in store but can have it delivered to the same store for free via click and collect?! Unfortunately I couldn t wait until tomorrow (today) as the post Christmas apocalypse in my house was too much to look at for another day!					2016-12-28T06:58:03+0000	1482908283	2016-12-28 07:58:03	4	6	4	0	10	6	4	2	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Staff were eager to help and direct me to the items I missed. It made the whole Christmas shopping  ordeal   less stressful. I enjoyed my coffee at the instore Costa too.

I m still finding glitter where glitter should not be! My hoover has quite literally given up the ghost after cleaning the floors for the 500th time since wrapping the presents I had. Then  after hours of struggling with glitter being all over myself and my two dogs  the paper didn t even stay stuck down! Endless rolls of sellotape was used but it still would not stick! I m pretty sure that I will still be finding glitter for the next 6 months or more! On the plus side  if it s still there next Christmas then I can simply recycle the glitter all over the floor onto the wrapping paper that I will very carefully choose to go in the place of the endless rolls of glitter reindeer paper that I still have lurking on the naughty step in my house.					2016-12-27T22:47:15+0000	1482878835	2016-12-27 23:47:15	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I rang up to tell Tesco customer service the issue last Wednesday they said they had no more of the TVs in stock and instead offered me a 43inch tv when I paid for a 49  when I declined this the lady offered me a 49 inch lG tv to be told an hour later I couldn t have it as it was too much for Tesco to pay out! Tesco said they would ring me back on the Thursday which they didn t I rang them so after being put through to a manager finally on the Thursday he offered me my refund 199.99 plus 50 pounds compensation  I brought the tv in the Black Friday sale as I could not afford one this good at the prices they normally are  I would not be able to buy a 49 inch tv now for ¬£250 so I refused the offer! the manager then promised he would find another 49 inch tv and would contact me the next day  Friday by this point still no contact from them so I rang them myself and they promised I would hear from them Christmas Eve morning  Boxing Day 4pm I finally decided it was time to ring them again as they hadn t contacted me and apparently the person who was dealing with the issue left the business and no one took the issue on  the new manager I spoke to offered me the 200 pounds refund and 50 ponds on top again I refused as I can t buy a tv at that price! Very fed up after being on the phone to at least 8 different people and explaining my situation 8 different times for them to say that I still have no other option very fed up and all I want is a 49 inch tv! It s not my fault mine is no longer in stock! Working in retail myself I have tried to remain as professional as possible but this is now ridiculous  customer service very poor and still not a resolution!

It was the prettiest wrap I have seen in a long time  unfortunately my house  clothes  body and dog are completely covered in the glitter! The paper was useless as it did not stick and the glitter has not come off of my furnishings. After speaking to many people it also seems they have had the same experience! Well done with the look of the design but a huge thumbs down for the practicalities of it.					2016-12-27T21:39:27+0000	1482874767	2016-12-27 22:39:27	1	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	4	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

Went to make dinner for my family tonight and the chicken was still raw on the inside  still bleeding. This is shocking as we could now all have food poisoning.

However  Tesco bank were not so helpful. We pay money into Tesco clubcard plus account every month throughout the year to pay for our Christmas shopping. When we came to pay this year however we were told to use alternative payment even though we knew there was enough money in the account. Customer service phoned the bank who couldnt help as account wasnt set up for phone banking. This account was set up in 1997 when it wasnt the norm for telephone banking and we have used the card every year without a problem. So that was the end of that  they couldnt do anything about the fact we had no way of paying for our Christmas food. Thank you Tesco  you have a lot of our money in an account we can t access until we get sent a password in the post üò†. As I said can t fault the staff in the shop but higher up are useless.					2016-12-27T20:47:33+0000	1482871653	2016-12-27 21:47:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I still have the packaging from the product. Visited the Tescos store of purchase (Fulham Palace rd) and they couldnt log the complaint???  Called customer service and they tell me to go to a large store (Brooklands Byfleet) so I did that and they tell me they cant log the complaint???  I mean what a terrible set up for customer service! Been really unwell  lost my Christmas with my kids and they havent even apoligised instead just bickering between stores.   Trying not to take it to Environmetal health but if you dont sort yourselves out ill be left no choice.   Oh and when revisiting the Fulham store I found more sandwiches out of date still!

So I don t bring with me anymore my card.  But in your stupid till I can t pay ¬£39 with apple watch.

We weren t the only ones.  Slightly annoying when the website says the store is open for another 6 hours. Don t really like Asda  but we ve had to go there instead.  Now we re running late  lost in a strange shop lol. So many people rely on your website for opening times over the Christmas period. It s a bit of a silly oversight to make.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15747516_10154253228317029_285939720313104311_n.jpg?oh=4ff4df10cd584e36feb81baa0f7a0f50&oe=58E91486	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15747516_10154253228317029_285939720313104311_n.jpg?oh=0a020047aa746096e7c09004e7fb8188&oe=5922C993	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154253228317029&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-27T18:16:29+0000	1482862589	2016-12-27 19:16:29	1	8	1	0	9	8	3	5	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

While breastfeeding my baby there today she came to ask if I would like some water myself and then brought some over for me. A small but very welcome gesture.

I called several times to find out where my parcel had gone  and was later informed it was lost in delivery I understand this may happen often  but the person I then spoke to informed me he would ensure a replacement item was sent out to me as soon as they came back in stock.  However on the 24th of November (7 weeks after I had placed my original order) you had more in stock and failed to send me a replacement hatchimal  so again I called to be told that you would never just resend me an item once it was in stock  so why keep my money for 7 weeks?  This service you have provided is absolutely disgusting and I am really unhappy about being lied to!!

Every time he plays with it the track seems to fall apart as the wooden supports just slip out causing the track to fall down. As this is designed for small children it doesn t seem to make sense for it all to just balance causing it to constantly collapse with the slightest amount of pressure or smallest bump to the table which is to be expected from small children. Sadly this has caused many tears and a lot of upset over the last two days. I would defiantly not recommend this product to anyone and feel very disappointed that we spent the money on it for our son. We sadly also bought another of your train sets to go with it (which we haven t yet been brave enough to open) costing us almost ¬£100 along with all the extras bought for him by friends and family. All in all a real waste of ours and other people s money and one very upset little bot for Christmas !!!!

The Lamborghini aventador that we bought for our little boy for ¬£124.95 for Christmas is faulty and I returned it today to get a refund of ¬£29.90 because it was purchased in your 3 for 2 promotion. It wasn t the cheapest free product (which incidentally was ¬£94.99) but the most expensive one! Why are we being penalised for having been supplied a faulty product just because it was bought during a promotion!!! Tesco I have lost all faith in you! Think we will shop in Sainsbury s from now on  you have just lost loyal customers of 10+ years and we now have one very heartbroken little boy.					2016-12-27T17:00:23+0000	1482858023	2016-12-27 18:00:23	0	12	0	0	12	12	7	5	12	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I order regularly from you  in fact I have 2 deliveries a week. I ordered a leg of lamb that has been in my basket for days in today s shop. It didn t turn up and apparently there was nothing else in the entire shop that was suitable as a substitution! I guess we should just eat fresh air then!!! When I checked my shop yesterday it did say the item could not be increased in quantity but I assumed you d probably have enough to fulfil my order. It didn t say not available. What should I do then? I don t live anywhere near a Tesco or other large supermarket.					2016-12-27T16:36:24+0000	1482856584	2016-12-27 17:36:24	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The only think I feel cheated by was the price ¬£29.99 which I felt like was a steal . You could easier charge ¬£50 for it. It beats any competitor out there.  And here s me thinking of paying over ¬£80 and yet this cheap soup maker does more than a leading competitor.   Well done tesco.   I ll be spreading the word to my friends about how great this product is...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15727130_1754255918229922_6763523505769647340_n.jpg?oh=ed7783b18ebbb9ec994f96914f47315f&oe=592122D9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15727130_1754255918229922_6763523505769647340_n.jpg?oh=c74144461e8b8d82a9439d8436dc9a9a&oe=58E8E9CC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1754255918229922&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-27T16:22:57+0000	1482855777	2016-12-27 17:22:57	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I d got back I realised there was a bottle of bleach that had leaked & it had ruined my clothes. I spoke to your customer services team who had arranged for a duty manager to call me back. I was called back within 5 minutes & spoke to a lady named Jasmine. She was very apologetic (although it wasn t her fault) she arranged to reimburse me towards the replacement of the clothes with no issues whatsoever. I don t know Jasmine s surname but I would like to inform you that myself as a customer am more than satisfied with the service I received today & think the service should be recognised. People are quick to complain about a bad service but not so quick to recognise a good one.

The big banner at the entrance stated clearly : -with spent every RM 50 and above  we are entitle for a RM 5 voucher; -with spent every RM 100 and above  we are entitle for a RM 10 voucher.   But when we were redeem the voucher from the customer service  the receptionist with poor attitude telling us that the voucher was no more  and chase us away.   RM 10 voucher is not a big amount  but if the voucher was finished  please at least put down the banner. This irresponsible act is generally creating confusion for the consumers and making us feels like Tesco is cheating or tricking the consumers to spend more but what we got is just an empty promise at the end of the day.   We believe Tesco always offer the best deal to the consumer  that s why we choose Tesco as our first choice of grocery shopping. But an act like this will break our trust to shop at Tesco in the coming future.   Please do look into this matter!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15727254_10211490537320829_5489456092390453283_n.jpg?oh=b1548c741adc576918e56662933a3f01&oe=591D13CB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15727254_10211490537320829_5489456092390453283_n.jpg?oh=0dce62164c5325f4611dc7e892f9a3d0&oe=591AD6C6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211490537320829&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-27T14:17:59+0000	1482848279	2016-12-27 15:17:59	16	8	18	2	28	8	6	2	3	0	16	0	1	0	0	1	0

Not very helpful.  Thank you all for your chemist suggestions.  It seems Tesco and Sainsbury s are the only ones open.  Do not bother going to Tesco if you want to speak to the Pharmacist.  We are constantly encouraged  to seek advice from a Pharmacist as they are underused.  Well this one could not be bothered to come out from behind his hideyhole and left the assistant to do all the questioning.  She was very pleasant and willing but as there was no one else there I would have appreciated speaking directly to him instead of her having to relay my symptoms and check with him what she thought would be ok.  It was like a game - not on Tesco  have a word with him.üò°					2016-12-27T13:09:15+0000	1482844155	2016-12-27 14:09:15	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On tesco advice I rung the helpline and spoke to the Sony rep. Who informed me that warranty began 3 months before I bought it and it is a refurbished ps4. Firstly this breaks trading laws as I was informed I was buying a new ps4 not a refurbished one. Secondly  this has caused upset for both myself and my son due to the fact he has been left without a main Christmas present. I suggest that as a large company your marketing and sales practices should be of a much higher level					2016-12-27T12:23:18+0000	1482841398	2016-12-27 13:23:18	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I said that didn t seem like a short date since it was 4 days away and that we planned to have them on the 31st anyway so would be fine. I was very disappointed to see  as I was unpacking  that they actually had a date of the 29th. If this had been accurate on the receipt I would have returned them. Also  I had a delivery a week ago today. The delivery driver was new but extremely pleasant and cheerful. I had ordered 2x4 packs of D batteries but as a substitute I was send 3x2 packs of the same for the same price. I said i should have been sent 4 packs of 2 and the driver agreed and it was agreed I Would return them and reorder for the delivery I had booked for 2 days later. It was a very big order so I didn t notice that I hadn t had my 4 cases of Pepsi max until the delivery driver phoned later that evening and told me he forgot to bring them. He offered to bring them but we agreed he would refund them and I would just add them to my order for Thursday. I then got an email 2 days later telling me I had been refunded for 1 pack of batteries and 1 case of Pepsi max. Despite emailing customer services Thursday last week and speaking to 2 delivery drivers about it since  no one has got back to me regarding this issue. I am short of a refund for 2 packs of batteries and 3 cases of Pepsi max.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15726454_10153919413841580_3780914758076028404_n.jpg?oh=a145b2cc29528c5bc99493b0771be1ed&oe=58DAE6CC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15726454_10153919413841580_3780914758076028404_n.jpg?oh=3f137d4e3bae55454d16f5ff7be3945f&oe=58D6DEB8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153919413841580&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-27T11:53:18+0000	1482839598	2016-12-27 12:53:18	3	6	3	0	9	5	2	3	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ordered your Yule log as it didn t state anything about May Contain nuts. We noted other puddings did so ordered it for me to eat. We saw nothing on the packaging when it arrived. We opened it today and on the inside label it stated  may contain nuts . This is very dangerous. I could have eaten this and suffered a reaction.

We today went to the Chepstow store to purchase some beers and in all the hustle and bustle seen some kopperberg reduced to ¬£3 thought great what a bargain so grabbed the two remaining wrapped boxes  assuming a few bottles had been smashed hence the cling film  got them home after getting two tired kids out of the car that the bottles were actually Becks  no problem we thought. At the end of the day it s still drink right? Well no actually it s not when you open them and find that in fact the contents is Becks Alcohol Free!! No where on the cling film or any label was there an indication so here s to an alcohol free evening thanks to Tesco !!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15697306_10154940245917948_7725136636933408897_n.jpg?oh=ef4d7a86dcbf73e54f1f7ab61199b6c9&oe=58D958A8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15697306_10154940245917948_7725136636933408897_n.jpg?oh=29059c4e35a3b38f2ae18cdfced45df9&oe=592450A5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154940245917948&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-26T18:23:08+0000	1482776588	2016-12-26 19:23:08	0	16	0	0	16	14	8	6	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The varifocals are too big and of no use at all.the lenses do not fit on her face as she is not looking through the right part of the lens as they are slipping down and it is not possible to get the frames to fit across the bridge with the high cyl rx the frame isn t suitable as it doesn t fit and needs to be changed. She immediately went back to Tesco who didn t even check the frames  she wrote to the manager of the store and his superior  neither of whom have given her the courtesy of a reply. She is now left ¬£344 out of pocket that had been spent on glasses that are of no use! She now has spend more money on another pair of glasses. This is a serious amount of money for someone to loose who has to live on a pension.					2016-12-26T17:36:45+0000	1482773805	2016-12-26 18:36:45	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought three pairs of pyjamas for my children and I for Xmas night. My daughter s size 8-10 set which were tied with ribbon were in fact a size 16-18 and still had the security tag on the trouser waist. My son s set also had the security tag right in the middle of the tee shirt. We were away from home so had nothing else to wear. Not happy. Will be taking it up with my local store upon our return. What is the point in security tags if I can purchase two items and leave the store without triggering the alarm?					2016-12-26T16:16:03+0000	1482768963	2016-12-26 17:16:03	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This morning I had myself a lie in after singlehandedly juggling toy construction  dinner and clean up. I literally build things on the kitchen floor while cooking diner. The price I paid for my lie in is the boys decided to build this set themselves something which I don t really allow as they are heavily handed  lose pieces etc. The eldest whose present this was meant for has ASD. His younger brother thought the brushes on the car were not important and pulled them off. Of course I could tell straight away the brushes were what connected the track to the power source and allowed it to work so in short one of the cars is nackered. The one who broke it is upstairs breaking his heart over it while the child with asd is taking it in his stride.

While carving the crowns to serve up christmas lunch i was rather disappointed to find not only big legs left on the crowns but a lot of other bone too  never had this before with crowns from Tesco.  Therefore  i don t think these crowns were good value for money  less meat and more bones! Normally a crown id all good meat and no waste!!!!!  Luckily enough i alway go over board and cater for more than i need so i have extra meat for the following days to feed the guests  so we all had enough for our christmas lunch.

Went in today for some groceries and was with my guide dog. Looking at the chilled products to be approached by the security and told   Dogs aren t allowed in the shop . Spoke to the manager of the store and no real apology nothing and nothing from the security guard. To say I am upset and disgusted is beyond words. I will not be shopping in store again and will be forwarding this to Guide Dogs as it is discrimination and illegal to one trying to refuse entry and 2 speaking to me in manner in which I was spoken.					2016-12-26T14:46:34+0000	1482763594	2016-12-26 15:46:34	0	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I purchased a lap top for my son in October all seemed ok so didn t break the seal and open the box fully.  Christmas day one happy 11 year old over the moon with his new 2 in 1 laptop  switch it on and the screens cracked!!!!!.  Problem 1 we bought it before Nov 1st. (Not covered by Xmas guarantee)  Problem 2 we bought it part payment with vouchers (not going to have the money to buy else where)  Problem 3 you no longer stock this item!!  Result a very sad 11 year old who no longer has his main present. A refund from Tesco of ¬£115 which will not cover the cost of a new lap top.  All in all today has been an horrible experience and wasted a whole hour and a half in store to come away with nothing. Feeling savage but mainly disappointed and let down.					2016-12-26T14:05:50+0000	1482761150	2016-12-26 15:05:50	0	9	1	0	10	9	7	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

I went to self service to check I was reading it correctly.  One staff said it might say Feb 18 not Feb 16.  Called a team leader who said  and I quote...  well obviously it means February 16th  and will be 2017 not 2016  i stated that the coca cola company wouldn t state the day and month but omit the year!!! He rushed off  he came back  said yes they re out of date and ran away with the product.  The lady on self serve then went on to blame temporary staff stating that temp staff don t care!! I informed her that I thought that was a kop out ... You have had temp staff for a month or so... The product is 10 months out of date!!! The other staff I encountered were great... One was a temp who gave better customer service than the other 2 combined!!!					2016-12-26T12:05:26+0000	1482753926	2016-12-26 13:05:26	1	7	5	1	13	7	4	3	2	0	1	0	3	0	0	1	0

After peeling off the skin  in a manner akin to finding the end of the sellotape  I could see the reason I couldn t carve it was because it was all bone. I barely managed to offer a family of 6 a tablespoon sized portion of turkey each which I d managed to peel from the legs and wings. I m not going to claim it ruined Christmas because  frankly  Christmas consists of more than a few slices of warmed up bird corpse but I can t say I m happy having paid ¬£25 for food items expected to provide for a few meals only to find it couldn t effectively cover a single family Christmas dinner.					2016-12-26T12:02:38+0000	1482753758	2016-12-26 13:02:38	0	3	0	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Within minutes yesterday Stretch Scooby burst leaving a gloopy mess all over the kitchen. We ve just called customer service who advised Scooby is out of stock and all we can have is ¬£1 to reimburse us as it s the 3 for 2 offer. This item wasn t fit for purpose and we want our little girl to have a one that is! A refund means nothing   she really wants her toy! Also  if you have any tips to remove the gloop from the kitchen worktop  that would be great too. #giftfail					2016-12-26T10:33:42+0000	1482748422	2016-12-26 11:33:42	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought I d nailed it with the Tesco Finest Reveal Dessert (even though I begrudged spending ¬£12.00 on a chocolate pudding).  We followed the instructions to the letter and even turned the music off in anticipation of the promised sound of popping candy - I think someone had accidently used  pooping  candy in ours!  I suspect that the small proportion of the dessert that got eaten will look the same in the toilet bowl tomorrow as it did on our festive table today.  Happy Christmas.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15672957_10207825407941155_7910893953989463170_n.jpg?oh=24314ad7318bf18bcc6e124fa50bd052&oe=58DC7CE9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15672957_10207825407941155_7910893953989463170_n.jpg?oh=fe5219e7cdab7972ee3b1c471610331a&oe=5918C1E4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207825407941155&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-25T21:30:48+0000	1482701448	2016-12-25 22:30:48	6	2	14	0	16	2	2	0	0	0	5	0	1	7	0	0	0

I ordered my Xmas shop for delivery a while back. In the time from them until the delivery I moved house (very short notice) I called your main office and explained the situation and they were very helpful and contacted the store. They were able to deliver to my new address which I know isn t the normal. Thank you!					2016-12-25T21:30:05+0000	1482701405	2016-12-25 22:30:05	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I hope all of your staff are far too busy to reply to me today! They should be eating and drinking to excess and enjoying the day with their families.  But when you re back you really need to look at this. Pictured is what happened today when I laid out a pack of twelve Yorkshire puddings for our traditional turkey dinner (my daughter insists that yorkie puds are for life and not just for beef dinners - as she is five years old with the strength of will that would put many developing world dictators to shame I tend to agree with her  you re welcome to argue but I will hide) So imagine our disappointment to find only 11 in the bag! Arguably only 10 were conforming to your usual wonderful shape but without a doubt we were down 1 pudding.  So with this one act of cost cutting you have basically ruined Christmas  I don t wish to be over dramatic but we had to throw the turkey and trimmings away  literally ruined today and potentially the scars may live on with us for many years to come.   What would the baby Jesus say?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15697309_10211615601884665_767445270342614294_n.jpg?oh=42845b1d8399e9675ce54a6a0a851b74&oe=58E0AFB6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15697309_10211615601884665_767445270342614294_n.jpg?oh=a2a017da2cc4a000e19385378f7ff95a&oe=58DABECA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211615601884665&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-25T18:35:26+0000	1482690926	2016-12-25 19:35:26	9	4	23	0	27	4	3	1	1	0	9	0	0	14	0	0	0

I am writing to seek some information on your Brussel sprouts. We are now two hours post Xmas dinner but the wind hasn t arrived. This has led to the cancellation of the twelfth annual Stokes family farting competition.   We have our suspicions that these sprouts have been genetically modified to reduce the output of the happy gasses that normally abound post dinner and support the competition.   As the defending champion  My 86 year old gran  is inconsolable that she hasn t had the opportunity to defend her crown. She had promised wind to match that of storm Barbara  We feel that you should‚Äã mark the packaging with estimated happy gas output so as to allow customers to make better choices.  I m not saying you have ruined our Christmas festivities but it has put a huge dent in family morale. The turkey crown and pigs in blankets were most excellent so we congratulate you on this aspect of the meal.   It could be there is a delay in the action of the sprouts and I will feed back if this is the case but we are normally well underway by now.  I would be grateful if you could confirm if anything has changed with the genetic make up of this usually wonderful vegetable.  Lastly we would like to thank all the wonderful staff at your Hunstanton store who bent over backwards to be so friendly and helpful with our Christmas shop. We wouldn t want there good name sullied by the failure of the sprouts.  Best wishes  The Stokes 					2016-12-25T17:05:26+0000	1482685526	2016-12-25 18:05:26	90	34	181	62	277	31	27	4	72	0	90	5	0	85	0	0	0

I agree that it is the owner s responsibility to monitor dogs while they play.  As such I want to make sure  as a responsible consumer  that owners know not to risk purchasing such a dangerous toy.   Please take responsibility as a brand and rethink the sale of such dangerous products.

It s not the menu I had planned for today  but the Tesco Finest Cornfed Chicken that was delivered on Friday 23rd December stank to high heaven when I opened it.  I checked the use by date and my heart sank  it was best before 24th December üò¢. I checked my delivery note and it wasn t in the  Items with a shorter life than we d like  or pointed out to me by the delivery driver that it would be past its use by date on Christmas Day.  Ok  so I didn t check the packaging  but is it unreasonable to think that items would have longer than one day s shelf life  especially the main component of Christmas dinner? Luckily I had 4 chicken nuggets  9 fish fingers and 6 pieces of last nights cold southern fried chicken.  I m not going to lay it on thick that Christmas was ruined  we are healthy  happy  together  and had a better dinner than some.  However  I would really appreciate a gesture of goodwill from you. My kids want a  proper  Christmas dinner tomorrow to make up for today s disappointment and i d very much appreciate it if tomorrow s dinner could be on you.

Really not happy :(					2016-12-25T15:38:30+0000	1482680310	2016-12-25 16:38:30	0	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

I brought this carousel 150 piece set for my son for Christmas from your Cheshunt extra store.  Upon opening it and getting half way through building we noticed it s missing some track pieces. Trying to explain to a very upset 3 year old we can t build it properly because pieces are missing is not how I imagined spending my Christmas Day. When you buy things you expect all the pieces to be there. I don t live in the area we brought it from and can no longer find the receipt. Any suggestions?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15740749_1284334091637387_2523574250753815301_n.jpg?oh=c00a599b1c3af14b972425259d5b1ecd&oe=5923BD9D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15740749_1284334091637387_2523574250753815301_n.jpg?oh=8651fff4564859a3a75f987a2ad79ac8&oe=58E09988	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1284334091637387&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-25T14:46:50+0000	1482677210	2016-12-25 15:46:50	0	5	0	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I opened the turkey earlier this morning and the smell is terrible so we can t cook that for today s Christmas lunch.  (I measure the temperature of my fridge which is never above 4.7C so it s not my storage Tesco - it s yours!)  I am bitterly disappointed - I thought you couldn t possibly do it twice.  Let s hope we have better luck with the meat you delivered - as that s now going to be our Christmas lunch - poor guests!					2016-12-25T09:25:00+0000	1482657900	2016-12-25 10:25:00	1	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

However  could you maybe pass a message on to them for the future.

Whilst waiting a member of your staff wearing blue jeans and a red top with blonde hair came up and tried to turn the self services machines on  another worker approached her and told her to keep them turned off as the store was closing in 5 minutes. She then stood there and and argued about management and how the woman would never answer when she needs to be called down to help them in the future. The poor colleague she was shouting at left her and walked away because she was causing a massive scene. She then decided to stop and tell all of her colleagues what had happened. She was completely unprofessional and was bad mouthing your management as well as her other colleague who was just clearly doing his job. It s people like her that brings shame upon companies. I honestly felt so sorry for the man who was just trying to do his job. This was about 6:55pm. I suggest you talk to whoever this person is because her language  tone of voice and professionalism were not at all in line with where they need to be.					2016-12-24T22:51:11+0000	1482619871	2016-12-24 23:51:11	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought 3 DVDs from your store in fforestfach retail park Pontardulais Road in Swansea this evening  got home only to realise that there was a faulty DVD hidden inside the cover of one of them  absolutely scratched to high heaven  that had been reshelved by one of your colleagues. It even had a lovely little note in it to let me know it was faulty when I got home and opened it.   The reason for me even removing it from its cardboard sleeve was because I could hear the disc rattling inside when i went to wrap it up.   I bought this as a last minute Christmas present along with the other 2 that I d purchased today  and if it wasn t for the disc rattling inside the box I would ve never pulled the cardboard cover off in the first place and would ve been completely unaware.   It only cost me ¬£5  and I m not that idiot who argues the toss over a ¬£5 purchase  I m more annoyed at the principle of my younger 8 year old brother being down a present now due to your members of staff and their incompetent behaviour. I m now unable to return this until the Christmas period has passed which completely defeats the object.   I hope someone of a senior position reads this and can give an explanation and a resolution better than  return it to the store  because that s not good enough as far as I m concerned.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15665770_10154671777935943_4723797575103700365_n.jpg?oh=dab1863c559e4d93be6b9d93fdf9a816&oe=58E2E3BD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15665770_10154671777935943_4723797575103700365_n.jpg?oh=cdff68ff38f43c1319cb15a8ef6becbb&oe=58E53CB0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154671777935943&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-24T20:44:13+0000	1482612253	2016-12-24 21:44:13	8	9	11	0	20	6	4	2	3	0	8	0	0	3	0	0	0

Not the easiest thing to hide... a 4ft 4 in 1 multi sports table. Tools at the ready  box is opened to find the table tops are damaged and split and pieces are missing!! The table cost ¬£75  he only has a couple of presents as that was expensive enough for me... instead of building it  thought maybe putting it back in box and wrapping it so we could put him off building it tomorrow and resolve the issue Boxing day with you. Go to look online and you not longer sell the item. So not sure how I am going to explain that one to a disappointed 4 year old on Christmas Day  let alone there is no alternative suitable or at an affordable cost!  Now to put it back into hiding and make the most of what we have got.  Merry Christmas Tesco!!!!					2016-12-24T20:02:31+0000	1482609751	2016-12-24 21:02:31	0	8	0	0	8	8	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went into your Hardwick store kings Lynn to witness masses of stuff being put into bin bags marked  not suitable for human consumption . The picture is of a whole trolley of bread products...It hadn t even been reduced in am attempt to sell it. The same was happening all over the fresh produce goods. At the front of the store they had a collection bin for donations for the food banks......

I visited Tesco new ollerton store today with my disabled mother. As I could imagine we was greeted by a very busy store!  My mum uses the wheel chairs that Tesco have  but today both were in use. Whilst hovering around in hope of locating one I was greeted by a lovely Gentleman called Douglas who was giving out free magic reindeer food to the passing children and to which he handed me some too for my children who were patiently waiting at home which I thanked him for. He then went out of his way to help locate a chair for my mother whilst we waited in the cafe with a cuppa and when he located one he came straight to us. We then went in to do our shopping two trolleys became a handful! So at the checkout who appears? Douglas!! What a little Gem he helped to bag up our shopping in a bigger trolley and then took it to our car where he then packed it In Our boot! He then went onto offer to return the wheel chair and trolley too but not before wishing us a wonderful Christmas!  Douglas you re a credit to Tesco! One of the nicest staff I ve ever met and I mean that!  I m sorry I didn t get your surname but I recall you telling me all about you being semi retired.  Tesco this guy deserves a well deserved pat on the back!  Merry Christmas to you all xx					2016-12-24T18:36:56+0000	1482604616	2016-12-24 19:36:56	15	7	20	2	29	7	7	0	6	0	15	5	0	0	0	0	0

My other two local supermarkets (Asda Aldi) was offering the essentials for 19p each...carrots  parsnips  potatoes  broccoli and sewed. Tesco was twice the price and more with the swede at ¬£1 and potatoes even higher. When I mentioned this to your staff at the octocal way store swindon the reply was .... there is a Aldi 2mins away so go there !  With this reply I emptied my full basket of veg rite there on the bananas n replied back ok I will... please it these back for me.  Also I had purchased 2 bath tin sets ( that s so Betty ) on sale of a caged table in middle of the store  these were marked up on yellow A4 price card reduced to ¬£3.50. On checkout I was charged ¬£7.50 and reported the charge to your customer service desk who said the price is correct without even looking and offered me a full refund  I said I want the items but the ticket showed ¬£3.50 and want it looked at.  The ladie went off to look and said it was the wrong ticket and had taken it off the stand. She then offered to refund me the over charge amount but when I said about the double the difference policy she said no as doing it as a good will gesture ..... I asked again about the policy and told the question is getting big n she was alone . My option is refund the over payment or full refund pick one. Well I took the part refund obviously but if you have these policy s then the staff should honour  them .  That s my rant over. Enjoy your Christmas üéÑ					2016-12-24T18:36:56+0000	1482604616	2016-12-24 19:36:56	1	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	3	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

I ordered from Tesco direct to be delivered Wednesday and was told twice to come back.  Went back today and the delivery was not there  had gone to the wrong store.  Everything in it was for stocking fillers/Xmas presents and while the girl on the counter (Donna) could not fix the situation she showed a genuine care and went to get a manager (Colin I think)  The manager walked me round the store to try find viable alternatives but there were none. While I don t have the goods I do feel that my custom is valued and your team do care so thank you for that.					2016-12-24T18:18:02+0000	1482603482	2016-12-24 19:18:02	30	9	31	1	41	9	4	5	10	0	30	0	0	0	1	0	0

My niece opened her reply today and was really chuffed with her letter and the extra surprise of a selection box...and it didn t cost a penny. She is also a huge fan of  the fruit that doesn t cost anything  and the little bags they have next to the box for her peelings/core. Tesco Kilbirnie is brilliant and is almost always a positive experience.					2016-12-24T17:56:47+0000	1482602207	2016-12-24 18:56:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 80 year old mother  and others  used this service until it was stopped  if she wants to get to Tesco there is a hill to climb to the nearest available bus stop or two main road to cross before a train station and a bridge to climb.  She uses a tri wheeler and find the distance to the bus stop and train station exhausting  if not impossible. SHAME ON YOU TESCO. I have voiced my opinion before and e-mailed you  but no reply. SHAME ON YOU AGAIN!!!! I won t be shopping there anymore and I shall tell colleagues  friends and I shall keep posting on Face Book until you decided to do something positive.					2016-12-24T16:28:17+0000	1482596897	2016-12-24 17:28:17	0	11	0	1	12	11	6	5	44	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He likes to ride his scooter to Tesco as we live locally. He always leaves his scooter in the correct place at the front with all the other scooters and buggies. After we finished our shop we were leaving when we realised we had forgotten my sons scooter so he ran back inside to get it. My son came back out in tears. He told me your security guard had called him a  stupid boy  because he had knocked someone elses scooter over. I went back inside to ask the security guard what had happened but immediately he was very aggressive verbally and started shouting at me. I asked for his name but he declined to give it to me so I took a picture of him that I can show you privately to identify. I then went to customer services and asked to speak with a manager. I told your manager what had happened and it really was evident my son was telling the truth because as I was telling the manager the security guard was telling other people about it and pointing at us. Your manager apologised to me and my son and let him chose out a box of chocolates as an apology which was very kind of you. Another of your workers at customer services told me that this was not the first time there had been problems with security guards but that there was little to be done because they are employed by a different company and not Tesco. As we were leaving the security guard was shouting at the manager who was trying to deal with the situation. I found this appalling but felt it better to leave it at that.  However I have now felt compelled to write a complaint on here because the security guard has since appear intimidating to us when we have gone back to Tesco Leytonstone on different occasion to do our weekly shop. Last week as myself and my son were walking into Tesco to do our weekly shop he pointed at us out to another security guard and was I assume telling his colleague god knows what about us. I ignored this. However today I popped in to Tesco Leytonstone with my son to pick up some last minute items. As we were walking down one of the isles the security guard walked up to us  stopped and starred at my son up and down. Again I ignored this and just pulled my son along by the hand.   This is not acceptable behaviour. I should be able to do my shopping in Tesco without feeling intimidated or worried. I live local and have shopped at Tesco Leytonstone since it opened. In fact I was present at Tesco Leytonstone when Dirty Den from Eastenders came to cut the ribbon to officially open the store! I spend a lot of money at Tesco Leytonstone as we dont have much of a high street and its literally around the corner from me but I will be forced to shop elsewhere should this sort of intimidation and unprofessional behaviour continue. I am being treated like what feels a potential thief and who knows what he has told other staff about me/us? If you are unable to do anything about this security guard then please could you provide me with the security firm he works for so I can make an official complaint to them about him.					2016-12-24T16:24:50+0000	1482596690	2016-12-24 17:24:50	0	0	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	2	0

Unfortunately  mine has become somewhat less merry due to a joint of pork purchased at your Hewitts Circus  Cleethorpes branch.  The packaging clearly states the meat  stored correctly (it was...) would last until 29th of December.  Imagine my dismay as I poured myself a seasonal beverage  prepared the oven  and unwrapped the pork to discover it was off... Very off! (I m an Undertaker  I know the sweet aroma of rotting meat...).  I can t get back to the store for a refund due to said seasonal beverage  so it looks as though it s Fish Fingers for dinner tomorrow.  I think Jesus liked fish.

I m currently 5 1/2 months pregnant and after trying to be careful of what I eat and being mindful of what I can t   I decided to endulge for Xmas and bought a father Xmas cheesecake for ¬£4 to be used this lastnight.  After our meal last night my partner took the cheesecake out of the fridge and portioned it up for us both. Just as I went to take my first bite  he came rushing in and told me to stop. Turns out the cheesecake was infact out of date. Although sold to us on the 22nd the use by date on the packaging was the 19th!!  it was 3 days passed it s sell by before it had even left the shop. I m absolutely disgusted.  had I had eaten this cheesecake being a fresh dairy product both myself and my partner could of been seriously ill over Xmas.  Without even mentioning the impact this would of had on my unborn child. I understand it s a busy time of year.  But for this item to of been left unnoticed for 3 days on the shelf is terrible!!!					2016-12-24T14:38:17+0000	1482590297	2016-12-24 15:38:17	1	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

You know  the extra receipts that come out of the printers that seem to surprise your staff every time. Now I know that I ve only had a clubcard for about 20 years and I guess I don t always do the shopping in my household but can I please ask a favour? For about the last 5 times I ve been offered a voucher/discount/offer etc they are following a similar trend as the picture shows... Now I know I m a mid 40s male and I know the kind of things I shop for  but then again you also know my details and what I shop for as I wave my little clubcard every time I come into your stores and I ve never bought any of these items in your stores and I suspect I m hardly the target audience for these items! So come on Tesco  what about a offer for beer or something a bit more manly!!!

Ordered some Christmas presents from Tesco photo on 15th December when their website state that the last order date for Christmas delivery is the 16th December.  Well after no correspondence from Tesco or the company that deal with their photo gifts  Max Spielmann  and with it now being Christmas eve and no sign of my gifts I am quite frankly appalled at their lack of Customer service and delivery process.  Considering my partner ordered from Photobox on Sunday 18th and received his calendar by the 21st I think people should bear this in mind when thinking about where to order your photo gifts from!!					2016-12-24T12:15:41+0000	1482581741	2016-12-24 13:15:41	0	10	0	0	10	10	1	9	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The whole reason why i went to tescos early in the morning was to get a turkey as i knew they would go fast. In the end i went to asda instead and got a turkey.					2016-12-24T12:10:52+0000	1482581452	2016-12-24 13:10:52	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For whatever reason our meat went missing in our delivery and he has just rang round all morning to find the same thing and get me it delivered today so we will be fed tomorrow! I m always very quick to moan  but the service he has just provided on what must be the busiest day was absolutely fantastic! I know it s just another meal  but he has gone above and beyond so I can spend my Christmas Eve not having to run around.					2016-12-24T11:23:43+0000	1482578623	2016-12-24 12:23:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Before closing they will reduce goods as per usual  wouldn t it have been a wonderful idea if they closed at 6pm and only opened their doors to people in need of  food banks   and any of the numerous organisations that will open its doors over Christmas for the homeless etc. ( regardless of religion). Bear in mind they re only closed for one day!!  Just a thought!					2016-12-24T11:10:44+0000	1482577844	2016-12-24 12:10:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got to the checkout and because it was a big order got picked for a random check. They  wanted to check 36 items then the first item she scanned caused a problem so she went to get someone else to help. I just finished saying to my children I hope the same thing doesn t happen as last year when an assistant scanned the same item twice causing us to need the whole order to be completely rescanned through a till when LO and behold the new assistant scans the same item that caused the initial problem. Aaaargh cue emptying every bag and putting whole shop through the till very bloody annoying and no sympathy from staff					2016-12-24T11:00:19+0000	1482577219	2016-12-24 12:00:19	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I  spoke to customer service   who in turn spoke to the driver; we were told he was on his way back  we waited until 11.30  but he never returned. To say I was unhappy was something of an understatement! I spoke with Angie in customer services this morning  she was brilliant  really understanding and apologetic. She spoke to a lovely lady at the store on our behalf who said that she would personally go and get our missing items and send a driver round this morning. Our items have just been delivered  with extra of all the veg items as an apology from the store. Thanks to your wonderful staff for saving our Christmas!					2016-12-24T10:56:28+0000	1482576988	2016-12-24 11:56:28	5	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 5 year old daughter was excited looking through the clothes section looking for something for her baby doll instead of a member staff smiling at her she was tutted at by one of your members of staff! I encouraged my daughter to be careful and tried to make conversation by asking what time she finished she abruptly said 7! My daughter continued to look through the clothes with the woman tutting if she accidentally dropped something! My daughter even commented after we left saying  why was that lady cross with me  #cheerupitschristmas!! #smilewouldntgoamiss					2016-12-24T09:15:02+0000	1482570902	2016-12-24 10:15:02	0	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0

It was busy with shoppers and staff  as to be expected. Staff trying to keep up with the demand of people doing their Christmas food shop  which I understand. I was disappointed to see the free from section barricaded with the store food trollies. I tried to move them and reach round them. It made for a frustrating experience - especially when other sections weren t this restricted by store food trollies. It felt like discrimination against people with different dietary requirements.  The rest of my shopping experience was fine  the staff were happy and the music made shopping more bearable!

Will I be sent a club card  or do I have to sign up to something different to get a club card?

We decided to come down during the early hours to miss the crowds before Christmas and your staff could not have been more helpful  happy and pleasant!  We experienced outstanding customer service  despite the poor decision for the store to close the upper level during the early hours during the Christmas period  a member of your team happily took us upstairs so we could get the bits we needed.  Then during the time going around the store shopping staff were so polite and joyful a real novelty to see and made our crazy 2am shopping trip far more enjoyable! We even had a little sing song to some frozen classics down a couple of the aisles finished off with a good chat with the staff at the checkout.  People are very quick to write bad reviews  but not everyone will write about a good experience so we just wanted to thank all the staff working up till Christmas  away from their families and loved ones so that we can get everything we need for the big day.  Wishing you all a very merry christmas and hope you all enjoy some well earned time off üíóüíóüíó	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15621943_10154473373394748_7364499454106866008_n.jpg?oh=b0875d0ff61932a57e7e7bb1244eea7c&oe=58E2C0BF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15621943_10154473373394748_7364499454106866008_n.jpg?oh=6b92b8805cd752b14411328e49591079&oe=58D60EB2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154473373394748&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-24T04:19:36+0000	1482553176	2016-12-24 05:19:36	13	0	14	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	13	1	0	0	0	0	0

My elderly mother purchased the size requested (8kg+)  because not only do we have 16 people eating on Christmas Day  but we also enjoy the leftovers on Boxing Day.    Although the turkey weighs 8.2kg the weight is a FROZEN WEIGHT! I have never encountered this before so  consequently  the turkey is much smaller than expected or have had in previous years on a similar weight but sold  for example  by Morrisons using its FRESH WEIGHT. Once stuffed  last year s Morrisons turkey overflowed the foil tin and just about fitted in the oven  there is no way your turkey will match this.  I feel angry and cheated that you are selling your turkeys at a frozen   weight (in the small print) which is totally misleading. Mum bought what I ask for  I personally would have gone elsewhere seeing the size.   Thanks Tesco  I now don t know if we have enough as your estimate of 15-18 is only a guide!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15672571_1702249910085103_2323007166209672911_n.jpg?oh=7ba438b693b9571998a39aa95c2ffc32&oe=58EEEF6B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15672571_1702249910085103_2323007166209672911_n.jpg?oh=46a37f822cdf3a4fbf9310c4c57f0cb0&oe=58E9927E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1702249910085103&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-24T01:25:36+0000	1482542736	2016-12-24 02:25:36	2	5	3	0	8	5	2	3	1	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0

My delivery arrived 2 and half hours late (12.30am)! And to top it off when carrying the boxes through to the kitchen we discovered that the double cream was completely open dripping through my hallway and onto my kitchen floor  so now we have to clean all that up and all the groceries it covered! Once it s all done I ll be lucky if I get an hour or twos sleep before I have to feed my baby for an hour  and then I ll be woken early by my 3 year old! Needless to say not the best start to the Christmas weekend.  ... full credit to your delivery men who are working exceptionally hard this time of year. Perhaps you shouldn t have issued so many delivery slots? I ll speak to you tomorrow when customer services are open					2016-12-24T00:46:12+0000	1482540372	2016-12-24 01:46:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However the supervisors who were  policing  the queueing system at the tills were extremely unhelpful and rude  referring to me as  she  discussing how I shouldn t  be at that particular til despite being invited by Georgina to use her desk.

My mum sent my family and i a ¬£100 tesco voucher to spend on extra christmas treats but sadly when our post arrived this morning it had been removed from the envelope.  Royal mail refused to even search the postmans bag and so we turned to tesco for some help. After trawling every shopping bag in the house my very upset mum managed to find a receipt that had the whole gift card number on it. Several calls to tesco later and they agreed to block the card from being used and even offered ¬£50 (sent to us via royal mail - no thanks!!) As a goodwill gesture instead of the ¬£100 voucher that had already been purchased. We requested a number of times that the full balance be transfered to a new card or even an online evoucher as we use tesco online weekly to do our ¬£200 food shop. This was absolutely  point blank refused. Why? We can prove the card was purchased  have receipts and credit card statements to back this up yet tesco  2 days before christmas wouldnt allow us the gift that had already been paid for for us.   We now have to rely on a post office claim form to POSSIBLY come up trumps and find our missing voucher but have been told it could take up to 12 weeks just to be processed. Assuming it hasnt already been pocketed by someone - likely!  #tesco  i am incredibly disappointed in your lack of cooperation today. The gift card was lost  we didnt want a refund  just the funds transfered so they could be spent in your store!  Bah humbug!					2016-12-23T23:43:38+0000	1482536618	2016-12-24 00:43:38	3	4	3	0	7	4	2	2	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

While going up and down the isles I came across 2 members of staff having a full in ear shot discusion and slagging match about customers. They were making comments about how many customers were at the store and how busy it was then to my disgust the comment came about how  metal  and  off our heads  we were for being there at this time of night!!!!   I feel now I need to explain WHY we were there at 10:30p.m with a 5 year. My daughter has a condition called hyperacousis.....Google it. It is where she has over sensitive hearing and being in a busy place  music and loads of people talking is scary  loud and over bearing. It is a documented disability and to have members of YOUR staff slagging YOUR customers off makes me sick. Totally disgusted at this and feel comments like that are what makes me scared people judge my daughter. I will not be back and am ashamed of the members of staff who made these comments. Maybe they should live one day in my daughters shoes and also be educated on hyperacousis and the affects these nasty comments have on my daughter  myself and customers. üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤					2016-12-23T23:28:58+0000	1482535738	2016-12-24 00:28:58	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Most people would assume it was a highly sought after item  or a very expensive item. No  it was under ¬£10 and not one of  the  Christmas toys of the year. She just wanted some pyjamas to go with the Sindy doll. For some reason  the doll is available on line but the outfits arent?? I had friends and family search in their Tesco for the outfits  but with no luck.  So I thought I would contact you. It all looked extremely hopeful. You have me two stores locally that were due delivery of the outfit my daughter wanted  you ensured that one was going to be put by for a friend to collect for me. My friend went in as arranged and one hadn t been put by. She was told they were out of stock and were due delivery on a Monday evening so to go back in Tuesday morning. Still nothing. We were told they were due in but couldn t say when  so my friend has been in every day checking for me. I was told they were out of stock  then I was told that store was due some but couldn t tell me when.  In the end I had to make the decision to get an alternative product for my daughter as you clearly weren t going to produce any.  I feel we have been sent on a wild goose chase  been made promises that haven t been kept and been lied to. Not great customer service from Tesco and I haven t got my daughter exactly what she asked Santa for Christmas.

Today she was told some items were unavailable so she has been to a Tesco store to buy them. She has come home disappointed as freezers & shelves were almost empty  & now nothing in her home delivery order is available. She can drive to another store. Many people cannot & if this is not a one off  then how many Christmases have you ruined this year? Surely accepting an order 2 weeks in advance should guarantee delivery. How can you underestimate demand to the extent of NO items being available. It s disgraceful & after years of shopping at Tesco  my daughter in law is upset  disappointed & furious with you.					2016-12-23T22:39:36+0000	1482532776	2016-12-23 23:39:36	0	6	1	1	8	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

When you mark up Ben and Jerry s ice cream in your stores as being on offer:  Any 2 for ¬£6 400-500ml ... It implies and indeed means ANY that meet the criteria I.e. 400-500ml  (certainly within in the display/freezer compartment).  What I was not expecting when I challenged your in-store customer services on this  was to be told it only applied to the  normal  ice cream. E.g. Not Phish food as I had purchased. Incidentally  Ben and Jerry s Phish food is clearly offered at 2 for ¬£6 on your website!  This tells me one of two things... A. This is a deliberate act to mislead customers. Or B. Your staff have received poor training.  Needless to say I requested and received a refund for the items  but this was a pretty irritating waste of time  as petty an issue as it may seem!					2016-12-23T22:12:04+0000	1482531124	2016-12-23 23:12:04	0	5	0	1	6	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They got him a toy to play with and a bottle of water. They were so understanding and saved me from having to go home with out my shopping  I wish there was more people like them in the world I wish I got their names.

I shopped in the Nailsea branch this evening  as I have ever since it opened. To do my Xmas shop I took my 17 year old son as I required two trollies. Having already put  boxes of beer  cider and wine in my trolley myself I asked my son to get three individual bottles of cider. My son was approached in the soft drink isle later on and told that he would not be able to buy the alcohol unless he had identification. My son stated that he was with me and that he wasn t buying the alcohol. My son fetched me and I explained the situation. Astoundingly  I was informed that because he put the alcohol in the trolley it was considered by Tesco s that I was purchasing it on his behalf. Consequently   I was refused sale of the alcohol and it was taken from me. I was then informed I could not come in to the store and purchase alcohol for another 24 hours. I fully understand why Tesco s and other supermarkets have measures to prevent alcohol bring purchased on behalf of minors however this was an utterly ridiculous over reaction with a spectacular failure to apply any common sense. TESCO S GET A GRIP  YOU DO NOT DESERVE MY LOYAL CUSTOM. STAFF TRAINING AND ADVICE URGENTLY NEEDED.					2016-12-23T21:00:13+0000	1482526813	2016-12-23 22:00:13	3	7	4	0	11	7	3	4	3	0	3	0	1	0	0	0	0

Today I visited Dover store to pick up from click and collect!! Usually we use the Folkestone store  but they were fully booked  so we travelled the additional 8 miles to collect our shopping! Well  we arrived and unfortunately our fridge items had disappeared... I want to say a huge thank you to Tom  who was on duty at the time as he searched high and low and made sure  along with his manager that we left with our chosen items and happy customers ... yes it took time  but we are patient people and can t see the joy in getting upset and Tom kept us fully updated on the status of our shopping!

Was told by the Customer Service person that he cant speak to the driver due to the fact he was driving (understandable) and was told I would get a call or message back.  Waited til 6pm then decided to go shopping to get the goods.    Around 7.30 the remainder of our shopping was delivered.   Im so annoyed that I have wasted my time and petrol.    What a wasted day.    Really considering using a different supermarket for my online shops.					2016-12-23T20:23:44+0000	1482524624	2016-12-23 21:23:44	1	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

Apparently a common fault with there hudle 2 hence why they have stopped making them (more hassle than what it s worth). After calling Tesco s technical support and them telling me to press a few buttons here and there the screen would light up but no android sign. The thing just won t charge nothing wrong with cable as I tried on my phone and that charges fine. They asked me if I had the receipt which luckily I found took a picture and emailed it over. I was told they would be in touch low and behold they rang today. To my disgust they said the tablet was worth ¬£0 and that it was out of manufactured warranty and if I want it repaired I would have to pay ¬£69..... no exchange  no money back  no offer of nothing. Well I will just make you aware TESCO that I have been in contact with trading standards about the matter and they have made me aware of you not following the Sales Of Goods Act 1979  Consumer Goods Act  Satisfactory Rights etc. I will take this further as I did not buy a throw away tablet. As for your customer service it is appalling very rude and unsympathetic. You could say I m a very unhappy customer and will be avoiding your store and products in future.					2016-12-23T19:45:57+0000	1482522357	2016-12-23 20:45:57	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had to visit FOUR Tesco Superstores across Liverpool today to get these products. Unbelievable that you wouldn t stock a basic product like Anchor butterp  and your OWN brand vegetarian product in the first three stores.   At the first superstore I was told Tesco had stock of the vegetarian product according to the computer system  so the guy went to check the store room and came back ten minutes later...  we haven t got any .  Didn t even bother asking for the butter as clearly stock control isn t a strong point at Old Swan.   Next I visited the superstore in Deysbrook. Same situation again  no Anchor butter or vegetarian product. Asked a sales assistant whether you had any other stock  his response was just plain  no . Didn t check your stock system at all  to be fair to the lad  he probably knew not to trust what it said.  After that I drove to the Allerton superstore. Amazingly they had stock of the butter! There I was getting quite excited thinking  third time lucky   walked over to the vegetarian freezers which were very poorly stocked of anything  as was agreed by another person looking for an out of stock item. I decided to buy the butter and go to customer services  thinking I d get more sense from them over the sales assistants  given my experience in the previous stores. I asked Paula if there was any stock of the  Tesco vegetarian bacon rashers . She didn t seem to understand what I was talking about as I had to go show her where they were meant to be  even though I told her the frozen Free From range. Eventually got back to the customer service till with the item label. She does her best  computer says no  impression   the system says there s none in stock and there s no further fulfillment date to say we re getting more in . So I ask is the product getting discontinued  she responded she didn t know.  I was utterly fed up at this point and asked her if I was going to get some monetary compensation for the fact I had to drive around three Superstores in a major city just to get some butter  and not have the vegetarian product I ve been purchasing for years. She refused  so then I waited for a manager. Sarah turns up  she was very apologetic but couldn t answer my questions about why management is not doing their job properly. I insisted that they pay for my petrol which Sarah gave me ¬£10 cash for as a good will gesture. I asked if there were any other stores I could guarantee to get the product from. Paula called through to Litherland which is all the way in North Liverpool (baring in mind I ve already driven from North to South so far in between Tescos) and they had four products to reserve for me. I accepted this and walked out of the store. Why didn t Park Road get called first? I advised Paula which area I live  so she must ve known that would be a long drive for me to go to Litherland.   When I got to my car though  I realised there was another Extra store in Park Road within 10 minutes of my location  rather than 40! And I wasn t about to trust what Tesco says to me about their stock. I m happy to say Park Road HAD THE VEGETARIAN BACON RASHERS!  WOW! I grabbed eight boxes as they seem to be like gold dust now!  Problem being this time... there was no product price label!   Now  being a major retailer  I m sure Tesco understands the Trading Standards rules regarding labeling being a legal requirement. It appears you can t even get the law right! I ve attached a screenshot for your info. Hopeless. No wonder your profits are plummeting because of competition from Aldi.  It s Christmas time  I know supermarkets are busy  however  it s not like we don t have this same holiday each year for you to expect and prepare for. Anchor butter is a basic item you would expect to be able to buy anywhere  and also the vegetarian bacon is YOUR OWN BRAND. This is also a seasonl product as it can be used for mock pigs in blankets  or with a Quorn roast joint. Tesco can guarantee I wouldn t have this problem if I was wanting real bacon  you can imagine the mayhem! Why should vegetarians be disrespected in this way?  I would advise you to sort your management  calendar  stock control and customer service out. It is shockingly bad at four of your stores. Oh  and I m reporting the lack of label to Trading Standards as I have photo evidence.   Normally I would have better things to do with my time  like wrap presents and get merry on a pre-Christmas drink  but my experience today has spurred me on.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q81/s130x130/15622532_10154975808180039_7425565902183113071_n.jpg?oh=74b9755ef93caed3f83cf6e7a4b7504c&oe=5920D614	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15622532_10154975808180039_7425565902183113071_n.jpg?oh=47cc2ddb8775599eca293b33a9531fd8&oe=58DDA500	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154975808180039&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-23T19:44:59+0000	1482522299	2016-12-23 20:44:59	1	18	1	1	20	18	3	15	16	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I update my shopping you tell me I can t increase the amount of some items  I assume this is to ensure you have sufficient amounts to supply your customers. So why when you turn up have you substituted lots of items on my shopping including items I ve been unable to increase with items which are totally unsuitable.  Since your shambolic delivery my wife has had to go to another supermarket to try and rescue the situation (the very thing we were trying to avoid) and will have to go again tomorrow.  My wife phoned to complain and was  fobbed off  with a ¬£10 voucher. I have since cancelled my delivery savour subscription and as we will no longer be use your poor excuse of a company. Please feel free to use your voucher for any purpose you feel suitable. If 10 years of loyalty is rewarded with a ¬£10 voucher for causing a VERY stressful build up to Christmas it is understandable why your profits are plummeting and why others like me will be spending our  hard earned  elsewhere.					2016-12-23T17:22:23+0000	1482513743	2016-12-23 18:22:23	1	22	1	0	23	20	6	14	16	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in your Greenstead store today and  other than being stunned that you had no Iceberg lettuce on your shelves  i was also a little miffed with your bacon... Everybody knows that once things are defrosted  you cannot refreeze them  right? I mean it says so on the back of the packaging... So why did i find a whole shelf of frozen bacon? Surely that means you can t freeze once purchased  right?... So who s to say all your other food hasn t already been frozen?...

We had planned to use it to make a goats cheese and caramelised red onion quiche but have now been left unable to use either the goats cheese or the caramelised red onion as the goats cheese is very clearly covered in mold and smells very gone off even though the use by date on the packet is January 16th. We have now been left unable to make the quiche for our Christmas party and have been left very upset and unhappy.

All very well and good when that is for the customer what you don t advertise is that you will skim off a little of customers money for yourselves. Burnley store today around 3.45 pm . My shopping was 21 something so I looked in my pocket only had a twenty and a ten so that is 30 handed that over . My change was only 3 something but how can that be 30 take 21 something is 8 pound something. I raised in immediately cashier said i only gave 25 which is impossible as had no coins and no fivers on my possession. Checked system and apparently the till was down. Not accusing anyone but someone has robbed my fiver . I am furious this close to Christmas and the sad thing is if someone had said i am a little short can you donate a fiver or something would have done so willing but to take my money and not give me a choice is disgusting .

My family told I was going to die). So  after such a bad year  decided to push the boat out and bought 3 trout from them and - I kid you not - they left them untouched. They came with guts  fish poop  stomach  heart  lungs  blood  everything. Yugh. Don t tell you on the website and won t take  em back.

There were a total of seven substitutions. When I commented on the number  your driver (who quite obviously couldn t have cared less) made the ever so helpful reply  you are lucky to get what you have  the shop s busy! . Busy? Two days before Christmas? No kidding Sherlock! Am I supposed to be grateful?  I am largely housebound due to my health. I shop online for a very good reason. What is the point of ordering online with Tesco who STILL can t ever seem to get their stock control correct? When items are substituted  90% of the time the subs so completely illogical that I often wonder if the online shoppers get any training whatsoever.  To add insult to injury  sell by dates are so often complete rubbish.  Thank you Tesco for letting us down yet again and even better that you have done it at Christmas (again). Time to choose another supermarket.					2016-12-23T15:54:35+0000	1482508475	2016-12-23 16:54:35	0	16	0	0	16	16	6	10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I ve been a delivery saver customer for about 18 months and order leeks most weeks. The large leeks on the left are the leeks I ve received the weeks I ve ordered them (I always order 2 rather than a certain weight)  the leeks on the right are the leeks I received yesterday on my Xmas food order. Now  they can really only be described as large spring onions and considering I have 7 mouths to feed on Sunday  I m not sure there s enough for everyone to have a  taste . This now means I m going to have to make a special trip to the supermarket so all my guests can have their leek fix. Very disappointing Tesco and this week of all weeks. From an upset leek lover!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15622443_10154820735189808_7557630758079280538_n.jpg?oh=4e2bb076b967ed5eb0272cb7993e39c2&oe=59180A5D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15622443_10154820735189808_7557630758079280538_n.jpg?oh=dfb12ddb650b22f1ff73ec575f3cabd8&oe=58EFBE50	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154820735189808&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-23T14:51:55+0000	1482504715	2016-12-23 15:51:55	1	4	1	0	5	3	3	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My groceries were delivered on time  but with several Christmas dinner items missing. I immediately called customer services who contacted the driver to arrange re-delivery. The driver returned and stated that he had delivered my items to another customer and although he had been back there  he didn‚Äôt have my missing items. He offered me a crate of items to look through for my items ‚Äòor something similar‚Äô  there weren‚Äôt any. He advised he would contact the warehouse with a list of my missing items and have them sent out to me today. I contacted Customer services again (10am) to ensure that this had happened - it had not.   Customer services contacted the store and called me back stating the items would be redelivered today and that the store would call me with a time slot.  At 1:30pm I had not heard from the store so  again  contacted customer services to enquire about my missing groceries. I was put on hold while the store was contacted only to be told that the store ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt have the man power to redelivery my groceries today as they already had 120 redeliveries from yesterday‚Äô. The customer services manager advised that my items would then be refunded.  I asked to be transferred to a team leader who advised he would again contact the store or try to have the items put aside in a local express store. On calling back  he  again  said the store would not redeliver due to a lack of ‚Äòman power‚Äô and that no local store had all of the items that were missing - what a surprise two days before Christmas!   Clearly  Tesco  you have overstretched yourselves and are unable to fulfil the orders that you have taken. Online grocery shopping is supposed to be convenient and stress free - it has been neither today. After one redelivery  4 phone calls and 6 hours of waiting  I now have to shop for my missing goods.  Absolutely unacceptable.					2016-12-23T14:46:23+0000	1482504383	2016-12-23 15:46:23	0	8	8	2	18	8	4	4	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	7	0

I bought 12 (yes 12!) rolls of this wrapping paper due to having to wrap up an enormous amount of presents. I struggled to wrap my presents last night due to the sellotape not sticking properly (I did think it was the sellotape but I sent my girlfriend out to buy the proper stuff but it still didn t work)...but with about half a roll on each I thought I d eventually done it. I got home from work just to find the majority of my presents completely unwrapped!!! Absolute nightmare!

The random extra packets of sausage rolls and pork pies you ve slung in though are a vegetarian s dream. Having to go to the supermarket tomorrow when I ve already paid you so I don t have to is a brilliant treat.

The guys there just tried to charge me ¬£30 to wash my car because it has bird poo on it ?!?! He said it s too dirty and will cost alot more than usual. I m absolutely disgusted as I think they were solely trying to rip me off because I m a woman on my own.   I wasn t aware there was a limit to how dirty your car could be? It probably would ve taken them a few minutes to get the poo off.  I understand they are probably a separate company but if they carry your name it s your responsibility to ensure they aren t ripping off your customers which they absolutely are.  Will never go there again					2016-12-23T13:40:16+0000	1482500416	2016-12-23 14:40:16	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So totally defeated the object of not going to the supermarket. What s worse is when the idiots at your Perivale/Greenford store do nothing about it.

I placed an order to be collected from my local store but after at least 4 trips and being told it wasn t there despite the paper trail I decided to call customer service - the original person I spoke with was helpful and apologetic and assured me that he would arrange a new delivery of the item and get it sent to my home address to ensure it arrived the next day. 4 days go by  no parcel or courier notes so I check online and my order had been cancelled and refunded!! This is where Ian comes in  he took my call whilst I tried to find out what had happened. Ian promised to look into the issue and call me back within the hour (heard that before!!) However completely true to his word  Ian called back and tried to explain what may have happened  we spoke at length about different options and how we could resolve the problem satisfactorily  but at the end of it all the item I had ordered had gone back to it s original price but was in stock - did I want to order it again? I had no choice  really as it was a Christmas present for my son so I agreed to re-order the product which I collected the following day.

I ordered a Christmas delivery for all my Christmas dinner items through Tesco online and before placing the order I called tesco to check EVERYTHING would be delivered as it was important nothing was left out with it being for Christmas. Despite being told I would be guaranteed everything with it being a Christmas slot I still had a load of food not turn up.   I hope all those people awaiting deliveries over the next few days are prepared to go the supermarket anyway as tesco have washed their hands of my complaint   can t find  my phone call where I was assured there would be no issue (despite me giving time / date etc) and told me that if the stock isn t in store on the day tough basically. So good luck everyone because if you have deliveries over the next few days I would put my money on it that there will be a lot of stock now unavailable and therefore you will be missing a fair few order items - but Tesco won t give a toss.					2016-12-23T10:55:05+0000	1482490505	2016-12-23 11:55:05	2	18	2	0	20	18	3	15	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wondering if you do something similar to Asda money back guarantee if not satisfied? We purchased the Tesco nappies for our 7 month old. They don t seem to suit him and have caused nappy rash. We did the 3 for ¬£10. Two packets are unopened so I assume we can return these? However one packet is open.

Sorry Tesco but this is the last time I do all my Christmas shopping at hours to suit me ... why .. because you are no longer a 24 hour store and  you could have at least had a night shift on in the pre Christmas week .. the shelves were poorly stocked and the Fresh produce was very disappointing .. no satsumas .. no pate  ... no prawn rings ... on top fo whuich it was very clear to see that  the floor wanted a good sweep and clean and staff were all pleasant and helpful but it doesnt help when all they can say is .. we are very sorry ...  what a let down from the main suprmarket.  please consider your customers and your staff.					2016-12-23T09:28:29+0000	1482485309	2016-12-23 10:28:29	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I originally bought it online at Tesco but now it doesn t appear in the search. Hipp advised me to go to one of the stores to buy it but I cannot get to your nearest store. There is no point me continuing to buy the product if it will be difficult to get hold of each time but I really like it! I am not going to buy the Tesco branded bodywash due to some of the ingredients. Cheers					2016-12-23T08:57:48+0000	1482483468	2016-12-23 09:57:48	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My nomination would go to the  little Tesco  store on Rawlinson Street  Barrow-in-Furness. All the staff from every level are brilliant  totally customer focused  extremely friendly and helpful  it s more like going into your local corner shop than a supermarket and much more impersonal than your bigger stores. Merry Christmas to them all and let s hope the store gets the recognition all the staff there so rightly deserve.					2016-12-23T08:55:36+0000	1482483336	2016-12-23 09:55:36	6	5	6	0	11	5	4	1	3	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wanted to beat the rush so left my shopping till late in the evening. On entering the store I picked up a self scanner so I could whizz round as quick as possible.... Half way round the store an announcement is made to say that the self scanning till would shut in 5 minutes!!! 5 minutes! I hadn t even picked up my brussel sprouts. I spoke to your  helpful  assistant on the self scanning till  I politely asked if perhaps a sign could be put up stating the hours the self scan is available as it s so infuriating to have only completed half of my food shop. Your  helpful  assistant told me (with the best go *uck yourself attitude)  that actually in fact it had been open for an extra two hours this evening and it s not a service that is 24 hours (despite being a 24 hour store) and there was nothing she could do. Then she turned her back and carried on what she was doing. So thank you Tesco  I ll be finishing my food shop at Sainsburys today.					2016-12-23T08:36:44+0000	1482482204	2016-12-23 09:36:44	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

He was asked for id and being over the legal age to buy alcohol  he did have id. He was with his 14year old sister  who was then also asked for id. As she isn t over 18  she has no id. So the sale was refused.  He explained that he knows the think 25 policy and as his sister didn t touch the alcohol or even ask about it  there was no proof it was a proxy sale  so there was no need to refuse it (this statement is in fact correct  I have done my think 25 Tesco policy training!)  Team support was called and also agreed that he was correct but she was refusing the sale! He said that he would just come back once he had dropped his sister off. He was then told that any future sales would also be refused! So I m wondering 2 things.. 1.. when does Tesco decide that they can refuse any sales to a person of legal age without any real reason?? 2.. when does being a team support give you the qualifications to decide how I parent my child and that I allow her to drink gin??? A statement that is wholly incorrect!					2016-12-23T07:46:20+0000	1482479180	2016-12-23 08:46:20	13	6	15	0	21	6	6	0	2	0	13	0	0	1	0	1	0

It was only 6 first class so I m loathed to go back or waste more money on calling the store as both would be more than the ¬£3.85 odd.

Never experienced any supermarket shop like it. After using aldi for the main shop i visitted at approx 9:30 tonight for my top end goods. Almost every aisle had new stock littered on both sides making it hazardous and very difficult to pass another trolley. Key lines like bread sauce and cranberry were either empty with replen stock on the floor or top shelf. I chose to unpack my own to glares from a colleague! Most of the staff were discussing how bad it was to work there and i heard one person so it will imrove in the new year. When arriving at the 2 open till points  there were huge queues. After 10 mins one more till opened and poor chanel had no keys. Apologising and hoping i would pay by card as she couldnt take cash. She was very pleasant but by the time i finished at the checkout the queues were down the aisles. A clearly more experiences colleague tried to get more tills open but said sorry hardly anyones trained and we have no where near enough people employed for xmas. Visible leadership. Nope none! Really really disapointed.					2016-12-22T23:33:15+0000	1482449595	2016-12-23 00:33:15	4	8	4	0	12	8	6	2	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please correct me if i am wrong  but having put my order in on the 26 November; I was not expecting any substitutions as this is ample time to order everything the customer has requested but obviously not.   I mean who actually wants shallots gravy well not me!!   So thankyou Tesco  I now have to fit in another shop to get the things you failed to provide. What adds insult to injury  is that due to the christmas period  I was told my refund will be delayed the absolute audacity!  I feel the whole charade has been a waste of my precious time. You may want to revise your slogan as this day in age every little does not help  and does not cut the mustard. when it comes to online shopping we want everything we have ordered not just a little of it otherwise we would not have ordered it in the first place! Note to self  lesson well and truly learnt.					2016-12-22T23:11:13+0000	1482448273	2016-12-23 00:11:13	0	8	1	0	9	8	5	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a grocery delivery from click and collect at your Batley store for 4-6pm. I arrived at 4.45pm with my 6 year old to collect my goods to be told I would have no paperwork for at least half an hour (so no idea of substitutions). I accepted this and started loading my shopping. I asked the member of staff where the rest of it was  as it looked sparse and i could identify a few missing items from memory. He rang to enquire  said it would be 10 minutes. I parked up and took my diabetic son for a drink and snack as he was feeling hypo. We returned at 5.45pm to collect the remainder of my shopping  paperwork now available - I discovered a good number of items still missing! The member of staff got the manager on the phone for me who  after listening to my disappointment  noted the missing items and promised them delivering out to me later this evening. Tesco ensured the items arrived 2 hours later  along with a sorry card  box of chocolates and small toy for my son - fantastic gestures! Could you please ensure the female manager in question receives a thank you from me and my family. I understand there had been a major issue with computers and orders being lost/wrong (and a fire alarm) but a desirable conclusion was obtained through going the extra mile. Many thanks.					2016-12-22T23:01:37+0000	1482447697	2016-12-23 00:01:37	34	11	35	1	47	11	8	3	13	0	33	1	0	0	0	0	0

But no  I wanted to go  I was feeling brave enough to risk another meltdown by said 3 year old...in public.  The meltdown happened as we were leaving your store because we took the lift instead of the escalator  (seriously) ...my son then ran in front of me to run to our car  crying and angry at the world he nearly ran into the road  I shouted... 2 security guards were standing in the car park and one security man called Richy grabbed my son to stop him running over the zebra crossing as a car was coming. His reaction was so quick and I was already so grateful...not only that they (I m sorry I don t know the other ones name) then helped me to load the car  talked to me to calm me down and we re so friendly and lovely and really deserve some recognition. üëèüëèüëè Thankyou Richy and other security guard for your kindness today.

But I don t understand why you don t want me as a customer? You seem determined to make me spend my money at my local Asda( which I don t like as much)  Last week you kindly refunded me and gave me a ¬£5 gift card after one of your rogue packers packed a pastry case at the bottom of a bag of tins on my home delivery. Yes I was disappointed but you did everything in your power( apart from deliver another one) to sort it out.  Having had my faith in you restored but with it being the week before Christmas I decided to take a chance and class the last issue as an isolated incident. So when I ordered my final Christmas shop I took the chance of ordering..... another pastry case. But this time I made sure to request that it was packed on its own and on top of everything else. Short of requesting a bubble wrapped parcel I thought this would suffice.  This evening a very pleasant chap delivered my order with the case indeed in its own bag  Please see picture.  I also have a snap shot of an Astro physics lecture. But I realise that delivering an undamaged pastry case is not Astro physics . I suspect  although cannot verify that your packers possibly do not hold a qualification in Astro physics. Neither do I may I point out  but I can certainly pick a pastry case off the shelf and safely get it to a destination so that it may be made into a delicious high calorie dessert.   I do not want a refund or a gift card or any other mediocre gesture of customer service  What I do want is a pastry case which doesn t have more in common with an apple crumble than the tasty backbone of a banoffee pie. Preferably delivered to me while I relax watching mind numbing Christmas reruns in my favourite chair.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15621578_10154860611569568_4290624962478530136_n.jpg?oh=e0c6c6f234bfea227cbee9473756dbcb&oe=591B1B79	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15621578_10154860611569568_4290624962478530136_n.jpg?oh=1dfb73c754139893c211960ef1f41e97&oe=58EE4674	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154860611569568&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-22T21:29:30+0000	1482442170	2016-12-22 22:29:30	5	9	7	0	16	9	6	3	7	0	5	0	0	1	0	0	0

I ve never seen so much glitter come off wrapping paper and it doesn t even sweep up  mopping the floor at 11pm last night still hasn t shifted it  it s on my sofa  cushions  rug  floor and somehow even made its way into the loo.  On handing out the presents I had to apologise to all of my team  all of whom didn t take their presents home so that they didn t spread the glitter fest into their homes.  I ve no idea why the glitter hasn t stuck fast to the paper but I posted the attached photo on Facebook and all of my friends who had purchased this paper have had the same problem  two of them binned the rolls after wrapping the first gift.  I d love to know if you ve had any similar feedback  in the meantime  have a great Christmas  mine will certainly be a sparkling one!

They re never late ....well stupid me selected click and collect (no idea why I did this! I never do!) So I frantically made my way to your Tesco Extra Excelsior Est branch  Cardiff.  Got there by 7:30..Click and Collect were closed. Ran to the customer service desk where I explained how much of an idiot I was to a very lovely lady. I then get a call from the Tesco lads who kindly said they d bring my food shop down to the service desk. When they arrived (after apologising and thanking them numerous times) I said I was going to get a trolley to put it in. They told me not to worry and they d bring it to my car. Some of my order was missing (I had no idea - they noticed)  so they went back  found it and loaded it into my car. I didn t catch their names  but they were both lovely  friendly and couldn t do enough! Even though I was the idiot! I was fully prepared for you to give me a refund  send me on my way and I d be desperately rushing around to get the Christmas food shop in time! Thank you to those two wonderful men who are great at their jobs!

Either way  our big Christmas shop was delivered on time this afternoon and we re really grateful for how considerate your staff have been with our items. Of the very few subs that were there all of them were replaced with items very much in our favour. The dates on everything also stretch far beyond Christmas day itself and we re really pleased with everything.  We shall remain delivery saver customers for another year. We ve never had any issues with your service and your delivery men and women have always been very friendly and helpful.  Thank you all so much.

We ordered online and the dips that arrived were due to go out of date within the next few days. Pretty pointless when we needed them for Xmas. Compare that to the Morrisons dips that I bought this afternoon....   And then there s the lemons that have gone mouldy within 24 hours. I know we re buying things out of season but this is just poor. Add to that we had a list of items that were unavailable  I m finding it hard to believe that Gammon joints were unavailable considering there were was a massive stock of them in Morrisons today and apparently plenty available when a friend visited Tesco yesterday.   I m seriously considering shopping somewhere elsewhere. Just because you have a monopoly on stores in Inverness doesn t mean you can take the p-ss out of your customers. This is just the latest in a catalogue of poor service and poor produce that we ve from Tesco.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15672838_10154681264171285_9097487412365828093_n.jpg?oh=57f2f4fbf9517e727ced24322361f7b5&oe=58ECBD36	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15672838_10154681264171285_9097487412365828093_n.jpg?oh=896cdeb1f83722154d5838e83f4d3a81&oe=58EC6F3B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154681264171285&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-22T19:23:12+0000	1482434592	2016-12-22 20:23:12	0	18	2	0	20	18	9	9	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

We have been checking every day for the past month so i would love to know how it went from not be available to pre- order to not being available at all in the space of a few hours!!!

This evening just before 1800 I went to your store in gaywood kings lynn.  I was in a rush as I was on route to work and my foot  accidentally touched the back of the heel of another person.  I automatically said sorry to this person to which they responded with  you will be if you kick me again   ...I was horrified by this remark...I was even more horrified when the person in question walked through staff only doors obviously he had jyst arrived for his shift and was going to drop his bag and coat off.

I bought 4 hot and spicy and 4 Chinese chicken thighs. They were very difficult to strip off the bone which I thought was odd because normally it s not an issue but when I got further down I realised why..... it s a tad pink. We ve never had it look like this before and we pretty much buy them every week. What s more disturbing is that apparently these were fresh out the oven..... maybe a bit prematurely?!?!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15590105_651941614483_9073452948853385071_n.jpg?oh=31168799bf702a4f816eb72e407f0460&oe=58EC4D23	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15590105_651941614483_9073452948853385071_n.jpg?oh=422df1a4663ca0135ddf7453491b3d20&oe=591E46AB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=651941614483&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-22T18:38:31+0000	1482431911	2016-12-22 19:38:31	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I was using the baby changing room at the Marcham road Tesco today in Abingdon  Oxford. As always  just like every other time I have been in there it was freezing again. Every time I have said to you about it  you have said they would sort the temperature. This is not being done. It s very unfair to change and feed a baby in that cold.   Also  when in there today  it was absolutely filthy. There were forty nappies left on the side. The changing unit was covered in muddy water. There was stuff all over the mirror. The floor was also soaking wet - not safe when carrying a baby. (See photos attached). Also  the cleaning rota on the wall has not been updated since the first time I complained about it.					2016-12-22T18:14:29+0000	1482430469	2016-12-22 19:14:29	0	6	0	0	6	6	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Because of this  we had to give up  waste my BEST friends ¬£5.50 and in fact just chinwag. This has left us high and dry.

Normally I m very happy and accept any substitutions. My delivery arrived yesterday whilst I was at work and my husband accepted it. Unfortunately chocolate rolls had been substituted for leave them for Santa chocolate rolls and Rudolph cakes  which just won t be the same to leave out for Santa. The finest stuffing substitute I received was also significantly smaller than ordered.  I rang customer services this morning and was told to return them to store as we had accepted them. I know this maybe the correct policy  but the whole point of delivery is not to go in store especially at the busiest time of year. I am happy to store the goods until my next home delivery and return them to the driver then. I am disappointed in customer service response to offer no solution other than go into store. Thank you					2016-12-22T17:12:21+0000	1482426741	2016-12-22 18:12:21	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had our delivery slot for 21st December between 10-11pm for a couple of weeks and when the delivery had arrived last night  about 95% of the shopping was not delivered  so a member of the store had arranged for the shopping to be delivered today between 12:30-1:30pm  but this time  the delivery was 2 and a half hours late. We rang customer services several times and the first time  the staff said he was on the way. An hour passed and no sign of the shopping  so we rang again and the same staff had said that he hadn t placed our groceries in the van (so  our delivery wasn t on the van  nor on the way). We are very disappointed and frustrated that this has happened. Also  we had a screaming baby waiting to be fed  for which his milk was on the delivery!					2016-12-22T16:38:31+0000	1482424711	2016-12-22 17:38:31	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently purchased 2 ride on tractors for my 22month old twins for their Christmas present. On opening one of the boxes I find half the parts missing... I contact Tesco to find out they are now out of stock....and the 2 suggestions are either go to a DIY store and source the spares(! It s part of the toy missing not just the nuts and bolts!) Or I could try and source a replacement myself!  Yes I m sure I could drag my very young children the length and breath of the south west searching for a replacement on your behalf 2 days before Christmas! üò° Very  very disappointed Tesco.					2016-12-22T14:45:56+0000	1482417956	2016-12-22 15:45:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I understand that this is due to  system failure  and you cannot unload any orders but I would have thought that a company as big as Tesco would ensure that systems were fully operational at Christmas. However  these things happen  and the lady who rang me was very apologetic. I would like to say that she was very polite and was obviously having a horrible job ringing everyone to tell them that their Christmas food was languishing in the store  never to be seen again.   So  whilst I have children howling in disappointment because their festive Pringles are no more  and I am now contemplating having to go to...shudder...Asda.... I wish you a Merry Christmas.					2016-12-22T14:45:36+0000	1482417936	2016-12-22 15:45:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After eating some of her toast my Mum looked up to see my daughter eating mouldy toast..... OMG!! Mouldy! My mother complains and the young lady says  i will get you more. No apology... she brings more toast and YES!!it s mouldy. Appalled that the best the manager  could do is say im sorry but the girl was crying.  Money was refunded but i will not go to the cafeteria again. Very poor service!!					2016-12-22T13:48:23+0000	1482414503	2016-12-22 14:48:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just been in your Winchester Avenue  Exeter store to do some shopping with the intention of putting items in the food bank and once again there is no presence of the food bank collection box/point.  Please can you clarify this is a logistic decision by the charity involved and not one by yourself.  I will be contacting my local food banks and attempt to clarify the situation.  Please can you just check if there is a food bank point permanently. Did I just visit on a day when it had been temporarily removed. Is it a choice by the foodbank charity to manage/withdraw it.  There is ample room in that store to permanently place one regardless of how much is deposited in it and there are many of us in the community who want to support it if it is present  especially this time of year under the current economic climate.  I simply wish to be reliably able to deposit items when I shop  I don t want to either know or get drawn into ins and outs or internal politics of the matter.   Thanks.

The children enjoyed the cheese on sticks. We were told that there was a grotto to visit so after we did our shop  we visited. After queuing for 20 mins or so the children were shy of seeing Santa  but the Elves and Santa could not have been more helpful. They took the time for us to have a photo  the elf sat with the children in the sleigh and Santa stood behind. They really couldn t have been more helpful  caring and professional. There was a craft table too and we took home some fab decorations. In the run up to Christmas this was such a thoughtful and welcome experience. I just wanted to say a huge  well done  and  thank you  to the wonderful people at Tesco Brockworth in Gloucester  I hope that this message makes it s way to those involved by way of appreciation. I will definitely be shopping here again!  No response needed.					2016-12-22T13:23:04+0000	1482412984	2016-12-22 14:23:04	5	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	1	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	0

Today I bought a pack of mint leaves for decorating my Christmas pavolva!   When I got home I went to put them in the fridge and saw this tiny little snail üêå peeking out! Love it!   I hate how everyone expects clean fruit and veg all the time (it does grow outside ya know!) and seeing this little snail took me back to my childhood when I used to search the lettuce leaves for caterpillars üêõ  and guess what guys nothing happened to me - I didn t get some weird disease  I didn t get sick or ill   I simply built up a good immune system all while learning about fruit  veg and the circle of life!   So thank you Tesco for not being perfect! I don t know why we all expect perfect food when we all live in an imperfect world!   This little snail is now in my garden üêåüòä!   More photos in comments for those who don t find this  gross !   Merry Christmas Tesco!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15665845_10154282673293196_5912538568967817349_n.jpg?oh=c7376a47946b8aa7bd73cbe337404199&oe=58E9570C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15665845_10154282673293196_5912538568967817349_n.jpg?oh=b575bf05cdcc8fde95191a5e57d1e2b1&oe=58E6D801	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154282673293196&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-22T12:36:58+0000	1482410218	2016-12-22 13:36:58	27	14	32	1	47	14	7	7	18	0	27	5	0	0	0	0	0

Kept tracking online and that kept saying it had been despatched and on way. With it still saying the same this morning I decided to ring to check as was getting concerned.  Will who I spoke to was lovely and rang the store it was meant to be going to. He then called me back explaining it had been lost in transit  he offered me a replacement that should come tomorrow. However  with it being near Christmas there is no guarantee. Very disappointed I wasn t contacted yesterday to be told the situation as surely it can t go unnoticed? Cannot find the game and dvd locally in time so fingers crossed it comes before Christmas as will have a very disappointed child.					2016-12-22T12:02:18+0000	1482408138	2016-12-22 13:02:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My mum visited your Bellshill store the other day with my 26 year old disabled sister in her wheelchair to do a bit of shopping only to discover that the trolleys weren t suitable for attaching to her particular wheelchair. Instead of coming home my mum took her and trolley into shop and broke her back pushing a heavy wheelchair and pulling a trolley full behind her and not one member of staff offered any sort of asssistance.  I find that absolutely appalling. The only help my mum received was when she was leaving store going back to car in which a gentleman who was a customer saw her struggling and took trolley to car for her. Really bad customer service....nowhere near as good as M&S where one of the stores employees went around the shop with my mum and a trolley and then helped pack her bags and load shopping Into car. Will be shopping in M&S in future. There customer service is far superior to yourselves					2016-12-22T12:01:13+0000	1482408073	2016-12-22 13:01:13	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not sure of their names sorry. My 21 month old grandson Tommy fell  and banged his head in the foyer of the store (little darling was doing a runner from me). I went to ask if they had a cold compress and they appeared with cooling pads  peas and sweets (which went down very nicely thanks).  Someone also found a local GP who was shopping in the store and he took a look at him.They were all so lovely and helpful. He s fine now but will probably have a nice bruise for Christmas.

Tesco Direct  you well and truly suck and I can t trust you to ever order from you again. I placed my order. They took my money. On Monday unknown to me they started processing a refund.

Today I get an email stating my  requested  refund is being processed. Two phone calls later I have no parcel to collect  a 5 (presumably working) day wait for my refund and a pathetic apology with no logical or reasonable explanation for their stupid lying system.					2016-12-22T11:04:35+0000	1482404675	2016-12-22 12:04:35	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

When we got home we realised the chicken goujons we bought (its a huge pack) go off today üòï  We are unable to return them today due to work festivities but hoping we could return them using our massive receipt tomorrow? We actually went through the till after 11pm last night so we havent even had chance to eat them. Hoping you guys can help.  Merry Christmas Kirsty and Lee (who incidentally got wrong for picking up said goujons)					2016-12-22T10:56:25+0000	1482404185	2016-12-22 11:56:25	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So as I sat myself on the floor  glass of wine next to me to ease the pain of wrapping present  scissors and cellotape at the ready.  I got started wrapping with lovely looking paper I d bought from your store.  Well it s like painting the forth Road bridge! Sodding cellotape doesn t stick to said lovely paper and when it does 10mins later it s popped off! I got about a dozen presents wrapped last night which took forever. Put them under the tree and low and behold they have all popped open this morning.   I am now going to have to go buy more wrapping paper and start again. 6 sodding rolls of the stuff I bought. It s completely not fit for purpose and I didn t have enough wine in the house to deal with its capers.  Oh and to top it off there is sodding glitter everywhere from it! My house looks like a unicorn has farted all over it! Merry Christmas Tesco.					2016-12-22T08:34:02+0000	1482395642	2016-12-22 09:34:02	5	10	9	0	19	10	7	3	8	0	5	0	0	4	0	0	0

Tesco you have for the second time this year with my second online shopping manage to disappoint yet again. Waited in last night for my online delivery - no call  no text  no email to say if it was late  if you couldn t deliver - NOTHING! I call you  wait 40mins to get through to someone to be told- sorry we can t deliver when we said we would (surprise surprise) and we can t contact anyone to re arrange the delivery. We will try to speak to someone tomorrow!!! Really Tesco? Is this the best you can do? I have 11 people to feed Saturday and guests arriving tonight and no food because I trusted you (foolish of me perhaps) to deliver at home all the food and drink that I need for the coming days. I have to work today and I am left with an empty fridge....and to all of that you can only say sorry?!???? Really!!! What about the fact that you should care about your customers and the promises you make and not simply be prepared to take their money? You re busy? You can t get to all of the deliveries? Well that is your problem and not mine - don t make so many slots available  employee more drivers and put your customers first!! I m fuming and so annoyed that now due to you lack of care and lack to provide a service I need to go to another supermarket at some point later tonight to try to do a shop that already took me hours to carefully  select on your website.  Very poor and I shall never ever buy with Tesco again! You should be ashamed of letting your customers down like you have!!!					2016-12-22T07:49:08+0000	1482392948	2016-12-22 08:49:08	1	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0

It s the only yoghurt my son eats and as a single parent and at ¬£1.75 a pack  I can t afford for 1 out of 4 to go straight in the bin! It s ridiculous! Get it together Tesco!

My mince pies (bakery fresh one) were damaged. They had worked loose from the plastic case they arrive stored in and we re loose in the carrier bag and are not edible.  Also most of my shopping was wet  seemingly by the smell it was covered in vinegar. Thankfully nearly every thing was in boxes or plastic wrapping but my fridge now smells like a pickle factory!					2016-12-22T07:00:27+0000	1482390027	2016-12-22 08:00:27	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our food shop should have arrived between 10-11pm which we paid ¬£7 delivery charge for that slot and it has not arrived! My husband phoned your Broughton shop where our shop comes from to be told it s due to the driver running out of time.

I ve just received my ¬£500 Christmas Tesco shop to find so many items out of date by tomorrow and well before Christmas. Am I supposed to eat it all tonight?   Would Tesco s personal shoppers take such little care and attention to their own shopping? I m disappointed and disgusted to be quite honest. I have spoken to a gentleman at your customer service centre and in his words he was  embarrassed  of this shameful situation. As far as I am concerned you can come back and collect the whole order - I won t be relying on Tesco again!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15541617_10211478052812761_4785771748736296062_n.jpg?oh=960264536c16e9fe3433b3f490a691d7&oe=58E82303	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15541617_10211478052812761_4785771748736296062_n.jpg?oh=b91eda460137e13904ff6c99a96b92dd&oe=591D3A77	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211478052812761&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-21T23:34:11+0000	1482363251	2016-12-22 00:34:11	8	30	24	0	54	30	17	13	30	0	8	0	2	0	0	14	0

I would just like to say a huge thank you to the lovely lady who has helped me in store this evening. I very stupidly didn t find out her name  and I m sorry for that  because she really does deserve recognition for her assistance tonight.  I did the bulk of my Christmas food shop this evening  but when I paid  half of the club card vouchers I have saved all year  didn t work. The till said they had already been redeemed. I haven t used them  so was more than a little gutted at the prospect of losing out on ¬£47.50 worth of vouchers coming off my bill.  The lady took me to customer services and phoned through to clubcard helpline to try and sort it out.  The lady on the phone was also lovely and did all she could to sort it out for me  but just as we were getting somewhere  the fire alarm in their building started going off and she had to abort my call.  At this point  the helpful lady in store said she would put the vouchers through somehow for me  as I had my children with me and there was no way of knowing how long we may have to wait for the club card lady to call back as promised  if they were being evacuated for a fire alarm.  I really am very pleased and have come away feeling valued as a customer.  Credit where credit is due. People are all too quick to complain these days  but not so forthcoming with praise...and the members of staff that helped me tonight all deserve praise and recognition.  Thank you. üôÇ Merry Christmas üéÑ					2016-12-21T22:57:09+0000	1482361029	2016-12-21 23:57:09	50	6	51	2	59	6	3	3	4	0	49	1	0	0	0	0	0

I received a lovely Christmas card along with my items; which inside reads  we hope you ve found everything you need to help make Christmas Special .  Well I thought I had  until I took the scarf out of its sealed bag you had sent it in  so I could wrap it up.  Upon taking the scarf out and giving it a shake to straighten out  what I thought was a piece of rouge wool fell off....... I was wrong!  On further inspection I found you had not only sent me my Christmas gifts but an extra  special  gift too. It seems what I can only describe as a baby wasp was trying to also keep warm for winter too.  I am pleased to report that the scarf is extremely warm and great for this cold weather.  But bad news  I think our little friend may have kept a bit too warm as he was a little dried out üôÅ.  Thankyou for sharing this  kind   if somewhat odd  special  gift this Christmas  but may I suggest in future you adopt the  not tested on animal s  ethos when testing the efficiency of your scarves Regards Claire üôÇüêùüêùüêù	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15590004_10158286773350221_2741029467766929418_n.jpg?oh=d102b3928885da7c28b7d211ee016194&oe=58E46403	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15590004_10158286773350221_2741029467766929418_n.jpg?oh=9ecadb2e525219f2acbd7c1e8411d9c2&oe=58EDEB0E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158286773350221&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-21T22:40:14+0000	1482360014	2016-12-21 23:40:14	1	11	5	0	16	11	3	8	5	0	1	0	1	3	0	0	0

Only part of the order arrived so I called yesterday to chase outstanding item.  Item was apparently  lost . After being transferred as it s an ELC order I was assured I would receive a replacement today via Yodel.  I was offered either refund or replacement but as I was promised next day delivery I opted for this. This has not arrived and I am becoming very frustrated now.  This item is a Christmas present for my Son. Just to add; Your customer services are very poor and I actually had to check I hadn t just called someone s house.

Phoned customer service who really was the least bit interested that I now have to go out and try and find alternatives to what I ordered. You think that by paying a premium for a christmas delivery and that it is only 4 days to go that you would get food in date. If you want one thing to go wrong with christmas then order your food from Tesco  I think I have learnt my lesson now and will never try and do a christmas shop with you again.					2016-12-21T21:04:41+0000	1482354281	2016-12-21 22:04:41	2	15	5	1	21	15	6	9	3	0	2	0	1	0	0	2	0

Tesco will remove this very quickly no doubt.   Ordered over 4 weeks ago and due to arrive between 5-6pm today. At 6.30  no delivery  so called help number.  Held in a queue for about 3-5 minutes. The lady I spoke to I have absolutely no complaints about at all. I was informed that my order was going to be late  approx 4 hours. So potentially arriving by 10pm. I  at this point had received no communication whatsoever about the delay.  When I asked why none had contacted me  I was firstly said that a text had been sent to my mobile number. When I said it hadn t  then was told that it was sent to my work s landline. Not possible  as nothing was recorded.   I spent  over the 2 phone calls  approximately 30 mins speaking and holding. I refused the offer of the order being delivered by 10pm  so asked for the order to be cancelled. It was a large Christmas order  so it would take me about 1.5 hours to unpack.  I was then informed that a van had broken down earlier. These things do happen  but I was not informed of any delay. I am distraught. Tesco did offer to deliver tomorrow  but I am away from home all day  so noone at home to take delivery. How could they possibly promise this  as they are fully booked and this would mean letting another customer down which  found totally unacceptable and unfair.   Tesco are refunding me the money already taken off my card  but was informed that this would take between 2-5 days to reach my account. Not good enough  as I know I can pay by BACS and the money is transferred  usually  the same day.  Therefore  I will now have to go out on Christmas Eve to shop and pay for another shopping  as the money taken by Tesco will not have been refunded at that point. The home delivery service was a treat so I wouldn t have to do this.  When I pointed this out the obvious problem  I was informed that it would take 2 days. Still not any good  re expensive time of the year. Money doesn t grow on trees.   I honestly think Tesco have over booked  putting money ahead of customer satisfaction and think they have the edge  as customers won t cancel their orders because they have no choice. We do have the choice.  Poor Tesco employees  - customer services  pickers  packers  drivers. All who have had problems today and I am only 1 customer.  Tonight the driver will have to unpack the crates and pickers will spend a few hours putting food back on shelves. Hope the frozen food is put back in freezers immediately or will not be fit to eat and same for fridge food. It may have to be put in a skip!   Not good enough Tesco. Bitterly disappointed. You have lost a loyal customer for good. Christmas plans have been spoilt at his end.  I had everything in hand and was starting relax.

Today I made the 25minute walk üö∂üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èto your Birstall express store in Leicester. Pushing my toddler üë∂üèºin his pushchair.  I needed something easy for my dinner as my partner is at work until ten pm this evening.  Imagine my delight to see my favourite pizza üçïin your reduced section!? My luck was in! What a bargain! üí∞ On the journey home  I fantasised about the carborific feast on my return. (30 minutes:uphill this time) My little boy woke up... demanding food immediately! So whilst he was restrained and entertained in his highchair.... I knew I had the 8 minutes necessary to cook said pizza and that would give me approximately 5minutes 36 seconds to scoff it whilst trying to avoid scalding my gob. But shock horror!!! When I opened the box and removed said pizza someone or something had gotten to it first!! üê≠?? Please see the attached photos!  Obviously not knowing how long the cellophane had been open nor what had removed my topping and part of the base.... I sadly switched off the oven and switched on the kettle ‚òïÔ∏èknowing dinner for me may not be possible this evening.... so I m blaming you for four things : 1. Making me hungry. 2. Making me walk for nearly an hour again tomorrow when I really really don t want to. 3. Me spilling my tea that wouldn t have been made had I been satisfied by pizza. 4. The inevitable weight gain by the chocolate cake and crisps consumed to fill the pizza shaped void in my stomach.  Sadly awaiting your reply......

One teeny bit of feedback for the Harlow Ed way store  could they try and use slightly more ripe bananas. Kids had one each today but they were almost impossible to peel and inedible. Ended up going in the bin  which is a shame. Plus it means you can save the less ripe ones for people buying  as I know I usually pick bananas to ripen at home. Would have mentioned something to them at the store but I forgot to be honest!

A huge hole in the back with wires exposed and a crack in the the casing  the top interior drawer not even being attached to its runner and the door spring completely ruined and sounding like it s going to fall off when you open it  whilst the door doesn t even shut properly. Blatantly been dropped somewhere along the way.  After countless phone calls  being passed from one person to the next  one company to another for the last 5 days  promised a new one was on its way by someone in customer service more than once  we re then offered an engineer to come and fix it?!!   NO THANKYOU!!  We were then told that Candy hadn t even had the damage logged with them after my call to Tesco on Saturday afternoon and can t deliver a replacement or remove the damaged one until the 29th December... so we re now stuck with a huge box containing a broken dishwasher in our kitchen for nearly 2 weeks until something can be done with it.

I ordered clothes for my son on Monday afternoon  with the promise if I ordered before a certain time they would be at my nearest store after 3pm the following afternoon (Tuesday 20th). I received an email to say they had been dispatched at 6.30am Tuesday morning. As of yet  5.23pm on Wednesday 22nd December they have not arrived. They are in transit apparently!!.

In the fresh food aisle there was 3 for 2 on party foods advertised.  But actually it was two separate 3 for 2 offers next to each other without clearing specifying that they were for different products.  When i queried why i hadn t had the third item for free it resulted in a huge waste of my time and two members of your staff who also couldn t understand it.  Once we finally worked out the problem I complained to customer service that it was misleading and seemed to almost be deliberately trying to trick people.  Whilst up until now I had merely been a bit annoyed   I couldn t believe it when the customer service lady simply pointed out that it was a tactic used by all the major supermarkets!  Nice!  Admitting you re attempting to con people!					2016-12-21T17:03:41+0000	1482339821	2016-12-21 18:03:41	1	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

Having put my faith in Tesco s to deliver my Christmas shopping  as a delivery saver customer I reserved my slot way back in November and have been gradually adding items to my order. I log in today to make some final additions to my shopping ahead of the delivery tomorrow to find several of the items are no longer available. In addition to this much of the Christmas range is unavailable too. To make matters worst I received an email advertising many of these product I cannot order. This is unacceptable Tesco s!

My 6 month old is due at the doctors at 4.30 so my husband was coming back to pick us up after delivery and take us there.  He has the car seat so we can t go without him and he therefore won t be there to receive the shopping. We ve wasted a whole afternoon together because of this.

I started my Christmas shopping in August  when you had a huge toy sale on. I spent nearly ¬£150  ¬£75 of which was my son s main present  a Ninja Turtles sewer lair. I collected the order on the 31st of August and immediately took them to a relative s house so that I wasn t tempted to give them to my son for his birthday  which I had already finished buying for.  Fast forward  I picked the boxes (2 in total) up from the house and opened them to wrap them last night and there was no sewer lair in sight. One box had 8 items in  which were dispatched together. However  the second box should have had two items in  as they were dispatched together  and it didn t. I wasn t given the ¬£75 main present.  I went to my local store and they called Tesco direct. I was told it was solely my responsibility and they categorically would not do anything. Just what you want 4 days before Christmas. I then spoke to a manager  who was just as stern  again  my fault. I believe it is fairly obvious the reason why I am only contacting Tesco now  but apparently that is my fault and my fault alone.  I ended up putting the phone down as we were going round in circles. Thanks a lot Tesco  one four year old boy s main present down.					2016-12-21T15:05:12+0000	1482332712	2016-12-21 16:05:12	1	4	3	0	7	4	1	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0

I usually like to go to the Celtic game then do my weekly shop in Tesco and thousands of other fans use the store before and after the game too. I also use Tesco in Renfrew or Linwood for my other grocery shopping on non match weeks.  I find this threatening letter utterly unacceptable.   I will no longer be using any of the above Tesco s and thankfully there is an Asda in both Linwood and Parkhead that doesnt send callous letters for using their facilities.   Might I suggest a review of this situation as many other Celtic fans are stopping using Tesco now not just on match day.					2016-12-21T15:02:29+0000	1482332549	2016-12-21 16:02:29	4	9	5	0	14	8	4	4	6	0	4	0	0	1	0	0	0

When coming to pay my total was ¬£11 extra then when I originally got to the till  by this point I had had enough and just wanted to leave because the woman seemed disrespectful towards me also dropped a lot of my products on the floor. When I got home I checked my receipt to see why it was extra I then noticed I had purchased a cd (which I new about) then rescanned it 3 times removed it once consequently I was left with paying for 2 cds but only having purchased one. I think this is disgusting as she made me feel like a criminal  when it is me that has been stolen from.

Cos as a customer who needs to use them often and unable to push myself far in a manual wheelchair it would be amazing to have the knowledge that I will be able to come shop in that store without the two scooters either being out of use  flat batteries or just like yesterday when I wanted to do my food shop for Xmas if they worked when you put key in  switch it on and press the controls. This past year so many visits have affected my health from stress anxiety and upset caused at this store. Even now I don t get the return phonecalls I get promised. I do this for all who use them and unable to request the help needed. It s getting beyond a joke now!!					2016-12-21T14:10:32+0000	1482329432	2016-12-21 15:10:32	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I asked the assistant he checked the labels and said  no we don t have any of those in stock  they are all ¬£9.45  - then tore up the cheaper label even though it was for the same bloody item!! He admitted the price had been printed wrongly. I always thought you had to honour the price on the shelf  but even in this season of goodwill to all men (and women!) he couldn t rip the shelf label up fast enough to hide the fact it had been printed wrongly!					2016-12-21T13:20:48+0000	1482326448	2016-12-21 14:20:48	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My mother ordered shopping from you to be delivered last night for over Christmas. Money is tight this year so she had saved her Clubcard vouchers for  The big Christmas shop . Both of us were really looking forward to having food for over Christmas. BUT she received a phone call last night to say that her shopping will not be delivered as her bank had declined payment. She was very confused about this as she had made sure there was enough money in the bank to pay for our food. The shopping had come to just over ¬£160  but was reduced by ¬£60 with the club vouchers that has been saved over the year. Tesco had told her that to make payment she would have to have the full amount the shopping came to before the vouchers being applied!!!!! This doesn t make sense as if you would go to a shop to have the exact same food and use the vouchers  you wouldn t need over ¬£160 to spend on shopping that only comes to ¬£100 with vouchers!!!  The delivery for the food was supposed to be between 4 and 5  Tesco had phoned at 3:40! in my eyes this is a very late to let your customers know that the food shop will not be delivered  and at this time of the year only being 5 days away from Christmas  this short notice is not enough. Now we will have to go food shopping in a mad rush to try and get some food for over the Christmas period. And with shops being manic and a stressful place to be in  the last thing I wanted to do was to go shopping for food  when it SHOULD  have been delivered to us.   This has left us both stressed  upset  without food and angry due to what has happened. We have always done our shopping with you  and we have always gotten our Christmas shopping delivered to us. We are not impressed at all with this situation.   So a BIG thank you  to you Tesco. Have a Merry Christmas  and a Happy New Year!					2016-12-21T12:54:00+0000	1482324840	2016-12-21 13:54:00	0	13	7	0	20	12	9	3	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	6	0

I have logged a return request to fix/send a replacement but the same was declined by Tesco outlet. I am not sure what s going on as tesco warranty is applicable for 12 moths from the date of purchase. How tesco can reject the refund without providing any reason. I lost all the confidence with tesco and will never buy anything from tesco. Can someone look into this on priority to regain my faith tesco? The return ID in ebay is 5044566601 and ebay ID is senthil_kumar_1979.

His name was John (he s a grandfather) and he was SUCH a lovely man! Deserved a medal for lugging my Christmas food shop up the path (I m catering for my sister s 40th on 27th so lumped that food in too - immense!). He did it with a huge smile on his face  a big hello  a lovely little chat with my 4 year old. He didn t rush me in unpacking and made sure I was really happy with everything. I only had 1 substitution out of 77 items (never have more than one or two on any order!).  When it was time to go  he asked me out of earshot of my LO if it was ok to give her a chocolate lolly as a little present  making sure she didn t have any allergies etc (he had fruit lollies as a back up just in case!). He asked if we had any more children and left one for my son as well. The nicest part though..... he d bought them himself to take out on his rounds this week for all the children  out of his own pocket!!  Please let him know how lovely he is. I did ring your customer service line and tell them what a great ambassador he is for your company but not sure if it gets passed on.  I presume he works in Pitsea store as I m advised that s where home deliveries come from to the Southend area.  Thank you John for brightening up my day!

We placed an order for the one present they really wanted back in October which was a trampoline   We collected this from the Brownhills store and took it home assuming that a top 5 retail giant would ship items correctly. A few weeks later for some reason I checked the box and found that the order had been picked incorrectly  The trampoline comes in 2 parts  box 1 and box 2 however rather than send one of each box they had sent 2 box ones meaning we had 2 trampolines but no instructions  safety netting or other important parts.  We took this back to the store and returned both boxes as advised (no problem  mistakes happen) expecting to receive a new trampoline.  When the new delivery arrived  again it was wrong ‚Äì two box ones had again been sent  Back it goes again  3rd time lucky!  3rd delivery arrived ‚Äì you‚Äôve guessed it exactly the same again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  Now I appreciate mistakes happen  we all make them  but to take the same mistake 3 times is an absolute joke  Now this is where I start to get really annoyed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  We are now being told the item is out of stock and have been asked if we want a refund. WHAT USE IS A REFUND 4 DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS?  I‚Äôve spoken to numerous people in the Brownhills store who have been really helpful  but when they ring to try and rectify it they just keep getting fobbed of  my fianc√© has rang the customer service line and again been fobbed off with ‚Äòyou can have a refund or wait till the item is back in stock‚Äô ‚Äì that‚Äôs great customer service adviser  are you going to come round and explain to the kids Christmas morning?  I‚Äôve just got off the phone to the head office customer service number  the guy I spoke to (Usman) was again really helpful and apologetic but couldn‚Äôt resolve the issue for me.  I‚Äôm now awaiting a phone call from Usman‚Äôs supervisor Nicola to ring me back  being honest I can see what will happen ‚Äì I will be offered a refund that‚Äôs if I even get a call  I‚Äôve suggested a simple solution ‚Äì if the 8 foot trampoline is out of stock  send me the 10 foot one ‚Äì yes I know it‚Äôs more expensive but surely ¬£30/40 isn‚Äôt going to hurt after all of the hassle I‚Äôve been through  Not once have I been offered any sort of compensation for the hassle I‚Äôve been through or the cost I‚Äôve incurred in petrol and phone calls  let alone the time I‚Äôve waster ‚Äì GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE‚Ä¶.  So Tesco  you‚Äôve got 3 days to avoid 2 kids Christmas‚Äôs being wrecked by your utter incompetence and also save a customer who spends ¬£400/¬£500 a month with you ‚Äì Do you think you can rise to this challenge ‚Äì Personally I‚Äôm not convinced‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  Finally Tesco  ask yourself this question‚Ä¶.What would you and your buying team be saying/doing if a supplier had delivered something wrong 3 times in a row and then weren‚Äôt resolving the issue in a satisfactory fashion?   #Tesco #Operationalshambles #whathappenedtoputtingthecustomerfirst					2016-12-21T12:08:23+0000	1482322103	2016-12-21 13:08:23	8	4	9	1	14	4	2	2	2	0	7	0	0	0	0	1	0

Some were noted  others were not. What is the point of trying to fit in a home delivery in time for Christmas (¬£7.00 reservation which was a bit steep even though it was booked 2 days in advance) and then having food delivered that won t even last till the big day. It s the 21st today and I have to use or throw lots of refrigerated food by Christmas Eve. This is becoming a regular occurrence now from this store. It seems that if you have time to go to the store then you can get really good use by dates but if you don t have the time to shop in store then Tesco use it as an exercise to clear their close to expiry stock.					2016-12-21T11:48:42+0000	1482320922	2016-12-21 12:48:42	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can t seem to find the number for your Wrexham store to ask (the big one next to holt road ASDA). My little one has come down with a horrible tummy bug  and is more than likely still going to be pretty weak after not eating for nearly 4 days  I was wondering if you guys had those trolley s with the larger seat in the front so that I can let her rest while i do my shop. She s 8  so she wouldn t fit in the normal trolley seats that fold out. Silly me didnt book a slot for delivery when they were open  so gotta do the in-person thing.					2016-12-21T11:18:06+0000	1482319086	2016-12-21 12:18:06	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I put my order in 4 weeks ago so why can t you do what Ocado do and see what s on the orders and order in what s needed. You substituted a gluten free Yule log with some chocolate brownies!!!! Seriously - how are we supposed to have that as a dessert on Christmas Day? I m so disappointed and too late to order from Ocado now or anywhere! I think next year you should look at what s in people s baskets and get in what s needed and if necessary keep it from being sold on the shop floor.   You won t miss my custom I know  but if there are other customers in my position  you may well be losing a lot more and you are already in financial difficulty- maybe this is why as you let customers down so they go elsewhere!!   And yes I could make the Yule log (got no choice now) but with a broken leg and having just had emergency head surgery on Monday I m hardly in a position to hence doing an online shop as I can t drive (as I m sure some wise crack will tell me to drive to the shop and not be lazy and to make the Yule log!)					2016-12-21T09:56:10+0000	1482314170	2016-12-21 10:56:10	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly I must say how impressed I was with the helpfulness / friendliness of staff and how all the shelves were being restocked to capacity despite the vast number of people in store. No sooner than I had selected two packets of pastry  was someone refilling the gap! Altho it was busy  the experience wasn t a hellish as id imagined! Your carpark on the other hand.... As mentioned in a mum of a small baby so spent 15 minutes driving around waiting for a mum&child spot to become free. You only have a few so I know it was a long shot! I gave in and parked in the widest spot I could find. Struggled to free the baby from his car seat without knocking the car next to me and went inside. Upon returning to my car I was now parked next to another car clearly with children inside (visible car seats & toys) and you ve guessed it  I ve been  dinged  while I m annoyed  I can totally understand how it happened so can t be too angry at that poor mum / dad. There I am  fighting and struggling to get my baby safely back into his car seat without causing damage and not one but THREE couples are retuning to cars parked in the mother&child spaces! I let the first one side  the second I shot a look and when the third made a comment about how tight the spaces were and to be careful  I d had enough.   It is when people park in the mum&baby  spots all the time  - I said with a smile! This Middle aged couple  no baby or child  were parked in a space specifically wider for loading / unloading small people  the 40 something year old lady looked and me and shouted  oh f*ck off  I quickly looked around in search of an employee or anyone incase things turned nasty but as no one was around I finished loading my baby and left.  I understand you can t stop these kinds of obnoxious  self centred people visiting your store but maybe some form of carpark patrol might be in order?!  You d be quick enough to ticket someone parked in a disabled spot without the correct permit  so maybe a gentle remind to those using the mum&baby spots that they are there to HELP mums  not save their nice car doors!   Mum & baby spots are hard enough to come by at the best of times I know  but a little consideration from others world go a long way for mums and their children.					2016-12-21T08:34:50+0000	1482309290	2016-12-21 09:34:50	4	2	4	0	6	2	2	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was in my pending orders the next day  and I know I haven t tried to make any changes to it  and I know for absolute certain that I had checked out before I lost my preferred delivery slot.

Not only does my bedroom looks like I have a fairy with the noro virus ( Gold glitter is absolutely everywhere btw) You would honestly need a whole roll of cellotape ( once you eventually find the end!) to wrap one parcel! It does not stick???? Even more stressed now Tesco and it could have easily been avoided with you taking the previously complained about designs off your shelves by now or do you not listen to your dissatisfied customers?

It was through a partner company who are allowed to sell on Tesco website. They are called Box.co.uk. I ve been a loyal Tesco shopper for many years so didn t see a problem with this  Tesco are a trusted name and I ve never had any problems with Tesco in the past. It was a click and collect purchase which was meant to be delivered to a local store. I had all the details  just had to wait for an email to say the store had received the item. On the day of delivery I received a call from the delivery driver of a well documented firm who s name begins with a Y and ends in odel. This was the first warning sign  how could Tesco use such an inept company to safely deliver their parcels?? The driver said he could not find my house... I had to explain to him that he was meant to deliver to a Tesco store and I would collect it. He said he d do it. I awaited the email to inform me that I could collect the item but it never arrived in my inbox. I decided to go to the store anyway  after all - I d been told by the delivery driver that my parcel would be delivered that day. Got to the store and they could not find the item. Another warning sign. I explained the situation  what the item was and where it had come from and eventually they located it. I took it home and presented it to my fianc√©e as her lovely new laptop for her birthday. She opened it up and switched it on only to find that the text on screen was Italian. Another warning sign. No worries I thought  just change the language to English. Well  the keyboard has numerous Italian symbols (letters with accents) and the other symbols (@  ?  etc) are all in the wrong place so do not correspond with what you type. I called Tesco direct who did not help in the slightest. They told me to  google  box. Box? I said. Yes  Box she said. It will come up on google and you ll have to deal with them. Another warning sign... I started to get a little worried. I googled box only to find hundreds of results which had nothing to do with who I was looking for. Another warning sign. Anyway  I eventually found their website. They don t have a telephone number for customer service  only for sales who do not deal with anything after the point of sale. Another warning sign. I read some reviews and immediately regretted ever buying through Tesco direct  I won t make this mistake again in a hurry. I eventually found a  call back request  form which I fully completed. This was over a week ago and I m yet to speak to anyone at box. I have however had email correspondence with someone. She emails me one day  I respond  then I receive an answer a full 24hrs later  then I respond and the cycle continues... Its been over a week and my complaint had not moved very far at all. She told me she s arranged for dpd to collect the laptop as they need to inspect it. Collection was arranged for Monday 19th between 9-5... My fianc√©e took the day off work but nobody arrived to collect it. I had to email three times to get a response to which they said  sorry about that . I have lost all confidence in Tesco and have had this foreign laptop (not described like this on Tesco direct!!) since 9th December. That is a complete disgrace. I have pleaded with box for a refund but they are not playing ball. I paid for it using my Tesco credit card and I d like a refund ASAP so that I can find a replacement laptop before Christmas. For anyone reading this  please be careful when buying from Tesco direct. You are not always buying from Tesco but from some cowboy company that they have partnered with. I m shocked that Tesco would allow themselves to be associated with these companies who s customer service is appalling  along with the reviews!!					2016-12-21T00:41:47+0000	1482280907	2016-12-21 01:41:47	4	16	7	0	23	16	7	9	10	0	4	0	0	0	0	3	0

Customer service can t offer replacement part or new bike as not in stock! After some persuasion I manage to get a refund  but does not really help me with the dilemma of having no bike to give my 3 year old on Christmas morning! Bought when bikes were on offer so I ll also be massively out of pocket having to buy full/overpriced bike!

I asked him if he would give them to a shelter or food banks he let me know that it was a against your policy to give away food that was not bought and now the bins that they are thrown in to are locked as to deter people from trying to do so. I am horrified at the fact that a huge corporation doesn t do anything to help it s most vulnerable members of the community when it clearly has the resources and means to; that a corporation would rather see a waste in food than see it s local people fed. Is there actually a policy on the preference to throw food away rather than save it for those who could use and benefit from it (referring to the assumed masses of food not just surrounding pastry goods providing it doesn t cause harm)? Thanks  Rachael.					2016-12-20T21:40:23+0000	1482270023	2016-12-20 22:40:23	4	10	4	0	14	10	4	6	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was left over 30 minutes trying to get some sense out of your so called customer services. I ordered my Christmas food over 2 weeks ago to be delivered tomorrow. I went online this evening to add a few items and when I went to click save changes  a window popped up saying I missed an offer and that the turkey I had pre ordered was no longer available. No email warning me of this. It was just co-incidence I was adding something to the order. When I rang the guy on the phone would not listen as he kept repeating that I had cancelled the turkey. I DID NOT CANCEL ANYTHING!! So now I m left with - will you deliver or not and will you conveniently forget to send the rest of the order? Thank you Tesco for completely spoiling Christmas for me.					2016-12-20T21:24:11+0000	1482269051	2016-12-20 22:24:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a baby bath seat - the front small box is the box for the product. This was placed inside a slightly larger box and labelled. This was then placed inside an ENORMOUS box for me to collect  with yet more cardboard and scrunched up paper inside. It was a PLASTIC bath seat - pretty sturdy and certainly not fragile.

Less than 24 hours and the issue was resolved. No less than 2 emails and two or three courtesy calls from your staff online and in the South Shields store to ensure I knew what had happened and that my delivery was now ready to collect. Fantastic service! I Don t know if you have any sort of rewards for your staff in place but David (I think) and the staff on click and collect in South Shields are fab! Thanks Tesco!

Particularly two members who were stacking the Christmas gift section yesterday evening (19/12). My mother works at John Radcliffe Hospital and as a last minute idea she was granted a budget to go and buy gifts for the patients on the ward that she works on. We spotted the Lynx Africa sets were on offer which were perfect and in budget so we cleared the shelf  when a staff member asked if we would need any more as she had lots more stock. We said yes please to some more and asked if they had anything for the females  as there was little stock out  she said that she would go and have a look. Two members of staff returned with a whole crate of Lynx and Nivea gift options. We took 20 of the Nivea gifts and 14 Lynx sets.  Would just like to say thank you to those two  unfortunately we didn t catch names but they were MOST helpful in providing us gifts and they went above and beyond.  Merry Christmas!

For the first time in a very long time I will not be doing my Christmas shop with you. I ordered my slot as usual to be delivered on Wednesday (tomorrow). I kept checking my basket and noticed every day more and more Christmas items were dropping off my basket. My ¬£120 shopping withered down to ¬£86. So today I cancelled it as I m going to have to buy most of my Christmas shopping in person I may as well get the lot in person!  I don t have a Tesco near me so rely on delivery. The closest Tesco is a drive away but with Sainsbury s on my doorstep I will have to go there.  It s a real shame because you usually offer such good service but this year you have really let me down.  A very disappointed customer üòî					2016-12-20T18:49:57+0000	1482259797	2016-12-20 19:49:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Next Ava walked us around the corner and showed us exactly what she meant some antlers that one of your staff members was wearing. We asked this lovely lady Ruth where we could buy some  Ruth hunted around the store to find some and couldn t find any at this point Ava was very sad.Ruth kindly gave Ava a spare pair of antlers and even posed for a picture with Ava.

I have been using these on my daughter for a long while with no problem. But tonight my partner changed her as normal and within 15 minutes every area the nappy touched was raised and red raw. For obvious reasons I will not post on here the picture of my daughter but I will be sending it to tesco head office. My daughter is noticeably stressed and irritated by the rash. No matter what we do it is not going or helping with her discomfort üò¶ if you have bought any recently I would seriously return them and I hope that tesco will look into this properly and remove them from the shelves before this happens to another child.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15622613_1273859645990641_5886061689177984437_n.jpg?oh=c93eadfca0a0f93171710c7e7f84ad2d&oe=58D8833C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15622613_1273859645990641_5886061689177984437_n.jpg?oh=a9c534522fa222381eac8c19bf010a8d&oe=58EBD929	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1273859645990641&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-20T18:31:41+0000	1482258701	2016-12-20 19:31:41	2	8	2	1	11	8	6	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This wasn t the case. On opening  the packet it cardboard sleeve  I saw a huge amount if cream sauce with very small amounts of beef. On tasting  the beef  I discovered  that the beef had the consistency of pre chewed  and spat out beef chunks  while the sauce was without any flavour whatsoever. I think dog food would have looked and tasted better. I hope you review this ready meal item to make it more palatable to anyone else that chooses this item for dinner.  I  am a very disappointed customer.					2016-12-20T17:45:04+0000	1482255904	2016-12-20 18:45:04	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This year we only had one small problem with the last order of the year  and it was solved almost immediately over the phone. We got a Card and a chocolate in the summer for our 100th online order. We always found an open slot for deliveries  and our orders were delivered on time and with kindness and smiles from the van people. Our lives have been easier thanks to this online shopping option  and the variety of items available have satisfied even some Mexican cravings like tamarind or raw monkey nuts to boil. We love both your Tesco Finest and your Everyday value ranges  and we appreciate a lot all the effort in logistics to bring everything together as a great service with great products and great value for money  special offfers  et al. The in store bakery is very good too! Please  dear community manager  extend our message of gratitude and admiration to the staff and directives that you get in contact with.  May all of you enjoy the holidays and get to celebrate with great food and smiles  as we have enjoyed all this year from you.

The deputy manager  (Becky Hendricks) made up a Christmas hamper for her and her family. This was such a kind and thoughtful gesture   it makes me proud to work with such a lovely person.

Glitter everywhere and sellotape won t stick to it so really useless at doing what it s supposed to. Surely someone can develop a glitter paper that doesn t shed glitter everywhere - can t use it for presents (even if I  could get the sellotape to stick!!) as the person giving and the person receiving it will be totally covered in silver glitter.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15622704_1595687757127950_7404296706866897086_n.jpg?oh=e490c14ed642b5a796e7aec0d3334dd4&oe=59203B3F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q83/s720x720/15622704_1595687757127950_7404296706866897086_n.jpg?oh=922bcb1a1dd90503dbb334303ed62388&oe=59213310	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1595687757127950&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-20T15:34:32+0000	1482248072	2016-12-20 16:34:32	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I always shop at tesco Seacroft. Despite seeing cheaper vegetables for Christmas advertised else where  I still came to you. BUT I am most dissatisfied that all your so called Xmas deals on vegetables where with sell by dates of 22nd December!! I as a loyal customer had to buy the more expensive produce which would be indate on Christmas day. Surely not many people cook a full roast this week on the lead up to Xmas?					2016-12-20T15:32:25+0000	1482247945	2016-12-20 16:32:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The order has been cancelled in writing and on the telephone as 28th December is not before Christmas as you seem to think.  Before Christmas 2017 maybe but we need an oven this year.  Anyway what makes you think you will get away with keeping the money if you have not supplied the goods which you have admitted???  A dispute has been raised with Barclaycard regarding the charge and their legal dept are on the case meanwhile I am also going to report you to Trading standards and ActionFraud.					2016-12-20T15:28:45+0000	1482247725	2016-12-20 16:28:45	1	16	2	0	18	16	4	12	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

No delivery came. A whole hour and 22mins after my delivery slot I received a phone call to say that the driver hadn t turned up. I was offered a reschedule to then be told there were no more slots until after Christmas  my only option was a refund and a good will voucher of ¬£15. I wasn t offered the option on pick and collect at my local store! My reason for ordering online is because I m 38 weeks pregnant and I m having hip pain  not so easy to walk and do a food shop! I was left with no shopping and having to wait up to 3 days for my refund. Pretty poor customer service  why wasn t I called before my scheduled delivery slot? I used to work in retail and know that a driver has to be there well before his/her first drop to do van checks and then load. Instead of calling before they left it until 9:22pm. Unacceptable. I wasn t called then until mid Monday morning to say a special van would be coming out to deliver my shopping. Same delivery slot  it then was 15mins later than my allotted time! I ve been charged a further ¬£2.00!! And not forgetting I m actually missing 2 items from my shopping! Not happy at all! You need to sort your customer service management out! A call should have come out before my delivery slot and I should have at least been offered pick and collect! Not so sure I trust to use your services again!					2016-12-20T14:26:48+0000	1482244008	2016-12-20 15:26:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know that onion is a lot cheaper than brie so i guess this is your way to make a bigger profit but I think its crappy.   I generally love your food and this was supposed to be my Christmas treat.

With the easy pull to open and peelable lid I can imagine it being really good for elderly or someone who is struggling to cater for them self but still wants independence so well done tesco!					2016-12-20T13:44:59+0000	1482241499	2016-12-20 14:44:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Haven t compared every item in the store  but the online price is also 30p per packet. It s not much of a difference  I agree  but shouldn t really happen in a trader with their reputation for quality and pricing competitiveness.					2016-12-20T13:22:30+0000	1482240150	2016-12-20 14:22:30	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I couldn t find one boxed  I looked round for someone to assist me. After going round the entire top floor twice  in my wheelchair  I joined the queue at the tills where I was told that there was no one else. The assistant closed her till and came with me to try to find a coffee machine. She eventually went to the store to try to locate one but returned to say there were none in stock. Why are items on display if they are not available? I know I could have tried online but I didn t want to do that. Last time I ll be going to that store. I ll get my coffee maker elsewhere. Bad service.					2016-12-20T13:08:11+0000	1482239291	2016-12-20 14:08:11	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A lovely soft loaf that was very reasonably priced at 55p. But over the last few weeks it has changed for the worse. Its not lovely and soft anymore and tastes more like the value bread or 3 day old bread when I have just bought it.

I m not happy with the fact that an order I placed for a phone was cancelled by your system but that I was not informed of this  instead  receiving a  track your order  email from yourself. Then I had a problem with your phone enquiry line because it takes absolutely ages of clicking through all the available options (up to 10 choices) before I could even speak to anyone about it  & the first person couldn t even locate the order. I  then went online to check myself  & found out that my order that I have been waiting for since 30 Nov had been cancelled. Why didn t the first person find that information for me? I rang again & clicked thru all the options to speak to someone who put me on  hold for more than 5 minutes. I rang again & went thru all the options and the woman I spoke to could see the cancelled order - she was the one who confirmed that the order was cancelled by the system  but she couldn t tell me why Tesco had not  informed me of the cancellation. She recommended I went into the store to buy the phone & put me through to the phone shop but it was reverting to the Tesco mobile line. When I rang customer services (all I wanted to do was check whether the phone I wanted was in stock  she said  well it is a week before Christmas.  I know that. But I ordered my phone in Nov! She could not get through so I have now to go into the shop (a week before xmas) not knowing if  the phone is in the shop.1 1/2 hours wasted & there isn t enough space here 2 mk cmplnt!					2016-12-20T11:14:18+0000	1482232458	2016-12-20 12:14:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an order for home delivery and as soon as I paid (part debit card  part clubcard vouchers)  got a message saying the items wouldn t arrive when I wanted them. Immediately phoned to cancel or change the order to collection but your staff couldn t help me. I cancelled the order myself  and understood the refund of cash and vouchers would take place in 3-5 working days. In the meantime  I reordered items and have since collected these.   So.....today  9 working days later  still no refund. Your member of staff today has been helpful  and found that in fact the funds were never claimed by Tesco  but are still held as  reserved  at my bank. I have lost my clubcard vouchers until Feb 2017  so a refund of the amount spent on them has been made. The bank are being asked to release my funds....all because  apparently  I cancelled TOO QUICKLY!  I m told that the money will be back with me today or tomorrow  and that I will be reimbursed for the cash value of the vouchers I used (but not their enhanced value if used on certain offers). It hasn t left me feeling very Christmassy  I m afraid. As you like to say   every little helps  (what DOES that mean?) perhaps someone in your customer relations department might have something to make me feel a bit less disgruntled?					2016-12-20T11:04:04+0000	1482231844	2016-12-20 12:04:04	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Lucky enough I had enough money to cover the second ¬£90 but this is unacceptable! You have left me out of pocket (I have only ¬£10 left in my main account and have a bill to pay) on the run up to Christmas because your system has taken two payments from my bank account. I have to wait 24 plus hours to get my ¬£90 back but this should not be happening to your customers as we shop with you online and in store with confidence. I have informed my bank account and have informed Tesco of the error. I want people who shop with you to be wary of your system at the moment as fee s could be applied to those who end up in unplanned overdrafts when money is taken when it shouldn t be.

This service is meant to make life a little bit easier not cause more problems.  Ordered a turkey crown  only by chance I went back on Saturday to add something else to my order to find they d took it out of my basket as non available so added more things to my order instead to take me over ¬£40 so service was free collected my order to find they d added 2 smaller turkey crowns instead (which I didn t want) these turkey crowns were ¬£9 each so ¬£18 for both looked at my receipt they d charged me ¬£23 for them and put pricematched as this was the price of the original turkey  told me they d refund that off my bill instantly  then found out they d not took off ¬£28.15 in clubcard vouchers and e-coupons  said they couldn t sort that I d have to ring up Tesco.com so ¬£73.45 went out of my bank this morning instead of ¬£22.30  got the refund for vouchers and coupons this morning but hadn t even sorted ¬£23 refund for turkey so 2 phone calls later I m out of pocket till it s sorted!!! Really not good service Tesco and I won t be using again!!!!			http://tesco.com/	tesco.com	2016-12-20T09:48:01+0000	1482227281	2016-12-20 10:48:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Had tried your festive Wellington a week or two ago and for the first time in a long time I was looking forward to Christmas dinner. Till I went to my Fraserburgh store and they informed me it has been discontinued. I don t understand why you would remove one of a few vegetarian options just a week before Christmas.					2016-12-20T08:44:52+0000	1482223492	2016-12-20 09:44:52	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last year I spent a small fortune buying a Christmas turkey from you and was so suprised that so many were not British!  I think this is disgraceful our British farmers need much more support.  When I did find one it cost me nearly ¬£40.  Yesterday I went to a different supermarket  (currently has a advert about their turkeys never from prisons ) I would have been hard pushed to find a turkey that needed a passport !! Excellent turkeys. Mine was British free range and local! And HALF THE PRICE !!  COME ON TESCO SUPPORT BRITISH FARMERS!!					2016-12-20T07:14:09+0000	1482218049	2016-12-20 08:14:09	4	3	4	2	9	3	2	1	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I just have to mention a lovely man at your Watford Extra named Zoran who impressed my wife and I with his willingness to help us search around the store for some sugar free biscuits. He was incredibly helpful and polite and is a credit to your company. :-)					2016-12-20T06:43:54+0000	1482216234	2016-12-20 07:43:54	3	5	3	0	8	5	2	3	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Everything was in our order which was great. However  we did order the Belgium chocolate cheesecake which specifically says on your website lasts 4+ days. The one we received however  had a use by date of today! Bearing in mind our delivery was at 10 pm  we weren t planning on having a midnight feast on chocolate cheesecake but rather an early Christmas celebration with my elderly grandmother who was very intrigued by the fact that you can get cheesecake AND chocolate together! Needless to say she was rather looking forward to it! I will now endeavour to get her another one before our celebration but a refund would be much appreciated! üéÑüç∞P.S not to mention it was a bit knackered too!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15578452_10154820975317173_2704262434857816446_n.jpg?oh=8c43a95d679ad8d856b60659a3137e2c&oe=58E7702E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15578452_10154820975317173_2704262434857816446_n.jpg?oh=3e958db1a1c86e78fdf3ef9c9ebbbb4f&oe=591CDA23	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154820975317173&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-19T22:24:01+0000	1482186241	2016-12-19 23:24:01	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered the beef Chianti main  sprout  cabbage and pancetta side and cherry chocolate cheesecake for dessert.  I ve always enjoyed the meals in the past but I have to say that this time I was very disappointed.  The beef was fatty and had no texture and didn t seem to have any seasoning at all. The brussel sprouts were very bitter and the cabbage was just mush really. The cheesecake had hardly any cherries in it.  All in all a big disappointment.					2016-12-19T21:42:46+0000	1482183766	2016-12-19 22:42:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She had to go herself get my dad then they both found local police men and still you did nothing. Totally disgusting. She s 87 and was shocked and upset and you didn t even help her and told her she couldn t take her shopping till she d paid.

I bought a Connect 9 tablet from my local Tesco  and I am pleased with the tablet  and how it functions  etc.  I am not pleased with the ordeal I am going through to buy a suitable case for it  however.  I have bought various cases that claim to fit the tablet  but none of them have fitted thus far.  When I buy a new mobile phone or tablet  I always like to buy a suitable case for them  to keep them pristine  and prevent scratches  bumps  etc.  When I bought my Tesco Hudl 2  I was able to buy a case with no problem; so why is buying a case for my Windows tablet so difficult?					2016-12-19T20:49:31+0000	1482180571	2016-12-19 21:49:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a recurring customer I demand the option to select what fruits and veggies I want  and as a responsible and conscious consumer I want to see that your company cares for the environment and reduces the use of unnecessary plastic packaging.   To all my UK friends: If you feel as disgusted and sad as me at this sight  please share this post and be more vocal about your disapproval about the overuse of plastic in the supermarkets.  The photos were just taken an hour ago at Tesco Newmarket.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15492516_10105148171943987_6213781754726413337_n.jpg?oh=0a5b78e4d4f994769143cc88d35b6fb6&oe=58EF8CCF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15492516_10105148171943987_6213781754726413337_n.jpg?oh=b41aefd9444859a087f52f6eb853461c&oe=592428C2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10105148171943987&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-19T20:37:46+0000	1482179866	2016-12-19 21:37:46	4	3	7	5	15	3	1	2	0	0	4	0	0	0	3	0	0

The lady on customer service - Sue - has been extremely helpful! She checked the system (as google said you did 1) but had no luck  so she came with me to help me find 1  asked an employee from the chiller department who answered us straight away that the store doesn t stock them  so pointed us to the right place for dairy free cheese! Sue came with me to get it and even recommended a pizza sauce topping from your free from section and again took me there. She then took me back to her till so I didn t have to queue again. I really am happy with the customer service I received! Sue was fantastic!  Well done Tesco!					2016-12-19T20:30:44+0000	1482179444	2016-12-19 21:30:44	5	7	5	0	12	7	7	0	4	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only did you do nothing when my 87 year old gran had her bag stolen. You couldn t be bothered to ring the police  or check cameras or even go outside to get my dad for her!!!!! She had to go herself get my dad then they both found local police men and still you did nothing. Totally disgusting. She s 87 and was shocked and upset and you didn t even help her and told her she couldn t take her shopping till she d paid. Merry Christmas.					2016-12-19T20:07:06+0000	1482178026	2016-12-19 21:07:06	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Imagine my despair then  when I tore open the pack in eager anticipation  only to be met by 24 rolls of sub-standard and irritation-inducing wafer thin paper offering the kind of experience one would expect from a festival toilet or perhaps a motorway service station. The reality has hit hard  leaving me with a terrible sense of disappointment in what had promised to be a superior product  the impending doom of the knowledge that my family and I now have to experience 24 rolls worth of discomfort using said product and the discontent at having paid several hard earned pounds for the privilege of doing so. I urge you Tesco  to review this product urgently  in case an unfortunate mix up has occurred whereby the actual  Luxury Soft Toilet Tissue  has been mixed up with  Tesco Baking Parchment  or  Tesco Parcel Wrap . That  or rename it to a more befitting label - perhaps  Tesco Basic Scratchy Toilet Tissue ?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15589937_10154562838575342_2279715486003804736_n.jpg?oh=6d37dba85ad6a0f80a45c447a4b19462&oe=58DCA4AC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15589937_10154562838575342_2279715486003804736_n.jpg?oh=86d76371cfb00973ec7c32f5458037e2&oe=58D6A0A1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154562838575342&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-19T20:06:01+0000	1482177961	2016-12-19 21:06:01	5	22	9	1	32	22	7	15	11	0	5	0	0	4	0	0	0

This heater had been plugged in and running for 90 minutes and on unplugging it one of the pins from the plug remained in the socket and the damage to the wire and plug is evident	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15665479_10153976360576594_3779832623399722923_n.jpg?oh=7e0ea8d4895da015f2e84a6d878aec32&oe=591BD4F4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15665479_10153976360576594_3779832623399722923_n.jpg?oh=26548d3ee63a7f330f533bde6d537349&oe=58EB05F9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153976360576594&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-19T18:28:45+0000	1482172125	2016-12-19 19:28:45	1	8	2	2	12	8	6	2	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

How could you design such cute wrapping paper.  With its cute reindeer and pretty sparkles  I fell for its charms.  This year with 3 older teens and a 4 year old to keep in suspense for their Christmas gifts  I decided I would wrap all present in the same gorgeous paper.  Well....now I fully regret my choice and wish I had not been lured in to the glittery trap.  I made the error of wrapping presents on my bed...huge mistake.  My room looked like an explosion in a glitter factory and even though I washed the covers and hoovered  yes hoovered my bed...my husband and I woke in the morning looking like Bradley and Ottavio from X-Factor.  I then had to do the school run and shopping with a very sparky face before I could even attempt to wash it off in the shower.  And that was only round one.  Round two  I thought I d put a sheet down first.  It saved the carpet but on shaking the sheet out side  I panicked that I would confuse dear old Rudolph himself into thinking Santa s clock might be late.  It s in my eyes  Tesco.  It s on my clothes and just about everywhere I look.    And guess where I work and what I have to sell everyday...TESCO!!! what strength it takes not to scream   DONT DO IT.  STAY AWAY FROM THE SPARKLES  to every customer that falls for its beauty.  I shall send you a bill for the extra washing and hoovering for both wrapping sessions and ...  OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  IT S ALL GOT TO COME BACK OFF ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  AHHHHHHHGGHHHHHHH!!!!!					2016-12-19T18:11:49+0000	1482171109	2016-12-19 19:11:49	392	523	650	66	1239	513	305	208	352	0	391	19	1	234	2	1	0

I noticed that the menu had changed and sausages weren t an option but did notice that on the kids menu  you offered burger chips and peas. You also offered a full all day breakfast including sausages on the main menu. As my son is a fairly fussy eater and specifically asked for sausages  I asked the gent at the till if I could swap the burger for sausage(s) and got quite a blunt  no  in reply. He explained that till has no option to make changes to the meals and quite clearly wasn t prepared to speak to the chef to ask to ask the for sausage instead. I was really quite shocked that he refused to make the swap. I wasn t asking for anything for free and I was only asking for something that every other supermarket cafe does accommodate. Essentially  no parent can buy sausages for their children despite them having sausages available  or make any amendments to any meal on the menu due to the till. The gent I happened to speak was called Jason and his name badge stated he was the manager. I am surprised he will have any customers in his cafe if he speaks to customers the way I was spoken to. Needless to say  you won t be getting any further custom from me based on the poor menu choice and customer service.					2016-12-19T17:51:49+0000	1482169909	2016-12-19 18:51:49	0	7	0	0	7	7	4	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Following waiting 2 weeks for the item below to come back into stock  and after receiving a stock alert email to confirm  I purchased on 17/12/16.   I collected my parcel from a Tesco express today 19/12/16 excited at the thought of seeing my sons face Christmas Day.   I opened the parcel to discover a Thomas the Tank engine play mat! Not even close to what I ordered.   Following a call to Tesco I was informed the item I ordered was again out of stock and no date of when this would be available üò° I was advised to return the wrong item back to Tesco store. Ohh and a sorry was tagged on to the end.  I drove back to Tesco express to return the thomas play mat to be informed they can t accept returns at that store. At this point I m now fuming.  So all in all Tesco are totally incompetent and I m disgusted at the fool that decided a thomas play mat was a good substitute for a bloody easel...

Rang your customer helpline who have said because we are staff members we have to talk about it to manager.

I was due to have my shopping delivered this morning between 9-10 but I received a phone call to say my card had been declined. I got straight on the phone to my bank only to discover that someone had not only taken a large loan out in my name but had also spent it all plus everything that was in my account all within 24 hours! I spoke to Janet afterwards to explain the situation but never expecting for one second that they d still be able to get my shopping to me today  but that s exactly what they did! On what must be your busiest week of the year the team still pulled out all the stops to make sure I got my groceries! So please please please pass on my thanks to Janet and the delivery driver  I didn t catch his name but he not only brought my shopping but these flowers and bubbly stuff too. Its been a miserable morning but I am massively grateful  thank you all so so much.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15589813_10154042312776776_8147426891405300747_n.jpg?oh=8d525bf880dd5483bdf681cbaa16d6da&oe=58DDB19F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15589813_10154042312776776_8147426891405300747_n.jpg?oh=460f30bd7b17532e407ca4942d06cebd&oe=591C7292	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154042312776776&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-19T14:24:52+0000	1482157492	2016-12-19 15:24:52	804	45	876	61	982	45	30	15	99	0	798	64	8	0	0	0	0

I paid for my order using the bt rewards pre paid card which Tesco authorised as valid when I placed my order! My order was due between 1-2 today! I received a phone call at 1.45 saying my card wasn t allowing payment! This was because your system wasn t taking the amount of offers/vouchers off before putting payment through therefore the amount was over the amount on the card! There is enough money on the card to cover the cost of my order that was placed but I am now not receiving my order because of this! I shouldn t have been allowed to place the order if that was the case! So now what am I supposed to do Tesco? This was my Christmas food! It s now the 19th December and there are no delivery slots left! Thanks!					2016-12-19T14:03:44+0000	1482156224	2016-12-19 15:03:44	0	20	0	0	20	20	15	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At ¬£10 I expected a decent cake but it tastes of nothing  dry chocolate cake covered in oversweet flavourless icing. I was immediately suspicious when my 9 year old son didn t even finish his piece!

We purchased an Acer tablet last year and what a mistake. Had nothing but problems with it. Tescos didn t want to know kept being told to contact Acer direct who were useless. Back and forwards this tablet has been sent and supposedly repaired and again same fault occurred. After composing tescos finally agreed to help but instead of getting me a replacement or getting it fixed properly I have been offered a partial refund so now out of pocket and have to purchase another one.  Not impressed and will not be buying anything else from them. Appalling customer service!!!!!!!					2016-12-19T11:55:11+0000	1482148511	2016-12-19 12:55:11	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in your store very recently (Blandford Forum super store).  I was horrified  (and trust me  not a lot rattles my cage ) to see that the AED (automated external defibrillator)  fitted inside the store  has been blocked off by a huge Christmas tree and  a charity collection box.  What on earth is the thinking in this?? This piece of life saving equipment has been virtually forgotten behind a huge box and a tree. I was filled full of dread. There were staff about but I just couldn t speak as I wanted to be taken seriously. So I m here :) If someone suffers a full cardiac arrest  you have four minutes before they ll suffer brain damage. Ten minutes before they are unsavable. CPR alone will not save a person s life. It s called basic life support for  a reason. It will support basic function  but without an ambulance  a paramedic  or a member of the public using one of these AEDs  (which thankfully you need no training for  as it will walk the user through) someone will die.  I know these AEDs have saved lives where otherwise there would have been no hope. Please  please  please get the tree and other things out of the way.  You wouldn t put a tree in front of a fire exit (I d hope!) This is the same.  Please sort it out <3 (Happy Christmas xxxxxxx)					2016-12-19T07:30:27+0000	1482132627	2016-12-19 08:30:27	8	5	8	1	14	5	3	2	4	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a disability so it s not easy for me to get out and buy such things without him seeing. Tonight as he left to do a food shop he asked is there anything u want?. I said u could get yourself a Christmas card from me otherwise I don t think you will get one (felt a bit bad about this) anyway he left to do the shopping. He got to the checkout and asked the lady once she put the shopping through whether she would mind going to pick a card for him as I was unable to do so myself.. She replied  of course I will  she even put it in a few bags so my partner wouldn t see it. I d just like to say thank you to her because it now means he has a card which he doesn t know about which makes me feel a lot better! Merry Christmas :-)					2016-12-19T01:09:02+0000	1482109742	2016-12-19 02:09:02	10	5	10	0	15	5	2	3	2	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have always used pampers but this particular time we are away visiting family and as the Tesco store didn t have the size pampers I require in stock i purchased your own brand.  On the Tesco brand nappies it clearly states in bold pictures on the front of the Packet  soft against baby s skin  which clearly isn t the case as the wee that has been absorbed into the nappy has hardened into hard lumpy crystals that have caused sores and blisters on both my babies bottoms. One of the twins started screaming and was restraining herself from sitting down... once we took the nappy off it was clearly apparent straight away why she was in such discomfort as her bottom was red raw with skin pealing off  my daughter was screaming in agony! Her twin brother was also red raw but not as bad as his twin sister. We have put cream on both babies and purchased a packet of pampers and hope to see some improvement by the morning. We have taken photos for evidence and kept the nappies if you need these for further investigation.					2016-12-18T21:43:37+0000	1482097417	2016-12-18 22:43:37	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only was this completely unnecessary  but it s   incredibly bad for the environment. I think Tesco needs to reassess the point of putting 1 red pepper in a plastic bag of its own (hint: there isn t one).	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15621880_10101665808573753_7662046597245704800_n.jpg?oh=741994eec8551cd5594049a639ecfda9&oe=58D87A7A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15621880_10101665808573753_7662046597245704800_n.jpg?oh=0404fd0c51217f54af76d66854daf60c&oe=58DB4B77	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101665808573753&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-18T21:39:17+0000	1482097157	2016-12-18 22:39:17	1	6	3	0	9	6	3	3	3	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0

To top it all i have a ¬£10 off a ¬£70 shop voucher which runs out today and now I can t use it! Had I have known this I would have gone to Tesco earlier today but instead if rushing around thought i would make the most of the online facility. Surely in this day and age a company like Tesco should be informing their customers that these facilities are no longer available before wasting their customers time and vouchers!!!

I bought my cards and wrapping paper with my weekly Tesco shop this year and the designs were just BEAUTIFUL. I got some very cute and rather amusing Christmas cards  with fat cats looking like baubles and Christmas puddings  with a nice glitter detailing - my 4 year old son LOVED these and gave them to his teachers  thinking they were very funny! The gift wrap I picked up was stunning and I purchased several rolls which were full of festive sparkle  covered was glittering designs of Christmas trees  snowflakes and reindeer.. I also got a card through the door from a neighbour yesterday and immediately said to my husband  Oooo  that s beautiful!  (a glittering snow scene with a snow covered Christmas tree in the forefront) - I quickly looked on the back to see which company had produced it and.. yes  you guessed it.. it was also from TESCO!! Well done  guys - excellent quality and choice (can t wait for the sales  so I can scoop some more Tesco cards and paper to put by for next year! haha..) :) :D					2016-12-18T19:01:41+0000	1482087701	2016-12-18 20:01:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My dad was the driver who had parked in a disabled bay as he can t walk too far or too fast as he has had several heart attacks and a heart bypass. I spent over ¬£100 on this shopping trip in your store as I usually do nearly every week. While I realise you don t fully own this car park I do think that you allowing this to happen to your customers is not very nice! Please find attached pictures that are online to find if the car park opening times and nowhere does it state that you can only park free for 3 hours!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15590344_10211711500842186_6188955011239869477_n.jpg?oh=9ed12eaf67217c4e522568ae87a377e7&oe=59208530	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15590344_10211711500842186_6188955011239869477_n.jpg?oh=de09b82d7de8e2bd8d60d19ece149d88&oe=591C6D3D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211711500842186&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-18T17:08:25+0000	1482080905	2016-12-18 18:08:25	3	20	6	1	27	20	5	15	8	0	3	0	1	0	0	2	0

Lucky I had my card and was able to pay ....... BUT what if I d being putting a couple of pound coins away a week to buy Christmas pressies and sweets for my family???? How s that a way to treat folk - asked at Lockerbie road branch if it was policy  they said no. Geographically Tesco Extra would be much more likely to have less well off folk surely.

We use Tesco for most things  4 x mobile phones  car insurance  credit card  general clothing and household bits and of course groceries. In fact from downloading our statements and doing a filter we have spent over ¬£50k with you in the last 5 years.  Now we were a delivery saver customer but stopped the service was poor. Examples - ordered a pregnancy test kit and got condoms  no sprouts on Christmas order but delivery driver was limping after falling over sprouts by Tesco back door - you get the idea.... Now we ve come back to delivery and so far 8 out of 8 orders have had problems. I called last week and was promised a manager from store would call me back - no call. I called again yesterday  8th order  8th problem. I was promised this manager would DEFINITELY call back between 12 and 4 today. Guess what? No call. Do you value my custom that little that you cannot even be bothered to call back a loyal  high spending customer? I am appalled at that lack of service. Please. please get someone to call me and start delivering on promises. Yours  unhappy of Stotfold.					2016-12-18T16:12:24+0000	1482077544	2016-12-18 17:12:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

(about a child receiving a dog biscuit from santa at the grotto they went to). From what this other mum describes Tesco are doing a fantastic job. I was just wondering if this was something that was available in other stores? My closest Tesco is Copdock Ipswich and would love to take my two boys to something similar. :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15589672_10211936668957955_6574328001280673558_n.jpg?oh=a1da091319fa302c4b05127ed51486ed&oe=58E72F0E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15589672_10211936668957955_6574328001280673558_n.jpg?oh=44d9f04709736a42bf17e4f82e3a6f7a&oe=59233EE8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211936668957955&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-18T15:40:07+0000	1482075607	2016-12-18 16:40:07	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Thinking that they will be a lovely treat for the time of year. Get them home and the box feels extremely light. (Not noticing this in the shop considering I was in a  hurry to get out of the overcrowded shop) Maybe the box has split? No the box is perfectly sealed. No mince pies in the box?!?!

Your website stated back in November that if we placed a Christmas week order and reserved a turkey  it was GUARANTEED.  I went in to amend my order today and get a message that the turkey crown I reserved is no longer available  NOR ARE THERE ANY OTHER TURKEYS AVAILABLE TO RESERVE.   I am completely and utterly stressed out now trying to find a turkey (crown) for Christmas dinner that can be delivered (and without spending an arm and a leg) as I do not have access to a car to drive all over the country and my husband is working right up until Christmas.  Really not happy right now.

No.  I have now returned home and about to go out to the Co-op (with my card).					2016-12-18T11:57:27+0000	1482062247	2016-12-18 12:57:27	0	13	2	0	15	13	5	8	9	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

I need to share with other customers thinking about buying this gorgeous sparkly  seasonal top  that it should come with a warning.   I wore it for the first time to my husband s Christmas work s night out. I certainly sparkled in the restaurant  as I left a trail of glitter wherever I went. There was a puddle around my chair and the other ladies knew what toilet I had sat on.   It s on the clothes  my face  the cats  my car and every corner of the house.   The Dyson has been recharged twice.   This is a warning that you will be purchasing a glitter storm.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15542140_10154211969483157_4975335044163221642_n.jpg?oh=743683be446664205db859dfa195d08c&oe=58DCD6E0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15542140_10154211969483157_4975335044163221642_n.jpg?oh=7dd1b9da9255fa9028670270a8f2744b&oe=5920A0ED	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154211969483157&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-18T11:57:04+0000	1482062224	2016-12-18 12:57:04	5	9	10	0	19	9	7	2	4	0	5	0	0	4	1	0	0

You may have read about our request for a Tunis cake  an increasingly rare alternative to Christmas cake  but very much part of my husband s  Tony Willmore traditional family Christmas.  On discovering that the Porthmadog branch couldn t even get Tunis cakes as a special customer order two of the customer service staff have been extremely generous. Dan  sorry I don t know his surname  obtained one from the Wrexham branch for us  and Wendy Johnson asked her son who works in the Milton Keynes branch to get one  and has then met him in Leicester to bring it back to Porthmadog for us.					2016-12-18T11:38:25+0000	1482061105	2016-12-18 12:38:25	13	1	15	0	16	1	1	0	1	0	13	0	2	0	0	0	0

In a panic I went back to see if I could see it. I had to catch a train and so left my details. Abby checked cctv and went looking for it for me. She phoned me to let me know I had driven away from the petrol station with it still on my roof although she couldn t find it a kind young man handed it in. I think Abby went over and above great service! X					2016-12-18T10:12:31+0000	1482055951	2016-12-18 11:12:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m sat waiting at the pick up point for a 10 -12 spot ..... and yet again the driver is late.   Is this because the drivers are arriving late for work or because they don t have enough time to pack their vans and get to the pick up points?   I could have been in the shop and out and on my way home by now.  Last time it was 10.15 before the driver arrived so wonder what time he turns up today .....					2016-12-18T10:08:47+0000	1482055727	2016-12-18 11:08:47	1	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have also responded to the customer feedback text with my issue and not had a response  I would have expected a follow up call for poor feedback. This is terrible customer service by head office  I am extremely disappointed with the level of care shown  surely you have a set length of time to respond to a customer issue? As a customer my expectation would be 48 hours at the most. A week is appalling customer service.					2016-12-18T10:00:24+0000	1482055224	2016-12-18 11:00:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yet another reason to support YOU!   Tesco logo ¬© Info Tesco has supported us for the past decade. It has donated over ¬£10 million in financial support to our emergency appeals. The partnership began in 2007  when we were Tesco‚Äôs Charity of the Year. Since then  our engagement has deepened to include an emergency agreement that supports our work both in the UK and overseas. In the UK  our emergency response teams are able to request items from Tesco stores that help us support people in crisis. This can mean supplying pallets of bottled water to a Red Cross rest centre following an incident such as an evacuation from a block of flats or providing food for residents isolated in their homes by severe weather or flooding. Ten years after Tesco made a major donation following the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004  it became a founding member of the Disaster Relief Alliance ‚Äì a British Red Cross initiative. The Disaster Relief Alliance aims to bring about closer engagement with the private sector in our humanitarian activities  providing financial support before crises occur.					2016-12-18T09:36:17+0000	1482053777	2016-12-18 10:36:17	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I booked a Christmas week delivery slot for the 19th on the day they became available just before midnight on 25th November. The first item I ordered was an extra large frozen basted turkey. Today  two days before delivery and one week before Christmas  I went to add to my order only to find next to the turkey I ordered  Tesco no longer sell this item . I can t even order a fresh one as it says it is no longer available for pre order. I rely on my Tesco delivery  being 30 minutes away from a store and because I am away for a few days before Christmas  I will be unable to get a turkey elsewhere. I thought the idea of a Christmas week delivery slot was for the necessary supplies to be delivered. Thanks Tesco  I now shall be having Christmas dinner without the turkey.					2016-12-17T20:44:29+0000	1482007469	2016-12-17 21:44:29	0	11	1	0	12	11	6	5	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Last January I purchased a Dyson from this store and today it stopped working so I took it back into store and went to customer service desk. I waited a few minutes in the queue to be pushed infront of by a member of staff on duty. I was told that I had to go up to the electrical desk and speak to them. The man on the electrical desk was only interested if I had purchased the extended warranty and gave me a leaflet  he had no idea what the process was for returning faulty goods and just told me to ring a number. I wasn t very pleased with the lack of information I had received so I went back to customer services to ask if there was anything that could be done in store. The lady working on the desk was apologetic and said that it was up to the people on the electrical desk and that there was nothing she could do. As far as I am aware electrical items have a 1 year warranty as standard and according to the consumer rights act 2015 the responsibility to repair or exchange faulty items is the stores not the manufacturer. It also states in your returns policy that if an item if found to be faulty within 12 months you guarantee a repair  exchange or full refund.  I love tesco usually but feel very let down today üò¢					2016-12-17T19:18:51+0000	1482002331	2016-12-17 20:18:51	4	10	6	0	16	10	7	3	5	0	4	0	0	0	0	2	0

On friday i went onto my account to check i had ordered a ironing board ( we have just moved into a new house). There was no recorded of order on my account. I called your help line  a form was filled in and a promise of a call today was promised. I am still waiting for call and would very much like to know if i am going to recieve order as the products ordered are in much need. Thanks  Juls					2016-12-17T18:56:49+0000	1482001009	2016-12-17 19:56:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When we got home and opened the packet we were gobsmacked to find the contents sporting a little more flavouring than expected.   As you can see from the picture below  not only do we have some lovely spice mix for tomato and pepper fajitas  but we also have a salsa packet that s sprouted it s own special mould that looks less than appetising.   Ordinarily I would just return the kit to the store but I live 35 miles from the store and it s a fair trek to swap a ¬£2 fajita kit  that if I m honest I don t really fancy having anymore.

Your ready to roll puff pastry is poor.  It retracts  doesn t cook nicely and does not have the expected texture.  Disappointingly I have wasted a jar of M&S luxury mincemeat on discovering this.  I fear that Christmas  could be ruined with this pastry and thus was compelled to let you know. I shall not be purchasing that again.					2016-12-17T18:32:48+0000	1481999568	2016-12-17 19:32:48	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A big thanks to Sonya at your Metro store on Dean Street in London. Went in to purchase a higher than usual quantity of items. She went out of her way to provide products in original outer packaging to help with carrying on my repeated trips  opened an extra checkout to speed up service for me to prevent holding up other customers. Service levels are generally slipping across all companies. Was great to see she  along with her colleagues smiling  being extra helpful and engaging with customers during this busy and stressful time for retail workers. Please pass on to the appropriate. A big Happy Christmas to you and you colleagues üéÑ üéÅ üîî üéÖ üè™ ‚ùÑ üçó					2016-12-17T18:26:16+0000	1481999176	2016-12-17 19:26:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As you can see on the clearly labeled mince it s original price of ¬£3 as seen on the reduced label an employee incorrectly labeled it as original price ¬£3.50 and reduced price as ¬£3.12.. Now may I suggest that maybe in the employee bonuses you consider to include optician bills. I know how much glasses can cost when you work and I suggest whichever employee may want to get themselves down to specsavers.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15578838_840687436071249_2002376838087131166_n.jpg?oh=a376ced1a2f12c015511e7d6769fdc55&oe=591CBDC4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15578838_840687436071249_2002376838087131166_n.jpg?oh=c132bf9b64ef916731bbe0d587a35a9d&oe=58E4D03B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=840687436071249&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-17T18:23:40+0000	1481999020	2016-12-17 19:23:40	0	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	5	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

I used the small photo machine i payed and when it started printing in got jammed! I had 3 young kids with me board I went to try and find someone they said I had to queue at customer services which i did for 5mins then he said here s the manager I got out of the queue to go to machine where she was for her to say the machine has nothing to do with us you have to call the number I can t help you I phoned them for them to say that I have to go to customer services tell them take my receipt and they refund me and that they have told Tescos this before and they should all know so how did the MANAGER not know!! So I queue again to then be told by the lady at the counter she doesn t know she then had to phone the place and it turns out there is a selection on there tills that do refunds for the photo machines!!! So in total the whole thing took me bout 30 mins with 3 grumpy board children!!!! I saw the manager I told her so she knew so no one else had to have the same problem for her just to say ok ok and look at me in disgust!!! I take my son to Surrey sports centre every Monday and Friday and go into that store at least once a week!! I will never ever go into that store again!!!!!!					2016-12-17T17:47:26+0000	1481996846	2016-12-17 18:47:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have never made a complaint before as have been a loyal customer for many many years despite previously working as a grocery supervisor at another supermarket for a long time.  So imagine my disappointment when I received my home delivery shop the other day and a special Christmas present that I had bought for my father a bottle of Jura has still got the security tag on it!!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15442367_10157973973205512_2109806673582003868_n.jpg?oh=bc08936e00d7ebe9ce7efeb2981fce5d&oe=58DF3685	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15442367_10157973973205512_2109806673582003868_n.jpg?oh=f5055bb5e9a64951f76cf489b1314df9&oe=59204288	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157973973205512&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-17T16:53:53+0000	1481993633	2016-12-17 17:53:53	0	13	4	0	17	12	3	9	10	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0

Last week you broke my heart  and my tannin consumption by discontinuing my favorite wine. Although I can t forgive you  I can applaud you for employing at the Finchley Ballards Lane store the human gem that is Mario. I think he is only with us for Christmas  because he s wearing a Santa hat.  The most positive  friendly  and helpful person I ve met in ages.  Give him a permanent job/more money before he goes off to become a motivational speaker  or an actor.					2016-12-17T16:40:16+0000	1481992816	2016-12-17 17:40:16	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There were no changing facilities that we could see  so we asked the lady at customer service who replied  there s plenty of space in the disabled toilet  you can use that .  This meant changing my little boy on a wet  dirty toilet floor  I find this completely unacceptable and feel something should be done to resolve this asap.					2016-12-17T16:20:20+0000	1481991620	2016-12-17 17:20:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We don t have the recipt but he did use my clubcard so it should be logged. I m not impressed to say the least.   Also can you tell me why the processes in that store are different than any other? Staff members are not allowed to pay out any sort of lottery win. They have to call for a manager to pay out. Even if it s a ¬£1 win on a scratch card. When I asked why  a staff member  who will remain nameless  told me it s because management say they don t trust the staff. It has a massive impact on cueing times  makes the management seem unreasonable and undermines the staff  who do work hard in there.

So  I see your most excellent Mr Happy teapot online reduced to ¬£8 which is great as I ve just broken my teapot and really love it. As I m going to Tesco I thought I d pick one up  but in-store they re ¬£11 and they won t match the online price as it s Tesco policy. So I m going to order it online meaning that I save ¬£3 but it costs you more as you re paying someone to pick  pack and deliver it to store. It just seems illogical!					2016-12-17T13:43:18+0000	1481982198	2016-12-17 14:43:18	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We couldn t find any cooked chestnuts and first of all she happily took us to the aisle that they should be in and was genuinely apologetic when they were out of stock. 10 minutes later we were at the checkout when Karima reappeared with two packets of chestnuts that she d managed to find. It was so lovely that she d been so thoughtful and come looking for us - above and beyond! I hope this can be passed on to her :) Merry Christmas!					2016-12-17T10:56:21+0000	1481972181	2016-12-17 11:56:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Delivery booked for 9 to 10am  with the whole household awake in various locations of the house we found a  Sorry we missed you  note at the door timed 09.08  husband calls tesco customer services at 09.14 (6 mins after) to inform them we never heard anyone knocking  our delivery note even stipulates that we may be a couple minutes getting to the door due to having a small baby to put in a chair.  Told we would have to wait till the end of delivery round (we called 6 minutes after the note was left!!!). After explaining on 3 different calls that we are spreading my late father-in-law ashes this afternoon and cannot wait  there was still no movement to facilitate getting our shopping to us. Customer services suggested getting it delivered later in the day... why would I want to leave my grieving family to pop home to get the shopping??   I now have to wait until 11am for a manager to call me from the store because they are out delivering...! What major store has no one available to talk to a customer? TESCO that s who.  I am appalled and disheartened as a long standing customer to Tesco  who pays in advance for delivery as a regular  that a delivery van cannot make its way back to quickly drop off the shopping we had requested between the hours of 9 to 10am  when we called almost immediately to inform them we were in the house!!					2016-12-17T10:28:51+0000	1481970531	2016-12-17 11:28:51	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was delighted to discover that I had the option to pick a date for delivey and that today s date was available. I was happy to pay the ¬£5.95 for delivery.  I was advised my order had been received and would be delivered between 7am and 7pm today.  I was ready and waiting for delivery by 7am today.  No boots.  I checked my email and discovered an email from DPD advising they had not received the order from Tesco but would update me as soon as possible.  I waited.  No boots.  I checked on the DPD website via an emailed link which now tells me that my parcel was in Birmingham at 9.35pm and would be on its way to the Uddingston depot shortly. It also said at the bottom that my boots will not be delivered until Monday the 19th December.  I have paid ¬£5.95 to pick a date for delivery for Tesco to pick their own date.  I have hospital appointments on Monday and have no intention of missing my appointments in order to allow Tesco to deliver my item on a date I didn t pick.  I am extremely unhappy.  If you can t deliver until Monday you should state that at the time and allow me to make the informed decision t take my custom to someone who can.					2016-12-17T01:14:25+0000	1481937265	2016-12-17 02:14:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Next they ask the children if any of them can name 3 reindeer to win a prize. The kids start shouting out names eagerly and each won an early xmas present! A wrapped chocolate reindeer! 8 very happy kiddies and 3 very happy mummies who will be recommending Tesco and their approach to children to anyone who will listen. It s so difficult taking children in to super markets and you forever feel judged and like you are not doing a good enough job! The two men really made us feel welcome and encouraged the children to play and laugh whilst other staff assisted us in locating the items we needed. Big thanks  on what was a really horrible day you restored my faith in humanity and don t understand how big of an impact your small gesture made! Well done Tesco! You have employed two men who are incredibly good at their job and their customer service was outstanding.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15439764_1831819073699995_5983690087463641944_n.jpg?oh=0f850b70d7db5181397d68b97c11575c&oe=59215A48	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15439764_1831819073699995_5983690087463641944_n.jpg?oh=c55977c3f1efdce2dc88332aa18efb01&oe=58EA6234	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1831819073699995&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-17T00:16:05+0000	1481933765	2016-12-17 01:16:05	48	8	53	2	63	8	3	5	2	0	48	4	1	0	0	0	0

Just wanted to let all my friends know about the Christmas tree in the door way of Tesco with all the children s names and ages on. These are all the children in the area who do not receive a present on Christmas morning. You take a tag from the tree and buy them a gift to open at Christmas. I don t have much money but Olivia Yates Harrison Yates and I have each bought a few gifts for 3 children to open on Christmas morning. I m not posting this for a  well done   I am making people aware. (I only found out about this last week!!!) imagine if every shopper took a tag from the tree and there were none remaining?!!! How fabulous to think every child in the area was able to open a present??? Please share and make everyone aware. What s a couple of extra pounds on top of your Christmas shopping bill??? It s the difference that will bring happiness and smiles to the child you bought for. Do these children think they don t get a present because they have been naughty all year?? Please take a tag next time you shop and please share this post. xxxxx üéÅ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüéÑüéÖ					2016-12-16T23:56:44+0000	1481932604	2016-12-17 00:56:44	4	10	4	0	14	10	1	9	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

All the aisles were packed with cages from one end to the other. Some aisles I couldn t even manoeuvre down or reach to the shelves due to the volume of cages. I accept that during the quiet evening period this is a good time to replenish shelves but please remember your store is still open and there are customers still shopping. Anyway  one particular aisle I went down a female member of staff started to pull a cage backwards so I move back and stand and wait for her to pass by us  but instead of moving the cage that was in her way she bashed the cage into my trolley! I shout out  woah   yet she continues pushing it after looking at me  and pushes the trolley handle into my 6 year old daughters neck and chest crushing her between the end of the aisle and my trolley. I had to ram the trolley forward to move the cage away and when I complain to this member of staff she just walks off! üò° After turning down into another aisle I could hear her telling another member of staff that I  was complaining?! I have every reason to complain about her behaviour as she had just injured my daughter and proceeded to be rude about it. I found her behaviour completely unacceptable and I expect better from staff especially while the store is still open to customers like myself.					2016-12-16T23:34:27+0000	1481931267	2016-12-17 00:34:27	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tonight I opened a bag of spinach to find cabbage also in there. I used it anyway as I was not driving to the shop to buy more when I was cooking dinner. And the bags spinach goes off faster than Asda s once the bag is opened. The other week I found multiple packs of bacon going brown in the fridge despite weeks left on the use before date. I reported it to a staff member who had to remove almost all the packets from the shelf. Its ruined my confidence in the tesco brand as it s not the first time.					2016-12-16T22:16:43+0000	1481926603	2016-12-16 23:16:43	1	4	1	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Merry Christmas to all at tesco.					2016-12-16T20:03:56+0000	1481918636	2016-12-16 21:03:56	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Luckily I checked my email before heading out as the item has been returned today  even though I was informed that the item would be held until the 18th Dec.  I rang their Customer Service team only to be told that I would have to re-order  but could not use my vouchers as the offer was no longer valid.  Not happy at all.  Asked to speak to someone who could help but was told that who ever I spoke to would tell me the same thing.  They then asked for the me to send over the email that states that the parcel would be held until the 18th  but again confirmed that there was nothing they could do.  Great customer service - NOT.					2016-12-16T18:37:06+0000	1481913426	2016-12-16 19:37:06	0	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

This isn t something I m normally driven to do but quite frankly I m miffed and hungry! Bought this yesterday with a view to having a pre-drinks party feed (tonight) with some saut√©ed mushrooms and new potatoes.  Yum. The star of the show - the Tesco Finest Vintage Cheddar and Caramelised Red Onion Quiche was a real let down. You would at least expect a HINT of cheese with the adjective Vintage involved. Nope. None. Cheese free.......and Caramelised Red Onion? It LOOKED  like Caramelised Red Onion.  It tasted nothing like Caramelised Red Onion....and to top it off  a soggy bottom. VERY disappointed Tesco peeps  very disappointed.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15542187_10154242878196819_6612243099591404310_n.jpg?oh=d815ec74b2646ec48ada7225b868ff4b&oe=58E31C46	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15542187_10154242878196819_6612243099591404310_n.jpg?oh=2e2ec1ef22eb8303a9522fa7cf64c001&oe=59247C4B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154242878196819&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-16T17:44:35+0000	1481910275	2016-12-16 18:44:35	2	8	3	0	11	7	7	0	13	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

As coeliacs we do not choose to eat gluten free as a  life style choice  as a member of staff referred to the reason it was moved. It shows a lack of common knowledge and insight by the manager to allow this change to happen. As a coeliac  I do not care if you need gondola space for the Christmas tat and promotions. I do not wish myself or other coeliacs be made feel marginalised and segregated further. I made a verbal complaint to two lads picking in the same isle and the said they were surprised themselves. The customer service desk lady also said I wasn t the first to complain and that she found it shocking and embarrassing that we would have to find our food in the pharmacy and toiletries section. I ve informed Coeliac UK both local branch and national HQ.					2016-12-16T17:35:29+0000	1481909729	2016-12-16 18:35:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son fell over and hurt his lip in your store. As soon as he saw the blood he was hysterical. A member of staff was with me in seconds to ask what she could do to help  (sorry didn t get her name) while the promtional Lindor lady was already off getting me tissue.  When I asked for a cold compress  a first aider was called and I didn t get one  I got 5 within 10 seconds. One was getting ice for my son  while one was stopping the bleeding  one went off to get his favourite sweets and the other two asked if there was anything they could do to help. Tonita (who was awesome) stayed with us the whole time and the Lindor lady entertained my other two whilst I was consoling my little boy. A manager was also there and asked if she could do anything.  I honestly and still am shocked at how caring they all were. My other two boys ended up walking away with a Lindor bunny rabbit and the injured party got not one pack of sweets but 11. I was so emotional holding back the tears and then got told how much of an amazing person I was and to keep up the good work.   I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart  you were all so professional  calm and simply amazing.					2016-12-16T16:39:43+0000	1481906383	2016-12-16 17:39:43	19	5	23	0	28	5	3	2	7	0	19	4	0	0	0	0	0

We regular visit Tesco to do our shopping and since having my 9month with me the parent bays are very handy  that s if you can get one.   You have regular signs about people parking there hat don t have kids. This really gets me as I go shopping by myself with my little boy  it s hard enough getting the shopping on the car with a baby but then having to struggle getting your child back in the car seats.  I have reported this numerous times to the different Tescos I ve visited in particular Alfreton to no prevail. It s like no ones interested!!!   You provide these for a reason! You should stick to the fines and do something about it!!					2016-12-16T13:58:57+0000	1481896737	2016-12-16 14:58:57	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now I completely understand the stress of working retail  especially during the holiday season - I worked last year during the Christmas season on checkouts so I understand how busy and stressful it gets.   When I had gotten to the checkout with a few items  one of which had a security tag  so I thought it would be quicker to go to a person rather than self scan! The checkout operator I had was elderly  not sure her name. She was absolutely awful with customer s items  throwing it down the belt and not even waiting for them to pay and move before throwing the next customers items down the belt! She d thrown the lady s items so hard in front of me her box of doughnuts  burst open onto the floor. Ignoring my items for a bit I bent down to help her  noticing my own items was still being thrown down the belt with force. The operator then eventually stopped and stood up to scoop up the doughnuts and then started shouting at the lady to get another box herself while demanding me for my Tesco s card! The poor lady in front of me had to abandon her shopping and go and get another box of doughnuts at this point. I paid for my own shopping and turned to tell this operator to have a nice Christmas - and she started complaining to a customer behind me about myself and the lady in front of me! Something about  we don t need slow people at this time of year; people like that slow the whole checkout down!   This is absolutely unacceptable having being in customer service myself! I also suffer with multiple anxiety disorders so shopping in general  especially at this time of year  and going to an operator is a big deal for me  it s not right for your operators to be throwing items down and complaining to people about other customers! This resulted in myself having an anxiety attack. I know it s busy and stressful at this time of year but it s no excuse to treating customers in this manner.					2016-12-16T13:13:31+0000	1481894011	2016-12-16 14:13:31	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s 12:34 and your Alfreton branch have no gluten free cobs and no sandwich thins of any variety to buy! This is a weekly lottery on whether they are going to have any of the sandwich thins or cobs I need for work. They don t last any longer than a few days so bulk buy is not an option! Specially at Chrismas it is a joke!! The Christmas range doesn t leave much to the imagination either other than sold out stickers or empty shelves.

They always shop with you and spend thousands in a year.  They are in the middle of selling their house and did not expect to move out before xmas so they ordered their xmas food with you to be delivered. However they have exchanged and contracts have been signed to move on 21st December.  Stressful enough moving let alone on top of xmas and now YOU have made it even worse.  My daughter rang to say could we please have it delivered to our new address and was told no they could not change it!!!!! How difficult is it to change an address? She has given plenty of notice and it s not rocket science is it?? Go on the system and change the address or give the different address to the delivery driver.  So much for you being the top retailer.  You re at the bottom of the pile and customer service you obviously don t know the meaning of.  This is disgusting and diabolical service. I do not see how difficult this is  it s not like she s given you no notice and moving to the other end of the country!! Tesco   every little helps  hahahahahahaha tesco   Dont ask for help you won t get any  DISGUSTING  DISGRUNTLED  ANGRY.  You re the bottom of the pile on retailers customer service.  This isn t the first time I ve had bad service from Tesco but this is the icing on the cake!!!!!!!					2016-12-16T12:22:28+0000	1481890948	2016-12-16 13:22:28	8	30	8	1	39	30	10	20	16	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m not not a happy Shopper Tescos . Either your buyer hasn t got it right or it s a big fat con !   What am I talking about you might ask ?   FRESH COUNTER WHOLE SALMON ¬£4.50 kg ..... that s if you can find it   you ll be lucky.  You released the offer on Wednesday  I called the Marks Farm Tescos and response was   sorry 0 stock. I travelled to witham Tescos to be told had only 1 crate delivered on Wednesday ( 6 fish ) all gone in minutes.  I travelled to Marks Farm Tescos this morning to be told   had 6 fish delivered yesterday   all gone in minutes. None delivered today.    However we have had a big delivery of filleted side of salmon at ¬£10.50 delivered this morning   . no thank you.  The fish monger couldn t tell me when the next delivery would  be   why not ?!  Tescos you show this offer online   and on posters in your stores  shop windows etc   yet it s not readily available in store. isn t this against trade description act ? Shouldn t they be removed ? I do not want to order on line as I like to see what I m buying.  Please sort this out   I m sure I m not the only shopper complaining.  DEAR FELLOW SHOPPERS!

Specifically asked for express delivery because it s a Christmas present for my 5 year old nephew who we re going to visit today in Scotland. How do I now tell him he doesn t have a present??

There must be an issue with the packing / distribution process to allow this to happen - I now find myself checking each biscuit for cracks before dunking this adding on valuable time to my morning routine  I can t shave any more time off my morning number 2 to accommodate this. I never experienced this with Sainsbury s own brand Malted Milk and am very disappointed.					2016-12-16T09:50:41+0000	1481881841	2016-12-16 10:50:41	9	1	13	2	16	1	1	0	0	0	9	0	0	4	0	0	0

She had been on the phone to your customer services for 4 hours apparently then evening before without resolving the issue so I took up the reins.  After 3rd call without resolving issue (not really anyone s fault) we were out through to a guy called Ben in the technical department. Well..after about hour and half between us Ben and I resolved the problem which was unbelievably the Turkey crown in the shopping basket was not allowing us to put through order!! The only thing my poor Auntie wanted desperately.  So very long story short we had to give up on the Turkey and order the rest of food and try and get her a turkey elsewhere but....last night she received a call of apology and was told a turkey crown would be included in her order free of charge.  So thank you so much firstly to Ben who had extreme patience And then to tesco for making my aunties Christmas she was do very upset and frustrated but now happy.. Please pass to Ben if you can and to his bosses - this guy is a keeper. Merry Christmas and New Year..					2016-12-16T09:00:04+0000	1481878804	2016-12-16 10:00:04	5	3	5	0	8	3	1	2	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last Thursday I ordered a next day delivery for a friend who lives 4 hours away as a birthday gift (I know it sounds lame but we are both students and the best gift we can get is food sometimes!). I paid ¬£3 for a delivery slot as well as ¬£4 basket charge on top of the actual shopping so that s ¬£7 just for delivery!  My friend stayed in for the allocated couple of hours on her birthday and waited but nobody came. I had a missed call from an unknown number who I called and text and received a message back saying it was the driver and he had knocked on the door but there had been no answer.  Now  my friend lives in a block of flats so you have to go through a door (which is always unlocked) to knock on her door and knowing she was in waiting felt maybe this was the problem. Rang customer services who contacted him and gave him her mobile number then rang me back to say he was still doing deliveries so would try again on his way back. My friend then had a call to say sorry  but he had  cocked the order up  (very professional) and would have to be tomorrow.  My friend had waited in for 4 hours on her birthday at this point. She then called three times over the course of the next two days  each time being told they would call her back and never did. Due to being a nursing student on placement I only managed to get hold of her this Tuesday - 3 days later! - for her to tell me that it had never come and nobody would return her calls. Just before 9pm Tuesday night I rang customer services again very upset that this had still not been delivered and neither of us knew what was happening.. the guy was very nice and understood my frustration and said he would call me back. Which he did.. to tell me that unfortunately  because it was coming to the end of the night  they had already closed down all the tracking systems- 2 hours before customer services close! So could I please call back tomorrow. I couldn t call back tomorrow as I was at the hospital all day and today have discovered that I received an email saying Tesco are  pleased to confirm my refund  days ago!  So in short : my delivery was not delivered on the day it should have been. No effort was made to try and redeliver and in fact efforts made by the customer were ignored  customer service apparently shut down their systems two hours before the end of their shift  and not only does my friend not have her birthday present even a week after(!!) But my order has been cancelled and refunded without me even being consulted!  I m not sure if there is any other way your customer service could have failed in this situation and I am thoroughly appalled and frankly  quite upset! I now have to order her something else for her birthday and a little something extra to make up for missing it!					2016-12-15T23:17:25+0000	1481843845	2016-12-16 00:17:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m 45 miles from the nearest large Tesco (15 from a small one) - I m disabled  live on my own (but look after my mum who lives near me and is blind) and currently having chemo so can t get to either store. I ordered the Xmas stuffed turkey crown (easy to cook when I m feeling so poorly) from online and checked it was in stock the night b4 my planned Xmas freezer food delivery but it never came :( I told the driver my predicament - he rang the manager who promised to get one to me before Christmas. A day later there was a ring at the door and there was my turkey - compliments of the manager. So thanks him for making my Christmas Day complete and his amazing kindness to me at a time when life has given me a downer (I ve lost my job while off work ill as well). Three cheers for my Christmas hero ... Alison					2016-12-15T23:16:48+0000	1481843808	2016-12-16 00:16:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a 3 year old it can be tough having to go shopping with your Mummy after a long day at nursery but my son was trying his best to be well behaved and find everything we needed  he even helped carry the basket and gave the broccoli a stroke. We were helped by a lovely lady (I m sorry  I didn t find out her name but she had a lovely smile  went out of her way to be helpful and had a few piercings if that helps identify her).  She helped us find everything we needed  even though Mummy was a bit frantic by the amount of times we d discussed which cakes Nannar had bought him last time she visited and helped him decide which magazine was required (it can be difficult to choose a favourite reading between Peppa Pig and Go Jetters  Mummy frankly thinks you offer too many choices!)  The very kind lady told my son where she d hidden the squash and special offers on pizza before she waved us both goodbye and wished George (my son) a Merry Christmas on the way out. As I mentioned before Mummy was having a hectic moment when we visited your store  it had been a busy day at work  a long journey back to nursery to pick her little man and lots of idiot drivers on the way there which she had been unable to express her utter contempt for as she had her lovely son in her car and her feelings towards said drivers were not appropriate to be shared with a 3 year old. As a result we didn t manage to express to the kind lady just how much easier and enjoyable she d made our visit Tesco so I m hoping that you would be able to do that and pass our thanks and best wishes for the Christmas season to her. We both hope she has a lovely Christmas and New Year and thank you for being so lovely when we visited today.					2016-12-15T21:14:22+0000	1481836462	2016-12-15 22:14:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

How about you require your suppliers to just put  suitable for vegans  on products that are? That would save a lot of time and the result would be much happier customers. That is assuming happy customers are one of your goals!					2016-12-15T21:08:54+0000	1481836134	2016-12-15 22:08:54	3	4	3	0	7	4	2	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Both items said they were in stock and still do but I have just received an email to say sorry but Tesco are unable to fulfil the order and have had to cancel. And more annoyingly  I will be refunded in 3-5 working days. So you can take my payment instantly but can t refund me for days. This might be all the money someone has to spend on presents and in 3-5 days it will be too late to order elsewhere. Fortunately I can buy them now somewhere else but that s not the point. Tesco states the items are in stock and I trusted that this was true. I just think people should be aware otherwise they could end up without gifts for their kids.					2016-12-15T21:03:18+0000	1481835798	2016-12-15 22:03:18	0	5	0	1	6	5	2	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon completion of the order I realised there was a few items that wouldn t reach me before Christmas or that I didn t want on there. I phoned your customer service line in order to cancel these selected items and the gentleman took a note of them and informed me that his system was down and that he d rectify it ASAP and inform me when he had done so. This order was ¬£137. I later visited your tesco extra store in Newmarket. Me and my partner were very hungry and thought we d have a meal in the restaurant there. We ordered lasagnes to be told there was none left. I chose a jacket potato with beans and cheese and my partner ordered a burger meal. When my jacket potato arrived it looked like it had been sat around all day (this was 3pm roughly). Even the lady who served it said she wouldn t eat it. I asked to replace it with a burger instead. When my partners burger meal arrived the burger was so cold the cheese couldn t melt  the chips were like warm and the bun had a black charcoal like crust around the outside. We asked for a refund and went to do some shopping instead. We then spent around ¬£115. When I got home I checked my emails as I hadn t heard about the cancelled items  I phoned your customer service line again to discover the gentleman hadn t cancelled them at all and now it s too late to cancel at least 1 item. I have spent over ¬£200 with you today even with the 3 cancelled items just to receive awful customer service. Attached to this post is a picture of the burger you deemed acceptable to be served to a paying customer. Disgusted with the whole company today.					2016-12-15T19:50:49+0000	1481831449	2016-12-15 20:50:49	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Reading the back of the voucher and the paper pouch with it  it says it is valid for use at Tesco.com. So I make an order  go to checkout and can find nowhere to put in the voucher number. I try putting it into the voucher codes box. It doesn t work. I scrape off the scratch off area and put that in too. Still doesn t work. So I consult your   help  on the website. Gift vouchers are not accepted at Tesco.com apparently! I do hope this gift voucher will now be honoured in store now I have removed the scratch off area  due to misinformation?	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQC20rhBeMhVZZcz&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmetrics.tesco.com%2Fb%2Fss%2Ftescodchpwwwebbrowserallprod%2F1%2FH.23.6--NS%2F0%3FpageName%3Dhome%26pageType%3Dhome%26q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww%252Etesco%252Ecom%252FDefault%252Easp%26r%3D%26server%3Dwww%252Etesco%252Ecom&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQDkwpJ7Zg0viIdI	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBgyvYbxl6E_1bd&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmetrics.tesco.com%2Fb%2Fss%2Ftescodchpwwwebbrowserallprod%2F1%2FH.23.6--NS%2F0%3FpageName%3Dhome%26pageType%3Dhome%26q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww%252Etesco%252Ecom%252FDefault%252Easp%26r%3D%26server%3Dwww%252Etesco%252Ecom&_nc_hash=AQDZWr0OEmylKH-b	http://tesco.com/	tesco.com	2016-12-15T19:00:03+0000	1481828403	2016-12-15 20:00:03	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was going to the toilet and was about to go into the disabled toilets when a member of staff said in a sarky tone that s the disabled toilets!! It actually upset me as I have an ileostomy and am entitled to use the disabled loos!!! It says on the door of the disabled toilet that not all disabilitys are visible!! I complained about the lady in Question to her supervisor who took her off the till to have a word with her and assured me other members of staff would be told too!! I actually lifted up my top and showed the supervisor lady my ileostomy bag and explained it s hard to go out some days and when I get a sarky comment like that for using a toilet I m actually entitled to use it makes me want to stay home!!!  It upset me and I think more people should be aware of this and don t judge before you know! The supervisor could not apologise enough to me so credit to her!					2016-12-15T18:55:49+0000	1481828149	2016-12-15 19:55:49	2	30	3	0	33	30	8	22	17	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

This toy collection for the Evelina children s unit at St Thomas s London is made in the name of a dear friends Angel Baby  Isaac. I think it would be nice if someone could care enough to donate some toys to sick children who will have to be in hospital over Xmas.

A ¬£7 item online and showing in store is actually  ¬£10 in store.  However  you won t sell at the online price but I can have it delivered to your store for the ¬£7!!! even though you have copies on the shelf.  Where is the logic in this?  It ll now cost you a picker  packer and petrol to deliver my book. ¬£3 may not be a lot to you but it is to my daughter looking to buy her nanny a present!!!  PS.  I didn t buy your book.					2016-12-15T18:13:06+0000	1481825586	2016-12-15 19:13:06	2	5	2	1	8	5	1	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Luckily I had some Albert Bartlett potatoes left that I had to use for dinner tonight as these ones that we purchased in your Burgess Hill store are all rotten inside. The bag is still full as three of the potatoes were the same. And they are still in date.  To say I m disappointed would be an understatement. I will continue to buy my veg from Lidl and my local greengrocer from now on.  Jeff Poortvilet is not doing a good job of potato farming I d say...

On Tuesday at Wolverton  Milton Keynes  we bought a week s supplies.  This included two new to us products - Chinese Meal for Two and Beef Casserole.  The Chinese comprised prawn crackers  spring rolls  egg fried rice  sweet and sour chicken and chicken with cashew nuts.  The spring rolls were almost entirely pastry with minimal filling.  The sweet and sour chicken was too sweet  even for sweet and sour  with too little fruit or veg and too much sauce   The chicken with cashews was nearly as sweet as the sweet and sour  which it should never be  mostly sauce and the cashew nuts were very scarce.  The chicken  which the label admitted was from Thailand  lacked texture and flavour and could easily have been mistaken for tofu!  The beef casserole was worse.  The gravy was unpleasantly glutinous and was by far the main ingredient.  The vegetables were lacking in quantity.  But worst of all  half of the beef was inedible due to gristle and sinew.  Much of it went in the food waste bin!					2016-12-15T16:01:50+0000	1481817710	2016-12-15 17:01:50	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve never received such appalling service as I did in Tesco  Oldfield Road  Sutton yesterday!!    Firstly  I tried to purchase a pack of car air fresheners but was told by the checkout lady and Customer Services  that I couldn t purchase them because they weren t catalogued/listed so they couldn t be swiped through!!!!  Therefore  the perfect little stocking filler I wanted for my son  was snatched away from me!!  What kind of sales technique/customer service is that?!!!!!   Secondly  having used the large Christmas gift bag I purchased to carry some gifts home in  I was very disappointed that the handles broke before I even made it to the bus stop!  Having traipsed all the way back to the store  struggling to carry the handle-less bag  I went to the  customer service desk AGAIN and the lady I approached showed her colleague the condition of the bag  her colleague grunted at her  which  as she proceeded to process a refund  meant that she granted the refund.  The lady serving me watched me unpack all my shopping from the offending gift bag and put it into another bag  threw the receipt on top of my pile of shopping and thrust the refund at me.  During this time  not a single word was uttered from this lady s mouth  no apology  no offer of assistance and no thank you!!!!  I even tried to make eye contact with the staff member to smile at her but she was completely unresponsive to me!!!!  I m appalled #tescosutton!!!  How can a company who s staff don t have a clue about even the basics in customer service  be making so much profit?!!!!!					2016-12-15T14:57:39+0000	1481813859	2016-12-15 15:57:39	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Since Tesco is is my main shop I thought about purchasing this as it s a great idea  however I ve been told that Tesco don t have this?  Have you any idea if this will ever come into effect?  I think it s a fantastic concept and would love to avail of it.  üòÉüòÉ					2016-12-15T14:28:31+0000	1481812111	2016-12-15 15:28:31	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately my main branch is at Berwick on Tweed. Most of the year this is a peaceful and unstressful place but it has now descended into the madness of last year - but worse. Not only is the bakery section unapproachable because of raucous music but there are tinny yet loud CD players at other points in the shop. ( A mole tells me there are 4 of them) Many people are unable to use the basket till by the entrance because of the raucous noise.It is unwelcoming to be greeted at the door by a barrage of sound. One lady was so distressed the other day that she strode over and turned the wretched thing off. Within a few yards of this  at the Christmas card section  there is another CD player blaring out stressful inanity. Remember the cacophony of separate devices all playing different things. This is the 21st century - isn t it about time Tesco had a comprehensive disability policy and also trained its staff in disability awareness? Some of the new staff seem to have few interpersonal skills. Christmas is unpleasant and stressful for many people. There is no need to add to it inthe hope that you will shore up your falling profits by bludgeoning people into buying by numbing their brains with excess noise. Please send this to the appropriate management section at head office.					2016-12-15T13:57:50+0000	1481810270	2016-12-15 14:57:50	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been trying to get hold of a paw patrol large play set for my son for Christmas. I couldn t find any in store  but online it stated the store had some in. I asked a tesco employee Richard  who helped search on his phone and was going to take me to the direct desk when he managed to locate one in store. I then panicked thinking how I was secretly going to pay for the toy with my son with me  so Richard offered to take my son round the corner to look at the toys  whilst I paid and got the paw patrol toy wrapped up. He was so kind and absolutely brilliant with my son. I then was told by another employee he doesn t even work in toys he s from the food section! Thank you so much Richard and to tesco for making my trip today that bit easier. You where so lovely with my son  I really appreciate you going beyond what s expected just to help a customer out! A brilliant employee and such an asset to tesco. Well done! üòÅ					2016-12-15T12:31:23+0000	1481805083	2016-12-15 13:31:23	550	32	576	9	617	31	23	8	78	0	548	23	3	0	0	0	0

A member of your staff (can only identify him as male  45/50ish with cool festive trousers on) could see my predicament and went to the bakery to find him something to cheer him up. That saved my shopping trip and although a small gesture really meant a lot to me.

I ve had to use it this morning as I m too ill to get out. I booked my slot for today and picked my food  I did it in the allotted time and when is finished my slot was taken and can get it till tomorrow night and it was more expensive delivery cost.  I have no bread in  no milk  cat food etc. This will be the first and last time I use this service.					2016-12-15T11:57:26+0000	1481803046	2016-12-15 12:57:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But with so long to wait  her thoughts fill with hate.... Ripping the wrapping and stripping the string  she s hoping what s inside will just make her sing. What does she see when she throws away the card but a half melted butter and pure beef dripping lard.

It was a little present box with a Christmas card and some lovely treats inside! I am so chuffed to receive these goodies and wanted to say how lovely it was to receive. It is particularly lovely for my family as my youngest son has recently become disabled and little things (like the magic reindeer food in the box) are going to make Christmas that much more special for him when he s had a really hard year. Many  many thanks to you and to Coral and James (who the card is signed from) for our gift  and merry christmas!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15542109_10157984748070038_5696165666966500127_n.jpg?oh=82fde46f610b1e62825284708caed32d&oe=58E62AF8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15542109_10157984748070038_5696165666966500127_n.jpg?oh=0ebbc4bfd53a11fe8c842f1f896544ea&oe=592153F5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157984748070038&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-15T11:23:56+0000	1481801036	2016-12-15 12:23:56	9	3	9	0	12	3	2	1	2	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday evening I visited one of your stores with my one year old son. I work full time and therefore have to shop during peak hours (weekends and evenings). I often shop with him by myself which makes it a bit tricky if spaces near the trolley bays are full.  I would never complain about a lack of parent and child spaces as  when used correctly  there are more than enough. However  last night  I watched a man cut in front of me and take the last remaining parent and child space. I also watched as his (roughly) NINE year old son got out the vehicle and the two of them walked into the store. The rest of the car park was full so I parked at the back  no where near trolleys or the store. I carried my son to the store to put him in a trolley  and when we were done  had to carry him and the bags back to my car. I then had the issue of squeezing him in as someone was parked next to me by this point.  I was exhausted last night and I had just had enough of this. I wrote to your customer services team  however  they called this an  unavoidable problem . I see this so much with parents who park here and one will go in whilst the other stays in the car with the infants (why?!) and parents of much older children who can walk themselves into the store. To me  having these spaces here and not putting a penalty for misuse is just insulting. This issue is not unavoidable and will be affecting thousands of busy and exhausted infant parents every day.  There are penalties for parking in other allocated spaces. Your sign clearly states that the spaces are for use of parents with children under three. Include on that sign that there will be a penalty for misuse. The threat alone would stop so much of this from happening and your parent and child spaces would make shopping that little bit less stressful (which I imagine is the point?). As I said  this is a suggestion as I am not buying your excuse that this problem is  unavoidable .					2016-12-15T10:34:44+0000	1481798084	2016-12-15 11:34:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

An employer has the right  whether or not it is explicitly reflected in the employment contract  to require a worker to work on a public holiday. It is common in industries such as retail or emergency services. We have also heard from hon. Members about other sectors such as hospitality  sport and leisure. Employers can determine when workers take their leave‚Äîfor example  to cover an annual shutdown at work‚Äîand can refuse to give leave at a certain time  but they must give workers the opportunity to take their leave at some point during the leave year. The entitlement should give all workers sufficient time to see their families over the year  although I accept that Christmas and various other times of the year are absolutely associated with spending time with family.  In addition  there are special provisions for shop workers who do not wish to work on Sundays  at least. All shop and betting shop workers can opt out of Sunday working  unless Sunday is the only day they have been employed to work. A shop worker can opt out of Sunday working  even if they agreed in their contract to work on Sundays  by giving three months‚Äô notice.					2016-12-15T10:25:18+0000	1481797518	2016-12-15 11:25:18	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just want to say how fantastic she was in responding quickly  efficiently but most of all personally. After being initially disappointed and was expecting a standard email response I was pleasantly surprised.

One eventually arrived - now find they can t supply the second one. I also found  after placing the order  that the sets are supplied by a third party who IN TURN contract a fourth party to deliver them. So the probability of a failure somewhere in this complicated and poorly-managed supply chain is huge. Be aware of this  folks. You may be paying Tesco - but that s not where your goods are coming from. I have cancelled the whole order in frustration. You d think over ¬£700 worth of business would be more important to a company who are languishing in the retail sector....					2016-12-15T08:19:29+0000	1481789969	2016-12-15 09:19:29	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every time lately I ve bought them from you they have tasted absolutely horrible. Yet if I ve bought them from the A supermarket 2 miles down the road from you they are fine.  This has happened on more than one occasion now. Different batch numbers too so perhaps it s down to how you are storing them. At ¬£2.39 it s not ideal when I have to chuck the box away.					2016-12-14T23:30:53+0000	1481758253	2016-12-15 00:30:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ate my Chinese takeaway really fast so that I would be ready to unpack my shopping when it arrived.

If i hadn t drove on to the verge your van would had gone straight into the side of my car at at least 40mph. The side my toddler sits. I had 3 very scared children after what happened. I rang customer serves  who told me they would look into what happened and get back to me. That night i had a phone call from a manager at one of your Coventry stores who was shocked at what happened and promised to call me back....... Well 3 weeks on and I ve still not heard a thing... The night it happened i could hardly drive the rest of the way to get my husband i was so scared and shocked that your van could do that and then beep at me like it was my fault... I had no idea they were changing lanes we had just drove a corner and they didn t indicate to show they were changing lanes.. I really don t get why no one has got back to me about this. Dose your company not care about the way your drivers drive?? or the fact they took me off the road and if i didn t drive on to the verge you could of done so much damaged to my car and my 3 children that were in there.  Please will someone finally get back to me to let me know what has happened about this!!!!					2016-12-14T22:21:19+0000	1481754079	2016-12-14 23:21:19	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco please grow up and stop with the propaganda.   Today s order (the first and last) came with broken items. The driver says  well the problem is our scanners don t work so if you want a refund for the broken items (do you think i am a charity?) you will have to call customer services .   As you are early  cant you go back to the store and get the replacement items .  He turned around on his heals and took everything away.  That i assume is a no?  Called your helpline to be told by Brandon  well he shouldn t have done that    I think the delivery driver told you the wrong thing    I will call the driver to find out    the driver isn t answering  and  I will need to call the store to see what is happening .   They wont resend your order .  After 1 hour on the phone to manager Gary Rankin  you are nowpaying for my total shopping bill and redelivering tomorrow.

Unfortunately he couldn t finish them well wait for it ..... out of the pack of 20 cards he only had 15 envelopes  16 cards and of those only 13 were usable the other were already written on..... no idea but Simon and Stephanie whoever they are had made a start lol !  Who returns Christmas cards for a refund when they have started to write them ?  Was a 3 for 2 pack deal but still very surprised and my son found it a little strange ! Thought I would share ........					2016-12-14T21:16:39+0000	1481750199	2016-12-14 22:16:39	0	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

With your busy lifestyle I m sure you ll appreciate the little bits of luxury that you get to treat yourself to every now and then. You work hard  your run a family and a home whilst holding down a job (and travelling between Barry Island and Honiton) and sometimes it s nice to give yourself a little something extra.   As you re no doubt aware it s coming up to Christmas time and that means present buying and with that comes present wrapping. Some people love it. They absolutely love it. They ve got the protractors out measuring right angles  scalpels at the ready and could take on the world. Now  I have  a friend  who recently popped in to your local Honiton Tesco store in Devon to purchase the necessary tools including the wrapping paper. We all know that this fancy outer layer to your present can really set the tone. It s like getting a Kinder Egg  you just know it s going to be good. My  friend  decided that day would be treat day. Caution was thrown to the wind. That day luxury wrapping paper was purchased. I ll wait whilst you take a second to get your breath back. Better? Good.   A roll of your 3M Luxury Wrapping Paper was taken home. My god and Sweet baby Jesus those presents were going to look good! As you know   Every little help makes a big difference . This luxury paper was going to seal the deal. Move over Pamela these presents are going to be hot. My  friend  was armed and ready  equipment laid out ready to do this. This is where this real life true story hits a snag. Paper was cut   present sat happily in the middle  tape at the ready. And then. Mr Tape was applied to said Luxury Wrapping Paper. Did it stick? No. Ok  well we all know that some tapes are not as good as others  but it s ok. There was a leading brand in the drawer  unopened all innocent in its packet like our sweet baby Jesus on his birthday. Take two. Paper was cut   present sat happily in the middle  tape at the ready. And then  Mr Tape was applied to said Luxury Wrapping Paper. Did it stick? No. My  friend  kept trying. Time and time again Mr Luxury Wrapping Paper would not accept this sacred bond. At this point there s glitter all over the place like a fairy has ate too many sprouts and has glitter farted spraying it everywhere! Over the floor  over my  friend   glitter in their hair looking like they re off on a night on the town. A Christmas sparkly town.  You can imagine the distress  that one treat  that every little that could help those presents just set the tone. To say dreams were shattered is an understatement. Now my friend has naked presents  and worse  naked Luxury Wrapping Paper that looks like a man on his stag do who fell asleep and the lads shaved his glittery hair off  bald as the sweet baby Jesus on the day he was born.  Please tell me you can help my  friend  and restore their faith in the joy of Christmas  the joy of wrapping presents and the joy of Luxury Wrapping Paper.   We eagerly await your response to our Christmas nightmare.  Many thanks Pete and my  friend  who really is real Lisa Gummer.					2016-12-14T21:13:39+0000	1481750019	2016-12-14 22:13:39	15	18	23	3	44	18	8	10	14	0	15	2	0	6	0	0	0

Was really disappointed to be unable to find the pants OR a space on the shelf from which they were missing. Have Tesco stopped selling them? They had bigger sizes but hopefully my youngest grandson  who s two next week  will be fully potty trained before he s big enough for those?					2016-12-14T21:13:30+0000	1481750010	2016-12-14 22:13:30	0	8	0	0	8	8	1	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Couldn t go anywhere as didn t want to miss the collection. Could have seen my godson in his nativity. Or taken the dog for a walk if I d known. Even called up late afternoon to check the collection was still set. I get that the only time scale you can give is between 7am and 7pm. But when you give such a broad time scale and nothing happens  it adds to the devastation. I didn t even have chocolate in the house!!!!!!					2016-12-14T20:43:59+0000	1481748239	2016-12-14 21:43:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The other two (from Tesco) were delivered a few days later but the remaining item (from The Entertainer) is at the Tesco supplier warehouse and has been for almost two weeks. Now my money went out on the 28th November. I called today to enquire about it and spoke to someone who could not care less about my missing item and told me I would have to contact The Entertainer myself to find out. I said I was not going to do this as I ordered from Tesco and not The Entertainer. He said he would find out for me and ring back. I haven t heard anything. I m appalled at the customer service here and it s putting me off ordering again from you. I ve always been happy with the service but nothing has gone wrong before.					2016-12-14T18:47:53+0000	1481741273	2016-12-14 19:47:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I usually use the Whitfield store which has been declining in recent months. Today the store was very busy ( approx 5pm) yet only two cashiers were open. The store was strewn with rubbish and the floors were absolutely filthy. I only wanted some milk and a pack of six sausage rolls. The milk I got but only one pack of two sausage rolls were on the shelves that were otherwise completely empty. At 5pm on a Wednesday! I also bought my daughter a Christmas jumper for children in need day on Friday. There was very limited choice and the conveyors belt was so ingrained with dirt I was reluctant to put it on! On leaving the store it was difficult to negotiate my way out through the multiple members  of staff having a chat! Once I got in my car and tried to drive past the petrol station  this was severely hampered by a line of traffic trying to get into the petrol station. This was due to the fact that yet again most of the petrol pumps were closed. Absolutely appalling!					2016-12-14T18:41:24+0000	1481740884	2016-12-14 19:41:24	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had purchased a 43 inch Smart TV in the Black Friday deals in November  and since it had been turning itself off and on. I had called up the Tesco electronics helpline where I was told to take the TV back in store where it could be either exchanged or be collected for repair (even though I told said person on the phone I had no transport). I decided to take my 43 inch television on the bus with me  even though it was bulky and weighed a little.  When I made it to the service desk  they had no clue what to do. They had never heard of bringing it back into store and the courier collecting it from there. I told them I had no transport so getting it home was a task. So Mary  one of the ladies behind the desk  rang the electronics help line again where they explained my situation. Then Will  a manager had taken over the phone call and had explained they had no same TV in store and no way of getting it repaired. Will then came off the phone and offered me a refund. I explained I liked the TV and would much rather a repair. He understood.  Then Charlotte  another colleague  decided to call the manufacturer. Within a few minutes she was arranging my TV to be collected for repair just needing me to give my details over. Needing the serial number off the back of the TV she took a photo on her phone for me to read to the person still on the phone. Then everything was done. My TV was going to be repaired.  I thanked them all and was going to be on my way when Racheal  another lady behind the counter offered me a lift home with my TV and to my surprise Charlotte and Sam handed me over a ¬£10 good will gift voucher.  But if anyone was doing the good will it was them.  What a good team of staff you have. Each and every one I met  went above and beyond for me. And I appreciate every bit of it.   Thank you Tescos  Every little did help.					2016-12-14T17:55:36+0000	1481738136	2016-12-14 18:55:36	3	6	3	0	9	6	1	5	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Nowhere in the description for these dog food  products does it say  pate  or should it and as I am not an animal owner I am even less understanding as to why your search results should throw in pet products into my online order. I think your team need to rectify this asap before putting any other loyal and long standing customers off their food and should this happen with other search items too. I hope this is just an oversight on your behalf.					2016-12-14T17:08:02+0000	1481735282	2016-12-14 18:08:02	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I made an order online for Christmas gifts on the 30th November  I received the dispatched email on the 2nd dec but never got an email to say delivered to my local Tesco but I thought I would pop in to ask why it still hadn t been delivered 5 days later. My local Tesco told me it hadn t been received there. I called your  helpline  on Monday and spoke to Jonathan  he advised me he could not trace the parcel and he would call my local store to check there and call me back. Jonathan called me back he left a voicemail advising me the parcel was lost and he would resend this. Today I have called your  helpline to progress chase as I hadn t received any email updates. The advisor I spoke to today went through all the say information as I had to go through Monday and I explained I had already gone over this and the parcel should have been resent Monday. I was then told that in fact my parcel was never resent on Monday  my original parcel is lost and both items I ordered are now out of stock and I can have a refund? Errrr what!!! I don t want a refund I want the playmobil I ordered that got lost through no fault of my own! I was then told he would put me on a register for stock alert as it may be back in stock Friday. He then went on to tell me I can call back when I get a stock alert and request it be resent?! What! Really?! So through no fault of my own I call you back again and I m not guaranteed to get the item I have ordered and paid for? Really! Is this acceptable customer service? I don t feel it is  I asked to speak to a manager and his replied he is a manager  I asked the complaints process and I was told to email. I am disgusted in the service I have received on both calls  I even explained to him I can t call Friday and keep checking my emails as my son is in hospital Sunday. I am very disappointed and I m now left with no playmobil ! Thanks Tesco.					2016-12-14T16:31:47+0000	1481733107	2016-12-14 17:31:47	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only brought it this lunchtime and told a colleague about it  who then went to buy some for her granddaughters  except she was refused purchase as the store member said they were being recalled but didn t explain why. Both incidents happened at the same store within about an hour an a half..this will be a christmas present for a 4 year old  but i m now concerned I shouldn t be giving it to her for some reason? Could you provide more details of this product recall please?

I ve just had one of your pots of melon  strawberry & kiwi. Delicious  great for lunches  and come with a handy spork. However  the chunks of melon are so big  the spork snapped when the melon was lodged halfway in my mouth. I now can t get it out  and I m having to wait until it dissolves naturally ... in about 15 years.					2016-12-14T14:09:43+0000	1481724583	2016-12-14 15:09:43	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today s useful subs:  I ordered three products from your Finest (I.e. more expensive) party foods range on 3 for 2. Two items arrive (both vegetarian). The third option was not available (season and shake waffle fries - also vegetarian) and gets substituted with cheap (not finest) chicken goujons (clearly not vegetarian  not even decent quality free range meat). I confused the driver trying to work out how this affected the 3 for 2 and just accepted them figuring they were free and I could find someone who might appreciate them. Looking at my receipt more carefully now  I didn t get the the bloody 3 for 2 anyway and have ended up paying for an item I don t want and can t eat. Why would someone substitute chips for chicken?   Then we get the GF cheese and onion crisp bakes substituted with cheese and ham hock ones.  Surely it would be common sense for packers not to substitute meat free products with meat?!   Not particularly happy with Tesco right now especially after someone from Tesco rang a few weeks back doing a survey asking how happy I was with my deliveries  the drivers  substitutions etc and I mentioned then that the thing that irritated me the most was meat free products being substituted with meat products. I know us vegetarians are frowned upon and get very few decent veggie options but you sending me meat products isn t going to sway me back to eating meat!					2016-12-14T12:36:50+0000	1481719010	2016-12-14 13:36:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can your IT boffins work out how to add a  Would you like to choose an item for your local food bank?  message at the ONLINE checkout? Similar to the messages reminding us about what we usually order. I know this won t be particularly simple to sort out  but maybe you could liaise with the foodbank people and choose the top ten required items and give us the choice of adding those to our basket.  I m sure the benefit to those in need in our communities would far outweigh the effort required.					2016-12-14T12:27:56+0000	1481718476	2016-12-14 13:27:56	21	10	22	0	32	10	8	2	12	0	21	1	0	0	0	0	0

When the paper is wrapped in cellophane it is not clear that it is actually loose glitter all over the paper. Whoever designed your xmas wrapping obviously didn t consider that cellotape does not actually stick to loose glitter!!! Hence your delightful pretty paper is actually useless!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15420830_1363291557014802_6844932444563685826_n.jpg?oh=7b3d031be6448f7a2fc86831766052a4&oe=58D9BD97	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15420830_1363291557014802_6844932444563685826_n.jpg?oh=482517fe9e4139878d3394ef8cdb5660&oe=58E7FDEB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1363291557014802&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-14T12:05:22+0000	1481717122	2016-12-14 13:05:22	3	10	3	0	13	10	4	6	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Call Customer Services to confirm cancellation to be told that they have cancelled the order and I will receive a refund. Clarified with the social media team that the order has been cancelled.... receive a phone call this morning from the store reminding me that my order is there waiting for me and were unaware I had cancelled!! Contact the social media team  instead of answering my question regarding why the order hasn t been cancelled and where my refund is? I am advised what steps have been taken to address the cancellation process internally? WHEN AM I GETTING MY REFUND??? Looks like my ¬£88 is sitting in Tescos bank account for Christmas!!!!!!

I booked a home delivery for a one hour time slot as like most working mums I have a busy schedule. My shopping was over 45 mins late with no phonecall/email/text to tell me why. On delivery the driver was very rude and snappy and my frozen items were soaking wet. If the money hadn t already come out of my account I would have told him to take it all back. Not one apology.

He didn t feel like a normal delivery man  it was almost like friend delivering? If that makes sense?

Was asked to write a review for my click and collect order for next day delivery to my local Tesco store. So I did. Tesco did not like my feedback and so sent me an email telling me they were not going to publish it !! Can you believe that ?? I gave an honest review of the service and stated that they should not use plastic bags to ship boxes because the boxes get damaged and then they decide that is not want customers need to know and block the review.  Tesco  you should be ashamed. If you ask Customers for reviews  you should publish them all  good and bad  although my review was not all bad  just a comment about your shipping methods.

I run a community charitable organisation(not a charity) feeding the homeless and needy from the local church we are just 5 minutes away from your Accrington branch but every time i go in to ask if they can help us i get fobbed off with a different story..the last lady was rather rude saying if we wanted money we need a headed letter(i told her it was tinned and dried food we were hoping to get not money) we are not a charity we don t have a letterhead.I took our bank details which shows we have a community account and our trust deeds to which she wasn t interested in even looking at is there a number i can call that can give me the correct information i need as other large companies in the area have been ever so helpful and donate to use twice weekly.I just can t understand the behaviour and unwillingness to help a local community charitable organisation that feed the homeless and give out food parcels to the needy.					2016-12-14T02:19:01+0000	1481681941	2016-12-14 03:19:01	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why did I pay ¬£5.95 for a specified delivery date if I then wait in all day for the order not to be delivered? No tracking available for the order and it s only when I phone customer services I find out there s a delay with the courier. So I have to take another day off in case it gets delivered tomorrow. Refunding me my delivery charges does not make up for needing to be home for two days. And still I don t know if my delivery will arrive tomorrow as the tracking still doesn t give me any information. Time to shop elsewhere.					2016-12-13T23:03:19+0000	1481670199	2016-12-14 00:03:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We decided to do our Christmas food shopping in your store  at approximately 4:30 my poor wife slipped on banana of all things which was on the floor in the wine aisle  she fell with such a horrible thud causing staff and customers to react.  Mr Adam Monday  member of staff calling for the first aider and showing great concern so hats off to this young man. My wife was helped to her feet by myself then felt sick and dizzy with pain to her right arm and shoulder and to leave the premises immediately for fresh air leaving me to pay for the unfinished shopping  hence no formal report was filed in writing which I might add will be rectified this week.  As a result we both had very little sleep that night and spent most of Sunday in Carlisle A&E. Thankfully there are no broken bones but apparently ruptured ligaments can take longer to heal oh happy days NOT.  With the run up to Christmas and loads to do looking likely I m going to have to leave work a week earlier now to help at home as she can only use her left hand properly.  The reason I m letting you know about this episode is as follows  my wife doesn t like any fuss nor does she like the idea of anyone getting into trouble and above all puts a brave face on  she is sitting here in tears because of the pain and stressing about sorting things out for the family for Christmas.  I m not like my wife  I m absolutely furious. John Morrison.					2016-12-13T22:08:55+0000	1481666935	2016-12-13 23:08:55	0	9	0	0	9	9	4	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I find these cookies particularly morish and thought I d indulge tonight and buy myself and co workers some. However upon pulling them out of the pack I find 3 with parts missing!!! What happened? Was there a faulty machine in the factory or is a member of staff secretly stealing edges cause of their irresistible yummyness??

For a couple of days everything was fine... Until we lit the candle and within minutes a REALLY weird smell started. Turned out the glue that holds the wood together has melted and let off this noxious gas. My family had to leave the front room and we had to put fans on to get the smell to go away. Not only is that REALLY not safe  it s probably toxic. I can see from others that you don t answer posts on Facebook but I d love a response to this please.

Being told to stand in one place before today and then stand there today to have 2 customers get served before me! Then when I do finally get to the till the server is so rude to me saying who had told me to stand there and that it s always been the other end by the self serve to be able to get to the normal tills! No one I know ever stands by the self serve unless they want to use the self serve  I wanted the normal tills to get cigerettes and I m fed up of it not being clearly labelled on where to stand as no matter where I do stand someone always ends up being served before me. Really annoyed at the way I was spoken to today!					2016-12-13T18:13:15+0000	1481652795	2016-12-13 19:13:15	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our slot was to be delivered between 4 and 5pm  5:00 came and still no sign of our driver  5:02 and it arrived. I said to the man that it was our order and he was instantly jolly and very happy. He got out the van and was cracking jokes and making me and my family laugh the whole time he was here  he apologised more than a few times for being a couple of minutes late and was brilliant unloading our shopping  he went through how the list worked and explained about a short dated item and said in the jolliest way imaginable that he would take the item back if we didn t think it was 100% perfect. He was absolutely brilliant and brightened my day completely! Over the 10 minutes that he was here  he was easily one of the loveliest people I have met. A real gem to your staff team Tesco! I didn t catch his name but the way i can describe him; he looked like santa haha  glasses  big white beard  thank you for brightening our day and merry christmas!!					2016-12-13T17:41:37+0000	1481650897	2016-12-13 18:41:37	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Purchased today  2 *fresh* marinated lamb steaks - get home and unpack  one of them is 5 days past the used by date. Thankfully noticed before someone received food poisoning. Phoned the store to let them know and was put through to THE rudest member of staff who answered the phone sounding utterly p****ed off with  hello . No introduction  no can I help you  just hello. Her name  on asking was Hannah. I pointed out how rudely she had answered the phone and she didn t even reply. I was told I can take the steak back for a refund. No apology  no we will look in to this.   Meat on the shelf 5 days past its sell by date and seemingly your staff are not bothered at all. Is this Tesco policy???					2016-12-13T16:25:22+0000	1481646322	2016-12-13 17:25:22	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After completing the sale  no receipt stating my order was printed  still no staff member at the Direct desk so went to the customer service desk who were more than helpful and telephoned a manager for advice...after all this time I was getting closer and closer to having to pick up my daughter so when I was told by the manager Brad Simpkin that I had to just go back to the direct desk and wait ( he was on his break and couldn t be bothered to take 5 minutes to deal with the problem  I had made him aware that I had to leave ) I went back again for a third time to still no staff at the direct desk!! The dismissive way in which my problem was dealt with was just rude and disrespectful and as a manager myself was incredibly angry at the way in which I was treated. My suggestion at this particularly busy time of year would be to take a minute and retrain your managers in how to effectively deal with customers in a polite and concise manner. As this is my local store I will now be shopping elsewhere in the hopes I get a decent level of service.					2016-12-13T15:43:07+0000	1481643787	2016-12-13 16:43:07	6	9	6	0	15	9	6	3	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

After our broken bicycle that couldn t be exchanged we agreed to buy a new bicycle and wait for a refund on the old bike. We did that  spent money on a present we had already bought  and waited for a refund. It s day 7 since the broken bike was picked up  working day 5  and we ve just been told the refund will take another 3- 5 working days. That s almost 2 weeks  so as it stands we have done everything you asked and all that s happened is that we have bought two bikes from you. We were promised the refund would be back yesterday or today  that the bike was received last week- today we re told that isn t going to happen. I m now ¬£40 short on my weekly food budget on a present I ve bought twice  this is exactly what we feared would happen. Can you please help?					2016-12-13T15:39:12+0000	1481643552	2016-12-13 16:39:12	2	34	9	5	48	34	20	14	41	0	2	0	1	0	0	6	0

I would just like to thank Marc as he was probably unaware we had just left the hospital for yet another appointment as Arlo is getting tested for Aspergers  ADHD and Autism  he absolutely made his day! Also as we were leaving Arlo didn t stop staring at another one of your colleagues who had long white hair and a long white beard and the very convincing (slim) Santa look a like gave him a big wink! I didn t catch his name but Arlo was gob smacked!! Now he says he has a new friend with his favorite colored hair (red) - Marc and that Santa works in Tesco also!

When ordered it was listed as in stock and would be delivered before Christmas if ordered before 15th December 2016.  The delivery date was given as 12 December 2016.  On phoning the customer services dept the representative made up a lie that it would be delivered on the due date and I should just continue waiting in for it  after questioning him further as to why it had not been dispatched yet I was eventually put through to the manufacture of the oven who stated that the earliest delivery date was 28th December 2016.  In most people s calendar this is AFTER Christmas not before.  Phoned back the customer services to be told by another Tesco customer services person that Tesco are not responsible for info on their website and that I had bought the item directly off the manufacturer.  This is completely untrue it was purchased off your website and the company who took my money was called www.tesco.com and not the manufacture as describe in a lie made up by your customer services representative.  Is this really legal to charge peoples credit cards for items that you do not have in stock and have no clue when they will be available?  If Tesco is not responsible for the information on its own website who is?  Shouldn t there be a warning that the information may be untrue before you take the money?	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQC20rhBeMhVZZcz&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmetrics.tesco.com%2Fb%2Fss%2Ftescodchpwwwebbrowserallprod%2F1%2FH.23.6--NS%2F0%3FpageName%3Dhome%26pageType%3Dhome%26q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww%252Etesco%252Ecom%252FDefault%252Easp%26r%3D%26server%3Dwww%252Etesco%252Ecom&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQDkwpJ7Zg0viIdI	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBgyvYbxl6E_1bd&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmetrics.tesco.com%2Fb%2Fss%2Ftescodchpwwwebbrowserallprod%2F1%2FH.23.6--NS%2F0%3FpageName%3Dhome%26pageType%3Dhome%26q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww%252Etesco%252Ecom%252FDefault%252Easp%26r%3D%26server%3Dwww%252Etesco%252Ecom&_nc_hash=AQDZWr0OEmylKH-b	http://www.tesco.com/	tesco.com	2016-12-13T15:08:22+0000	1481641702	2016-12-13 16:08:22	1	10	1	0	11	10	3	7	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called security over who told me they can t enforce the men move  this is rediculous. If that little girl had been hit by a car those men would be none the wiser  please please please enforce that only cars with children in can park in those spaces.

I bought this  luxury  wrapping paper yesterday and imagine my disappointment after wrapping say 6 or 7 presents  I turn around to the pile and see that all the sticky tape has sprung open due to the ridiculous amount of glitter on the paper. No amount of tape is going to hold this down without the parcel looking like it s been laminated.  I take two rolls back and 3 packets of labels to exchange to something a bit more suitable and ask nicely if they could replace the one roll that was half used and will now need to be re-done. I was then told without the paperwork from the roll of paper she couldn t possibly replace it. So am I expected to go home and fish this out the bin  even though she has two rolls with the same paperwork on them and my receipt?  I was then told that keeping the stock levels accurate was very important and they could not hand out free rolls of paper (even though its 2 for 3 on rolls of paper).  So what I gather from this is that the stock take is more important than customer service and Tesco can t afford one roll of paper (unless you buy two first). They expect customers to go home and rake through bins and they expect customers to waste time and money to go buy new paper and re-wrap all the presents that need to be re-done.  Not cool Tesco!!!  p.s. My living room now looks like an elf has spewed gold glitter everywhere!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15541686_10211815856454816_6905084488726920397_n.jpg?oh=527eafd6bb15aa21322895e3a806cb5b&oe=58DDD82E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15541686_10211815856454816_6905084488726920397_n.jpg?oh=2cb1394d17ecfcabd3d58303f422deaf&oe=5919AE23	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211815856454816&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-13T13:53:40+0000	1481637220	2016-12-13 14:53:40	5	23	10	0	33	23	7	16	18	0	5	0	0	4	1	0	0

So I was having a pretty rubbish morning  both me and 6weeks old son are full of the cold  so needless to say there has been a lack of sleep in my house!  The man who delivered my shopping (I didn t catch his name) just cheered my morning right up! I answered the door with a screaming baby in my arms- the man was so kind (I think he could see the steam coming from my ears at this pointüòÇ) and made a point of talking to Angus as he came in with my bags. He then proceeded to carry my shopping into my kitchen for me without even asking. As I was grabbing some bags  he even stopped to chat and laugh with Angus and calm him down!!  Maybe doesn t seem a lot to anyone else but he really made a difference to me this morning so I just wanted him to get an acknowledgement that it was certainly appreciated. Thankyou very much.					2016-12-13T12:56:26+0000	1481633786	2016-12-13 13:56:26	35	2	35	0	37	2	2	0	1	0	35	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just had my grocerys delivered and wanted to say thank you. I had a lovely card with some club card vouchers for my 150 delivery. Also I had a lovely little box of goodies as a little Christmas gift. I have already rung the store to thank them personally but wanted to say thanks.

What are my rights regarding the reduced price etc?

Have loyally shopped with Tesco 52 weeks of the year for 15 years and I have now had my Christmas delivery conveniently cancelled yesterday. This has also happened to me once before 3 years ago. No explanation  no compensation offered until I mentioned it and compensation not sufficient. Was told this will be looked into but I would not receive an explanation as to how my slot was cancelled. Tesco do not care about my custom. The cancelled slot is no longer available. Customer Service Manager informed me that I was one of four customers who had called with the same problem!!  I feel this is a case of my slot has been cancelled because Tesco have overbooked each Christmas slot and are not able to meet the demand.  I booked my Christmas slot at 12.23am on Saturday 3rd December to ensure I got the slot I wanted and now I have nothing ! I was not even offered a click and collect slot as a sorry for the mess up !!!  Very disappointed !!!!!! Hoping in vain that someone actually cares enough to help.					2016-12-13T11:09:36+0000	1481627376	2016-12-13 12:09:36	0	29	1	7	37	29	9	20	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I visited your Great Horton store today and was told this has always been a rule. I have never had a problem paying with card before. Surely this should be across the board and maybe a sign would be useful where the gift cards are so customers aren t made to feel like idiots when they get to the checkout!

Was told by the customer service desk just after 10pm that they were closed and to return to the checkout. The assistant at the checkout was very apologetic  but stated after asking the assistant on the next till  that there was no one she could call to deal with a mispriced item or to refund it  and i would have to return tomorrow. No duty manager  no supervisor or anyone to support your staff or help your customers who shop later in the evening  or lack of training of customer facing staff in the out of hours procedures?? Whichever it is  It s not the level of service you expect in such a large store.					2016-12-12T23:25:21+0000	1481585121	2016-12-13 00:25:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This driver has completely blocked the footpath on a narrow road  opposite double yellow lines and within feet of two side roads. It was completely impossible for the elderly gentleman to get past with the wheelchair. I suggest that you take this matter up with the responsible driver.

I have started a little local drive on my page and in my area asking people to donate ¬£3.30 each ... hoping to make enough money to buy a few of these camping mats with the intention of handing them out to the homeless ladies and gents of Manchester before the weather takes a serious turn ... I don t know if you re aware but one poor soul was recently found frozen (to deathüò™) in Manchester and this small insulated barrier between the floor and their bodies can make all the difference ....  I was hoping that (cheeky but festive eh?) maybe for every five people I manage to get to donate maybe tesco could donate one too?  After all....

Santa asked me to help in providing a hamper for each of the 24 members of staff in our employ.  I decided to choose you in assisting me in this task.  I   had selected 24 of your Panettone and 24 of the mixed. Nuts in shells  an order of approximately ¬£260.00.  As you do not deliver to my place of work I had the order placed to my home address.  I waited in patiently...  Even though it I a very busy time of year...  Your driver arrived within the given time slot.. With one pallette containing   6 mixed nuts and 2 panettone üòµüò®üòµ    I had no choice but to reject the order as it was a total mockery...   Let s face facts here you were 40  items short totally shambolic.  Tesco you should be ashamed of your service.  I will not give up on Santas wish but I will be asking Sainsbury  Morrisons or maybe even Marks and Spencers to assist as it would appear that this task is to much for you.					2016-12-12T20:35:32+0000	1481574932	2016-12-12 21:35:32	1	9	1	0	10	9	3	6	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was pretty stressful as 2 week old decided as soon as we walked into the shop that he was hungry & 2 year old was being just that - a 2 year old!  The option for him to have a free apple to eat helped enormously as we started our shop. However as he finished his apple he began to get upset again (not wanting to be sat in the trolley!) we continued until we got to the checkout at which point both 2 week old & 2 year old were pretty hysterical & people were staring! Part of me just wanted to leave my trolley full of shopping & walk out but my stubborn side made me continue! Whilst unpacking the shopping  2 members of staff (management I believe) came over & started to talk to my 2 year old. They asked him what was wrong & he pointed to the  Bob the builder  toy at the end of the isle that he had seen & really wanted. Without a second thought  the staff took this out of its box & handed it to him. My initial thought was of dread - that I now needed to pay for this üò¨ however they would not let me pay for it & continued to talk to my little boy & to play with him whilst I packed up my shopping (jiggling & shhhhhhing the 2 week old in his sling) - they did offer to help with the packing too!  These 2 members of staff turned a very stressful shopping trip into a successful one & I have been wanting to public thank them for their thoughtfulness since the event  but have been a little busy!  I hope that this message gets back to them  it was a man & a woman  I m sure they would remember us  my 2 year old was pretty loud üò¨ Your generosity meant that once back in the car  my 2 year old happily played with his toy whilst I was able to feed my 2 week old. Thank you  I am so very grateful!  Have a fabulous Christmas üòò					2016-12-12T20:09:09+0000	1481573349	2016-12-12 21:09:09	115	24	124	10	158	24	13	11	49	0	115	7	2	0	0	0	0

I went to purchase nine boxes of Lindor chocolates among other things for my elderly mother as small Christmas gifts. They were on offer (3 for 2)  but when I got there the offer was off. I enquired at customer services if the brand guarantee still applied and was assured that it did (¬£4.89 at Tescos  ¬£3.50 at Sainsbury‚Äôs). I self-scanned and was told that the price would adjust when playing. Oops... NO! I was told that it would cost me more to travel to my nearest Sainsbury (approximately 40 miles) than I would save! I was then told that the brand guarantee for multiple purchases only applies to the item first purchased.

I just want to say what an amazing ambassador Sadie Haynes is for your company. Sadie and I have known each other since school  and although we didn t get to see each other much growing up  she now works at my local Tesco Extra store in Hanley and I see her on many a visit. Sadie s efforts towards local fundraising have seen her participate in some amazing events for charity in store and she is always prepared to do what it takes to get the message across to your shoppers. She is always smiling  even when she is dressed in the most outrageous of costumes and you can see how dedicated she is to helping make an impact on the lives of those less fortunate. I just wanted to give her a mention as this time of year is about giving  so Sadie  I see all that you re doing out there and I hope your company does too. Have a merry Christmas and may that festive magic bring you as much happiness as you re bringing to others. #everylittlehelps					2016-12-12T19:41:34+0000	1481571694	2016-12-12 20:41:34	26	15	40	5	60	15	9	6	32	0	26	14	0	0	0	0	0

I took my children to the store today to choose food to donate to the local food bank where Tesco has a drop point.  My Daughter stared chatting to Jim as he was stocking up the cereals we were selecting  she told him why we were there & showed him her list. He then gave her this box of biscuits to add to their donation.  My children were thrilled & I was very touched by this gesture.  I always tell my children that kindness breeds kindness & today he showed them this.  The lady that served us at the checkout was also really lovely  I didn t catch her name sadly  she was really engaging & patient with both my children.  Today this store showed my children true Christmas spirit  thank you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15391184_10154844460753453_6941861137661054624_n.jpg?oh=429a81a77382fa5d295d3acc70b1e6f2&oe=58E30044	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15391184_10154844460753453_6941861137661054624_n.jpg?oh=72400d08c477a3a58b85f918f0700bc2&oe=59191C49	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154844460753453&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-12T19:37:07+0000	1481571427	2016-12-12 20:37:07	73	6	78	2	86	6	1	5	2	0	73	5	0	0	0	0	0

I was at your store in Gaywood  Kings Lynn  clothe shopping with my 12 year old daughter. As she is short for her age I needed her to try on her clothes. The changing room was locked. There was a button which said to press for assistance. I did so. Waited five minutes and pressed again. Still nothing. I walked to a lady standing in front of the till (she had a telephone headset on)  assuming she could help. I told her I d pressed the button twice and still nothing. She then told me the button didn t work. Why no signs? Anyway  she said she d get someone for me. I heard the loud speaker asking for someone to attend the changing room. I waited another ten minutes  still nothing. I asked her again  she put out another call. Waited another ten minutes. Still nothing. Decided to give up. As I walked past her  I told her to forget the call  as I had had enough waiting. Her response of  sorry lovey . Sorry lovey???? No further attempt to help or resolve the problem. I ended up driving to Asda where the staff were more than happy to assist! Very poor show!					2016-12-12T19:11:22+0000	1481569882	2016-12-12 20:11:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Anyway  The staff who dealt with us were amazing. The female duty manager who took our accident report was lovely  she could see Oscar was getting distressed  along with my 2 year old at having to wait around  so she let them both pick a wee sweetie & then got us some wipes to clean up afterwards  whilst paying lots of attention to both boys. My eldest has taken a shine to a mini trolley that holds wee customer satisfaction cards. She could see this  and she s let him keep it. He s over the moon at this. Also special thanks to the security guard on duty. He was extremely helpful  attempting to find a first aid kit for me  and also gave Oscar lots of attention to try and calm him down.

While it is great that you do this  it does kind of bother me that you sell these items at full price - including your profit margin.  Would it be possible for customers to identify items that they have bought for the food bank collection box  and for tesco to sell these at cost?  By all means cover your overheads/staff etc  but if you sell them for cost  maybe people would be more likely to put some items in for those that need help.  Just a thought - would welcome your feedback #trusselltrust					2016-12-12T17:29:57+0000	1481563797	2016-12-12 18:29:57	1	7	1	1	9	7	2	5	21	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s disgusting that they failed to help an elderly gentleman (81 years old) who was assaulted and robbed.

Both now have holes in them  one on the seem and one where the fabric appears to have split.  I have no idea when these were purchased as I ve been stock piling the larger size for a few months now (clothing growing children is expensive to do in one go!!) but I m really disappointed in the poor quality of these clothes after 2 wears.

Twice you have sent me my monthly savings vouchers after the start date and when I have already done my weekly shop  so I have missed out.   Last month you issued me with a money card to compensate but this time you are telling me that it was a one of goodwill gesture and that this time after just spending ¬£80 in your store you will not honour the ¬£12 voucher that arrived too late to use with my shop. This is not ¬£1 or ¬£2 this is enough to by all months worth of nappies/wipes.  I am now being told I can t complain to anyone else as your twitter employees (probably the same as the people on here) are the end of the line. You have no managers or people higher than those who answer social media posts.   This is what spending ¬£80 week in week out with you gets. No loyalty.   I can see your sending all your lovely online customers nice hampers too. That s great.   Everyweek I shop in your store which is not a pleasant experience  the staff who go round collecting the Internet shopping are rude. Stand around chatting whilst blocking aisles. Your trolleys are dangerous and have no brakes yet show pictures to tell you to enable brakes when you have children in the trolley.   The sole reason I continue to shop in your store is the fact you send out reward vouchers and have a great selection of dairy free products for my son.   However I see no point carrying on spending over a ¬£1000 year with a company who won t even honour vouchers that they send out late.  I ll leave this nice post here for everyone to read. Hopefully someone will respond with a complaints department  if not then at least all of the other customers you cheat out of loyalty vouchers might see it.					2016-12-12T15:56:04+0000	1481558164	2016-12-12 16:56:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought 3 jumpers using my clubcard vouchers and when they arrived one was too small. I popped in store today with the intention of a simple exchange to a different size  but was advised that this is no longer allowed and I needed to return it via click and collect and re-order! Went down to click and collect and the assistant rang through and I was advised that there was nothing they could do except refund my points which would be credited when statement is next due. Because the jumper was bought as part of an offer  I was only refunded 400 points  so now I have no jumper  no points that I can use and I feel completely unsatisfied by your service! Had I known of your new policy I wouldn t have bothered ordering at all! Very disappointed  as is my daughter who now doesn t have the Christmas jumper she wanted for Christmas jumper day at school!					2016-12-12T15:50:25+0000	1481557825	2016-12-12 16:50:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went there to buy my son power ranger toys after looking online and seeing that you sold them. I found a set in the main special season isle that was ¬£18.10  when I paid and checked my receipt it had come up at ¬£35.95  this is the only power ranger toys you had in the whole store. The lady in customer service agreed that it should of been ¬£18.10 after checking the code on the box against the shelf label  how ever Matt on the customer service desk was disagreeing with her saying no it s not that one  this was as I said the only power rangers toys that you had stocked in the shop so it wasn t about if stock product etc. Matt would not honour the the toy at the price it was labelled at and refunded my card rather rudely  when I asked how long it would now take to have the ¬£35.95 refunded back into my account he shrugged and told me to ask my bank  terrible and disappointing service from him. The lady was trying to help and agreed that it was the price advertised!! Very rude service from  Matt  at Tesco bursledon and safe to say I will not be coming back there to be treated so badly when buying shopping.					2016-12-12T15:15:35+0000	1481555735	2016-12-12 16:15:35	0	7	4	0	11	7	2	5	2	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0

When arriving at my local tesco extra with my six month old son. I wanted to use your toilets. There is nowhere for a mum and baby to go the toilet. I could have left my son in his pram outside a cubicle however that wasn t happening. The disabled toilets was locked so I was unable to use them. When I asked about this at the customer service desk. I was told there was nothing they could do. I feel like I have been discriminated against because I have a son in a pram. I then left your store without my shopping. This is shocking customer service.					2016-12-12T15:00:13+0000	1481554813	2016-12-12 16:00:13	2	4	4	0	8	4	4	0	1	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0

I purchased the nappies pictured below and put one on my son  all seemed fine. The next day I continued to use them but when I took one off him in the afternoon his whole bum  nappy line and front area was red raw and blistering! I instantly switched back to pampers and loaded him up with sudocream and after a day or so it s improved drastically. Honestly thought I was going to have to take him to get checked out! Very disappointed as I thought it would be a safe switch since my sons not particularly sensitive. Guess I have to carry on paying pampers prices now in order to save my sons skin!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15355641_10154902718056424_2566425473851816407_n.jpg?oh=d02fad0b5901197fc9d965b17f54cc84&oe=58E19A1F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15355641_10154902718056424_2566425473851816407_n.jpg?oh=ee503790353100f6717c90fe65163bec&oe=58EA4A12	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154902718056424&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-12T14:17:06+0000	1481552226	2016-12-12 15:17:06	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I left my change in the till and walked away but the staff member who had just taken over supervising the tills came running after me to give it back. Just a small thing but very much appreciated by someone who appears to be suffering from  baby brain  kicking in!! I said thank you at the time but just wanted to say it again üòä					2016-12-12T13:53:55+0000	1481550835	2016-12-12 14:53:55	6	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

That s ok I accept your apology. Quarter to 11 I make a phone call to be told that traffic has been terrible and they are running late  no idea what time my delivery will come  but that s ok lovely lady on phone  full of apologises and sent me a ¬£10 voucher. An hour and a half late my delivery finally arrived  yay I can have my breakfast it s finally arrive at the time of 11.30am. No yay  no breakfast as a whole tray of my ambient goods is missing. Lady delivery driver very apologetic but informs me that none of the trays had been labelled properly the poor delivery driver was stressed  she was sent out to help. We work out what is missing and she phones through to arrange a re delivery for me  at which point I am told it will be  this evening . Then phoned helpline  to complain as I feel like I have been more than patient and tolerant and terribly messed around this morning  fortunately I am not working today  but do have plans for this evening. Patrick on helpline said someone would be ringing me back with a delivery time  so I can make sure someone is in and yet I still gave heard nothing üò°üò°üò°üò° I have been having Tesco s deliveries for some time now and had been more than impressed so yesterday signed up for the delivery saver scheme  how ironic is it that today I have been dealt this double whammy  not happy at all üòí #tescos #notimpressed					2016-12-12T12:54:00+0000	1481547240	2016-12-12 13:54:00	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been trying to get them for weeks and despite visits to three local stores no one ever has them in stock. I ve tried numerous times with my online shop too. Due to colitis I had my colon removed  and now I am unable to eat raisins and sultanas which rules out Christmas Cake  Christmas Pudding and mince pies. Food is a huge part of my Christmas so I felt cheated in a way  but when I saw you did a wonderful alternative to mince pies I wanted to try them  but I can t get hold of any!  I live between your Dingwall and Inverness stores......any advice greatly appreciated.					2016-12-12T10:54:15+0000	1481540055	2016-12-12 11:54:15	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My granddaughteras  as she did last year  has been saving her pound corns to buy saving stamps. Last year she managed to save ¬£150 worth of stamps  which bless  she spent it all  at Tesco on Christmas presents for her family and friends. she loved the experience of putting the pound corns in the stamp machine and seeing the stamps coming from the machine and then sticking them in the book and most of all spending them. she would normally get the stamps from little lever Tesco but their machine has been out of action for some time so that s how she ended up going to Farnworth Tesco. My granddaughter went with her grandad she had 42 pound corns and ¬£10 in silver. After she had got 42 stamps she went to customer service and asked if she could exchange the ¬£10 pounds worth of silver for 10 pound corns. her little face when the women said no it s not our policy. By the customer services was not buys at the time. I myself went to store later in the day to make a compliat about Tesco customer serves policy. I spoke to the manager who was unsympathetic towards me granddaughter. I asked if he could give me a web page so I could complain. he said he know it and handed my a little green gard that invited me to do a sUrey with a chance to win ¬£1000. If it wasn t for tha fact that I don t want to disappoint my granddaughter I would redeem the stamps and go else were					2016-12-12T08:55:27+0000	1481532927	2016-12-12 09:55:27	0	7	1	0	8	7	3	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

These loose nuts are at the tills of your Tesco metro  Bradley Stoke store in Bristol.  My son is 4  and suffers from life threatening anaphylaxis allergies  in particular to hazelnuts. He can react to touch and airborne  he doesn t need to consume them  and has almost died from just being near them.  I know a lot of people and children in a similar predicament. I understand your need to sell nuts  and in most stores we can avoid them. But putting them at the tills (at child height) means they re unavoidable üò© as we obviously have to pay for our shopping. Could you please reconsider your placement of loose nuts  and the risk they pose to your customers with nut allergies?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15338796_10154276459397989_5565020078558444380_n.jpg?oh=0b8c81a79893969b9a48d317a4b180c4&oe=591E4F3C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15338796_10154276459397989_5565020078558444380_n.jpg?oh=694e63e1ab19d38c13493bd8fd3816ec&oe=58E6D231	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154276459397989&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-12T01:18:52+0000	1481505532	2016-12-12 02:18:52	6	14	6	6	26	13	3	10	13	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a pair of school shoes from yourselves for my son to wear in September. Now these shoes I ve bought same ones for years as I find they last so well!! But by son came to me last week and told me his sole had split. I was tad shocked to say the least. As the pair he had last year lasted 10 months! And nothing about my child or school has changed! So I m not happy that I now have to buy a new pair! I really hope u haven t changed the material or anything of them. As after looking for so long for a pair of shoes that lasts and doesn t break the bank wasn t easy! Will post a picture later for u. Thanks Vikki.					2016-12-11T23:09:05+0000	1481497745	2016-12-12 00:09:05	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my mum were completing our Christmas shopping  at the tills we got talking to two lovely employees. Chit chat went from one subject to the next and then we found out  they have both served nearly 30 years EACH at Tesco!!! I jokingly said  That ll mean a nice big present from Tesco!   To my surprise they laughed at me and replied  really? We don t even get a Christmas card  I was shocked  how can that be?!   Christmas cards are so cheap these days  I m sure you could even get a mass printed for a good deal. I have around 100 staff members and colleagues that I have hand written cards for  now I know that s a small scale compared to Tesco but I like to show my staff that I appreciate them  they were all thankful!   All I have to say is; shame on you Tesco  shame on you!   Merry Christmas!!!					2016-12-11T21:03:31+0000	1481490211	2016-12-11 22:03:31	6	3	6	0	9	3	2	1	3	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to view my feelings about your Tesco in south wigston. Yesterday (Saturday) it was absolutely diabolical . I always use the scan service  but I had to wait 15 mins before I got s chance  as you had a new person on there who to be fare hadn t a clue! He asked for more help as there must of been at least 10 people waiting. No one helped at all. Your staff particularly at this shop are awful  don t want to help you and standing Looking at their phone rather than help customers. We spend a lot if money in your shops but sometimes don t get the niceness that we should. I do think that some of your staff there are terrible. I could mention names too.

You released dates for click and collect for the Christmas period and I duly booked my slot in the Friday for 16:00 to 18:00 at my local store and thought job done.   Tonight I thought I would start to prepare the Christmas shop and I could not find my slot so I telephoned your customer service line who confirmed the slot was no longer available. The reason why because I did not secure my slot. In order to secure my slot I should have placed an order.   Nowhere in your automated and unpersonalised emails do you state that an order should have been placed to secure the slot. You didn t even mention it on your website when I selected my slot. I hear from your customer service agent that I am not first and probably not the last.

I went in two weeks ago and asked if I could order a rib of people for 8 people  to be collected the day before Christmas Eve. A lady took all my details  double checked that they could offer this service and informed me I could collect it on my desired date. Today I went shopping  as I normally do with yourself ever Sunday  and double checked with your butchers that my order had been received. The lady informed me that I could not preorder meat and they had no record of my order. I am sure you can imagine how glad I am that I double checked and I didn t wait until the 23rd to collect it. I am sure you can imagine the panic that would have been caused. Please could you make sure that all your staff now that this service isn t offered  as I have now got to source meat from elsewhere  adding something back on to my very long Christmas to do list.					2016-12-11T18:08:46+0000	1481479726	2016-12-11 19:08:46	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only does the introduction of Christmas items cause  Free From  items to be moved all over the store and not under  Free From  signage but it also means that you have reduced your already limited range of dairy and soya free items in store.   Having a toddler with a dairy (and possibly soya) allergy is hard enough but when stores stop stocking products it makes it almost impossible. Tesco are by far the most superior supermarket when it comes to  Free From  products but at the moment you are on a par with  if not worse than the other supermarkets. The  Free From  range this week was pretty much non existent  you had no yoghurts  spread and very limited amounts of milk which were both dairy and soya free. To make matters worse a Tesco colleague tried to give me lactose free milk telling me it was the same as dairy free. I have no problem with staff members not knowing which products do or don t contain dairy or soya but when they clearly do not know about dietary needs then they certainly shouldn t be giving out false information and making it up.   There is definitely a gap in the market for dairy and soya free products in general but more specifically those which are targeted at children  it s as if only adults have these allergies. For example my two year old doesn t eat the same amount of yoghurt as an adult in one sitting and putting half a tub into a Tupperware and into the fridge for the next day doesn t work either as the yoghurt separates and goes all funny. And if you have a diary allergy you have to have a very plain palette as the only flavour you can have in anything is coconut. Surely it can t be hard to make a strawberry flavoured milk and soya free yoghurt?   If you could let me know when you plan to reintroduce these products back into store and if you intend to extend the range at any time I would appreciate that.   Thank you					2016-12-11T17:26:35+0000	1481477195	2016-12-11 18:26:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was absolutely HORRIBLE  stank the whole place out ... this is not the first time I have noticed bad hygiene in the toilets at Tesco!! I have seen cleaner toilets in 3rd world countries and festival portaloos ! Considering you sell FOOD this is completely unacceptable and made me feel physically SICK... I have a small child and imagine if he had touched it or knocked it over ! I have sent an email to your complaints department  but I want people to publicly see how atrocious the health and safety is in these toilets	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15439893_1849829545295559_1303527357185912253_n.jpg?oh=776cd61eda26e5f08902ce98e253bd33&oe=58DF0F6F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/15439893_1849829545295559_1303527357185912253_n.jpg?oh=322d8944da18367d4a2a518210631718&oe=59182FE1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1849829545295559&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-11T14:12:54+0000	1481465574	2016-12-11 15:12:54	0	3	2	0	5	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

Just bought a pack of your Luxury Charity cards (Pearl Present six pack) and they seem to be a little bit tipsy!!! On the Bucks Fizz already by the look of it!   Has anyone else found that the inside page greeting has been affixed upside down? Lovely cards but my pack may be a bit duff & five out of the six were squiffy!!   As the money goes to charity I don t mind that much as I just removed the inside page. But it was a little bit random!!!   Of Course if you wish to spread me back some Christmas Spirit a bottle of something that could get me as wonky as these cards would go down nicely!!! Then I could probably read them!!!   Many thanks in advance  Amber.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15356572_10211236140439946_8642883192074054596_n.jpg?oh=3a51e2e94ab125c409f9d2ecf9a07f74&oe=58E50466	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15356572_10211236140439946_8642883192074054596_n.jpg?oh=8080b69b57f3afbc8da52fc188097f58&oe=5920796B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211236140439946&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-11T14:09:03+0000	1481465343	2016-12-11 15:09:03	8	2	10	0	12	2	2	0	2	0	8	1	0	1	0	0	0

As regular Tesco customers we are very disappointed that you have let something like this happen. Not only is this a foreign object it is also a choking hazard. Surely this violates food safety regulations?

We don t go out often as I have social anxiety... and crowds aren t great for me. We ordered the cheeseburger onion rings and chips. (But a plain burger)  and my partner got lasagne and garlic bread.   My meal came wrong. It had Mayo and other bits on. My partner went to tell them as I have bad anxiety. They told him to take it back as it was their mistake.  But the woman then came to us and told us  in future make sure you order what you actually want  and was quite rude. My partner corrected her as we did order correctly. And she was still quite rude saying  well  I didn t serve you did I? who did?   Actually caused me a panic attack.  Pretty upset by the whole ordeal.					2016-12-11T13:48:21+0000	1481464101	2016-12-11 14:48:21	2	3	6	0	9	3	1	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	4	0	0

First of all I don t like you as a retailer but in this day and age I seem to have little choice . Problem is I would like to send my daughter a shopping delivery on the 23rd of December but there are no slots? Can you not increase your staff to ensure we have deliveries after all you can well afford it! As a customer I expect a better service. Skye has free deliveries and yet it can cost anything up to ¬£5 to get a delivery from Huntly  to Whitehills. Wonder if the Co op in Banff would do a delivery for me? No store in Skye no running a costs apart from the fleet of vans. Why would you ever bother to build a store in Skye and put a bit back into the community? Just leaving a trail packaging and nothing else!!					2016-12-11T13:47:55+0000	1481464075	2016-12-11 14:47:55	3	17	4	0	21	17	8	9	42	0	3	0	0	1	0	0	0

I was due to pick up my groceries click & collect order today at my local store.  However my daughter had been vomiting during the night and still sickly this morning as a single parent I wasn t able to make my pick up.  After speaking to an advisor  they said don t worry well get a driver to drop it off  within 20 mins of the call the driver was at my door.  I am so grateful for your help today. Excellent service and much appreciated					2016-12-11T11:57:28+0000	1481457448	2016-12-11 12:57:28	6	2	6	0	8	2	1	1	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Collection fine but on opening the packaging at home  found the box had already been opened (sellotape ripped and box torn) and the razor contents not in the correct positions in the base.  One cleaning brush not even in a cellophane bag and the charger had been taken out of its bag and not replaced - the empty bag was there for all to see.  Unfortunately had to give this  poor  specimen to the recipient (time constraints) with profuse apologies.  Is this your way of getting rid of damaged goods? I will not be shopping on line again with you - suggest everyone be aware and buy in stores where you can actually see the item you are buying.  Not impressed Tesco!					2016-12-11T11:38:59+0000	1481456339	2016-12-11 12:38:59	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What I didn t expect was to find a microwaved ladybird in my pilau rice. I m not sure about the flavourings of these Indian meals  but surely this isn t a new special seasoning you re now offering?

Currently 17 weeks pregnant and struggled too lift up one of the items I was purchasing. One of the lovely members of staff from the Maldon Tesco was kind enough to carry the item to the check out for me while I had the rest if my shopping and pushing a pram and also out of the store while I was waiting for my taxi.

Today I purchased a Xmas jumper from your bursledon store - it was supposed to be a Xmas robin however.... my friends mocked me all evening suggesting it looks like a Xmas poo!!!  I therefore asked numerous people on route down the high street as was told it looked like a turkey  an owl and again a slightly more graphic word for pop!!!! I m mortified!!!!!!! What do I do???! I have tagged the guilty mocking bullying friends! Hopefully their guilt will encourage an apology for their meanness!!!

This is particularly difficult for me to see the products as i have an eye condition.

The next day I called to cancel the order and it took me well over an hour and asking three times to speak to a manager who was most unhelpful and frankly deserves a complaint against him but wanted to get the cancellation sorted first. Three days later after again hearing nothing from you I called in again  actually got the order cancelled this time but the refund has taken four days to get back into my bank and has come in ¬£20 short!!!

I ve bought joints at a comparative price  not on special offer  from your competitors which have far exceeded the quality of the two joints I ve bought from you.

I live above a pub and some times I don t get my orders delivered. This exactly what Asda did and this made me go Tesco.

I purchased a high value  Christmas present on 25th Nov - was due to be delivered within 3-5days  no sign. After emailing customer services apparently the delivery driver could not find the address/there was no one there to receive the item - there had been someone at the property on every single one of his  attempted  deliveries.  It was then advised that he had left a card at the address he was attempting to deliver at which was clearly incorrect  according to Tesco we needed to retrieve this card... how/why??? I provided a correct address  why is it my responsibility to figure out where the delivery driving is attempting to deliver to?!  Anyway we did  the property we believed they were attempting to deliver to was vacant so no way we could retrieve the card but a note was left saying call this no. if you are attempting to deliver said item for Tesco.  It was then advised by Tesco we would be contacted directly by the courier - this didn t happen.  After lots of back & fourth we were advised firstly that Tesco could not get a response from there courier - my options were... wait & see if it gets delivered before Christmas  or get a refund as the item was sold out & they couldn t guarantee it would be back in stock before Christmas.   Obviously I was not happy with this  found the item elsewhere at a much higher value & requested from Tesco they reimburse the difference - not possible  this is against company policy  obviously!  In the meantime I was advised by one of Tesco s customer service advisors on twitter that my item had infact been lost by Yodel  whilst on the same day a different customer service advisor advised me via email that they would attempt to redeliver next week...  if this is not the height of embarrassment for such a big  trusted brand as Tesco I don t know what is.  I really cannot believe the service I ve received!  & I still have to wait 3-5 days for my refund of ¬£400 to be processed - money which they have had for 15days without me receiving my item!  I m hoping by putting this post of facebook I will receive a more appropriate response than I have thus far!  üò°					2016-12-10T19:23:41+0000	1481397821	2016-12-10 20:23:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered an item from direct to be delivered instore ready for collection after 3pm today. I phoned the store to make sure it was there before I made the journey to collect it. I was told initially that it was delivered instore at 10 this morning but hasn t been processed instore yet. Then I was later told by someone else that my item isn t even there and it was accidently sent to another store by mistake. I told them I needed it by today which is why I ordered it woth you  as I am due to have a c-section for my twins on Monday morning and today is the only day I can collect it. The guy at the store I was suppose to collect it at was obviously trying to wind me up knowing I was angry about the situation you guys left me in. He had me repeat my order number literally 20 times pretending that he can t hear me   before telling me he can t find it and then without saying another word he put phone down on desk and talked amongst colleagues and customers. I ended up phoning direct and cancelling my order completely. Never again will I order from you if you cant do something as simple as send it to the correct store.					2016-12-10T17:44:05+0000	1481391845	2016-12-10 18:44:05	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I went in to my local store just recently  I noticed the new Black Forest tarts. After taking my first bite I knew these where special. I am loving them.

I bought 2 Felix boxes and 1 Sheba. But I wasn t given the ¬£2.50 discount at the till. When I complained in store  the employee first said the Sheba boxes aren t in the ¬£10 offer  they re 2 for ¬£7. But I checked the pet aisle and there was a 3 for 10 offer on selected Shebas listed. I asked again and she said you re not allowed to mix brands under the offer. ¬£2.50 is a lot to me so I would like it back.					2016-12-10T16:54:55+0000	1481388895	2016-12-10 17:54:55	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What a joke that turned out to be! Time passes well after 7 days calls tesco to be told we have to call a company sports hq! fine called them said it was delivered?! lies!! They read out our address house number 1/1 when my fiance tried to explain to the person on the call that there is no house number 1/1 that is our flat number and gave them the correct house number no one could understand what my fiance was going on about!! They put him on hold for god knows how long only to be hung up on! When he called back another person didnt understand what we were trying to explain! Its not that hard!! After about an hour and half on the phone we were told to call sports hq. Got a girl on the phone who said it was sent back to the warehouse but they have to wait till its signed as back before they can re send it to the correct address. Fine waited passed another week still nothing! Called sports hq back was advised it still hasn t been signed back and theres nothing they could do! At this point i asked for a refund I was then put on hold when the girl came back she said she could send one out just now and we would get it in 2 days! So how is this possible if it wasn t back in the warehouse yet??! We decided to go ahead with the refund was told 3-5 working days that had passed still nothing! We then got a text from Tesco this week asking to call them to give card details called them said they don t give the refund sports hq do? SERIOUSLY eventually after having to repeat the card number 5 TIMES then being passed to another department to also repeat the card number it was resolved expected 3-5 working days this isn t good enough Tesco I will never shop with you again if this is how you treat your customers unbelievable!!					2016-12-10T15:45:47+0000	1481384747	2016-12-10 16:45:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Nothing has yet been done about this  and if it isn t rectified by next week  I will have to move my weekly shopping to Sainsburies which is considerably further away  but at least I can get clean bread without the chance that it has been mauled.  Will this be looked at or at least considered?  I ll update next Saturday either way.					2016-12-10T13:33:35+0000	1481376815	2016-12-10 14:33:35	3	9	3	0	12	9	1	8	5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 11 year old son was with his nan with the intent to buy his younger brother a present for Xmas. Nan had gone to the toilet and my son and found a box of lego he liked to buy his brother and went to wait for his nan to return from the toilet at the front of the store with the box to show her what he had found. It was here he was approached and stopped by the duty manager who then accused my son of stealing!!! His reason for doing so was my son had passed all points for method of payment yet hadn t actually left the premises! How can an 11 year old child that is making no attempt to run no attempt to conceal or hide the product and no attempt to leave the premises be accused of theft? If the product hasn t left the store surely it can t be classed as stolen!! When my wife went to the store to complain she was told by the duty manager that he was  preventing an incident !!! No you ve had made a very bad judgement!! My son is devastated that he has been accused of being a thief and very upset by the whole incident. Tesco you really do need to educate your staff a little bit better with the law as if the police would have been called they would have simply agreed with us that the product hadn t left the store so no crime has been committed.  We will be contacting head office to make a complaint as well					2016-12-10T13:32:14+0000	1481376734	2016-12-10 14:32:14	2	7	6	0	13	7	6	1	2	0	2	0	1	0	0	3	0

Both Tubs next to each other shelf marked ¬£2.00 or two for ¬£3.00 This is normal for these buy this combination every year. But when I got home found the bill did not reflect the offer.  Phone the tel no on the receipt to be told they are not on the same deal  and that I would need to return to the store for a refund.  The store is a 12 mile round trip and told head office so  she said thats what I have to do but  I do have so many days to do this  the amount of days I can t remember.

Good luck to everyone. Nothing is more annoying than when you want to select your numbers only to find that the pen/pens/ attached to the table has/have/ been removed. I had to ask a cashier for one to borrow instead. This happens regularly at my local (Paddington Metro Branch) Tesco and I m certain all the other stores have this too. I ll have to make sure that I have my own pen to hand just in case this happens unless you do the necessary at home. .					2016-12-10T13:11:31+0000	1481375491	2016-12-10 14:11:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What an utterly ridiculous way of working  and the customer service was very poor  he hadn t even been bothered to inform us they were not in stock  and surely if something isn t in stock it should say so on the shelf. And the empty boxes removed. I understand it s a very busy period for your store but to not even bother coming back and letting us know they were not in stock is not acceptable.					2016-12-10T13:02:23+0000	1481374943	2016-12-10 14:02:23	1	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a pensioner to feed and now have to change my plans because you cannot get your act together. Do you not have contingency plans for when you have supposed system issues   clearly not ! I suggest you get some sorted and sharpish. I have been a very loyal client of yours - putting up with late deliveries ( some very late)  missing items  items that were not mine  ridiculous substitutions that don t make sense on the most basic of things( replacing Imodium with 6 bagels- i guess I was supposed to shove those where the problem was)  rude drivers  drivers that do not know where they are going  stupid texts telling me you ll be late when.... you already are. Actuality I ve been pretty laid back about it. I wonder how you have affected the disabled and those unable to get the necessities in order to live. I suggest you rethink your ¬£10 offer for something that reflects the issues you have caused me  or I shall consider taking my custom elsewhere in the New Year!					2016-12-10T12:46:51+0000	1481374011	2016-12-10 13:46:51	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not for much longer  I m afraid!  I PRICE COMPARED Asda and Tesco on 25 items (the usual toilet rolls  cleaning products  veg  coffee etc).  ASDA cost 50.98 and Tesco came in at a whopping 58.30!  There were a lot of things I couldn t compare  simply because they seem to have a policy of packaging things in different sizes (so you can t compare  I suspect!).  So  ASDA is definitely winning my online shopping from now on!

I wanted to express my thanks to Tesco direct staff from the call centre who the other day went above and beyond to sort a problem out for me which really they didn t have to do.  On another note I wanted to say how I didn t appreciate being spoken to like a 5 year old by Maldon tesco direct staff and that if they are in a customer service role they may wish to  re  evaluate how they talk to people. They definately need some lessons in customer care!					2016-12-10T12:07:34+0000	1481371654	2016-12-10 13:07:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I do this because I have to order large amounts of Dairy Free milk for my daughter to tide us over and thus save me numerous trips to the Supermarket (where I inevitably spend more!) . I very clearly have added notes in the  notes  section to not offer Dairy  Soya or Coconut alternatives if my milk is unavailable  (leaving Almond  Hazlenut or Hemp). Imagine my annoyance today when my husband has gone to collect to find 6 of the milks replaced with Soya ones? He was given a refund but we need the milk not the refund. (He didn t deal with it particularly well by just accepting this but that s a separate issue!). It s very inconvenient and renders the notes section pointless if our requests aren t going to be acknowledged.					2016-12-10T11:53:26+0000	1481370806	2016-12-10 12:53:26	0	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I am a wheelchair user  and the staff could not be more helpful. I often need them to get things off of higher shelves and  even when extremely busy  are more than happy to help. One lady  jane  always asks if I need help as soon as she sees me. They always have a smile on their faces. They make me feel like I am not a nuisance  which cannot be said in other stores in town. You have such wonderful staff  they are a godsend.  Yours  paula dickson					2016-12-10T07:55:55+0000	1481356555	2016-12-10 08:55:55	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s just taken me around an hour and a half to order and pay for 4 items. It was very slow and then when it asked me to sign in I couldn t remember my password so had to reset it but it wouldn t let me and it kept saying my postcode was invalid. I finally managed to update it and sign in and then when I got to the delivery section it had my old address  which I have tried to delete many times! I moved from there 2 and a half years ago!! I ended up having to select click and collect instead of home delivery because it would have been delivered to my old address otherwise! Then I noticed my very old mobile number was on there and it wouldn t let me change that either! It also said my title was  MR.  It s put me off ever ordering from yourselves again.

I would screenshot it but apparently the app security settings do not let me. I have had to log onto the mobile website to then process the payment instead. As far as I am aware no settings etc have changed on my phone so baffled why this error message.					2016-12-09T22:09:39+0000	1481321379	2016-12-09 23:09:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

First time was some finding dory plastic mugs the ticket said ¬£2.50 however got to the till scanned through at ¬£5 each. So instead of honouring the ticket price (which is what is meant to happen) they just took them off my bill and put to one side. Second time I went in there was tinsel in a box with a massive ¬£1 sign on each side of said red box  I thought till I ll have some of that. Again got to the till scanned in at ¬£3 (I was not paying ¬£3) so again instead of honouring the price the staff member took it off my bill and removed all the tinsel out of that box. To say I m embarrassed is an understatement. For example of how it should be done  went into sainsburys and brought some yogurts the ticket said ¬£1.50 (sale price) came through the till at ¬£2 spoke to the cashier and the supervisor went and checked (like I would expect) came back and reduced the price to what the ticket said. Now can you explain why tescos can t stick to this.					2016-12-09T21:57:42+0000	1481320662	2016-12-09 22:57:42	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every time Tesco reduces this type of product they cover up the allergen advice leaving only the may contain visible. Meaning I m now really sick because I wrongly assumed it was fine for me to eat. Please tell the designers of the labels to think about placing the allergen advice together and the staff to not cover it up when they reduce things. Because I could only see stuff saying it may contain so I thought that meant there was nothing to worry about.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15349769_10211280931759942_3167213040359892560_n.jpg?oh=f5f29960a2ee9c92070265484825e6a7&oe=591A35B6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15349769_10211280931759942_3167213040359892560_n.jpg?oh=be48e4121d476d185937d844ef03d5a2&oe=58E3A7BB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211280931759942&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-09T20:34:18+0000	1481315658	2016-12-09 21:34:18	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I d like to say it was quick   easy and convenient however it was anything but. Because the shopping is brought over from the Bognor Regis store there is no proper area for collection   just a signpost in the car park where the van pulls up. There are no proper facilities which means it s dark. Very dark. There are no lights and the car park lighting is useless as it is too far away.   Luckily it wasn t raining as there is no cover either. The driver does his best with a pocket torch but you cannot see in the crates   cannot see your shopping to check it and cannot see inside the car to pack it.  It s dangerous   lazy and totally unacceptable from a brand like Tesco. Please do something about it as soon as possible.					2016-12-09T19:56:54+0000	1481313414	2016-12-09 20:56:54	6	2	6	0	8	2	2	0	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

What they don t say is if you have use your card at other outlets or even Tesco fuel/Opticians etc  you must pay the whole balance when you monthly statement arrives  including the Tesco Store purchase otherwise you will incur interest from the purchase date  regardless of the  Apparent Offer .  I m sure this won t be displayed long  so please share with your friends and family so they don t get caught out at Christmas. This could be a genuine mistake by senior management and I m sure they will rectify their misrepresentation.					2016-12-09T19:45:54+0000	1481312754	2016-12-09 20:45:54	1	4	1	1	6	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I expect he was from the Tunbridge Wells branch as he drove past us at about 11.45/50 heading from Groombridge towards Tunbridge Wells. He was quite a young guy with dark hair and I was so impressed with his driving and consideration for us and I really want him to know that I appreciated his driving.

And whilst he was happily munching away he started crying and coughing after examining his mouth i found this piece of bone or it is something of the same consistency and also quite sharp.

You say I was unable to supply photographic I.D. and / or my payment card.  I have supplied both !!  On 3 separate occasions today.  The problem was  I was asked to put my card in the card reader and punch in the pin number( this doesn t work because the card is old and worn and it suits me because I never use it at ATM s etc.)  When I received confirmation of the transaction( see below ) it clearly states that I need to bring the card used in the transaction.................Nowhere does it mention pin numbers etc.  Collecting your order  The person whose credit/debit card was used to pay for the order must be the person who collects the order and they must bring the following:  Order confirmation number  A valid photo ID (UK Photographic Driving Licence  Passport or EU ID card)  The credit/debit card used to pay for this order Pick up date: Pick up point location: After 2pm on 09/12/2016 Ilkeston - Tesco - Extra  Rutland street  DE7 8DG  I have contacted my bank  HSBC who have confirmed that Tesco have had my money since yesterday.  As Tesco are unwilling to carry out the agreed transaction that I have already paid for and are unwilling to give me my money back now ( only after 10 days !!!) we are unable to afford to go on holiday now.  I have just rang our friends to explain that we will not be picking them up later as agreed ( to go on holiday ) so they will have to book a taxi or some alternative.  So ! because of Tesco we have lost our money  our holiday and some good friends.  HSBC are to contact their fraud squad as they can see that a transaction has been attempted during my third visit to Tescos today  Would you say Tesco are committing fraud ??  Or just downright criminal ??  Your thoughts ?  Richard Fleckney					2016-12-09T17:54:23+0000	1481306063	2016-12-09 18:54:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When a member of staff cheeked when they would be in stock again she informed me they weren t even on order. How can u sell the cigarette and run out of the tips. I m so disappointed I ended up buying a real packet of cigarettes until I found somewhere else that stocked them. How can people be expected to give up when the main store don t support you					2016-12-09T17:27:44+0000	1481304464	2016-12-09 18:27:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Pretty obvious this is coming from above - some area manager type - and not the store itself.  If the excuse is because  nobody fills it  - obviously - we never see it there for any consistent period of time.  You seem to have endless loops of Christmas cheer thanks to the cd player in the corner blasting away the same Christmas Songs year on year but you seem to be lacking on the goodwill and charity.  Please can you make sure that the Food Bank point is in place at this time of year. I would like to deposit in it and seeing as this is my local store I don t see why it s unreasonable to question as to why I am unable to do so.

I was told that farmers are not allowed to export live calves on welfare grounds which i agree with .So why is it that the same farms can import cattle from Europe surely imported cattle should be as important to the welfare of these animals  whos products appear in yr supermarkets					2016-12-09T13:56:56+0000	1481291816	2016-12-09 14:56:56	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked if I can raise this as a complaint I was told no but I can send your feed back . I asked to be called back regarding this to be told it wasn t possible. I have spent over 600 pounds in Tesco over the last four weeks alone and I m not impressed by the loyalty the company has given me or lack of opportunity to complain. Maybe I need to consider shopping else where!					2016-12-09T13:46:13+0000	1481291173	2016-12-09 14:46:13	0	13	0	0	13	13	4	9	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a petrol lawnmower from you earlier in the year and it stopped working. After having the run around for 30 minutes trying to find the department responsible you eventually told me I had to ring the manufacturer  MTD. Fair enough  even though my warranty is with you  this might be the easiest route to take. I rang them and they said I had to take it to my local agent  which I did  and now I have still not heard back from them for two weeks   despite leaving an ansafone message every day. I know it is not your fault that the engineers are behaving in this unprofessional  way but my warranty is with you  not them  and I would like to be treated better.  If I wanted to be treated shabbily I  would have bought from a shabby company  but I love Tesco customer service so I bought from Tesco.

Practically every aisle was full of trolleys of stock which I appreciate replenishing is done in quiet periods.   I get that   honest I do (I worked in retail for numerous years) what I don t get is the need to cram numerous trolleys laden with stock up against the very stock you want me to buy.

I ve sent an enquiry through the website & had no reply  so thought I d try here. I ordered something on 5/12 for store collection which said it would be available 7/12. Still nothing. Tracking shows it was with your carrier that day & nothing has been updated on the tracking & no update on my order at all either since. I wouldn t even mind  but the reason I ordered from you & not Argos was as from you it was going to be an earlier collection. Can you look into this for me please? Order number is 4FFN3MQTT.

In a circumstance reminiscent of the famous case of Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)UKHL100 which changed the UK law on product liability  I was sipping from my can of sugar free KX. Reaching the last few mouthfuls  I tipped the can up to drink  and a foreign object tapped against my tongue. Fortunately  unlike the unfortunate Mrs Donoghue  the intruder turned out not to be a snail  but part of the core of an apple  or similar fruit  with the stem attached. Since fruit is not listed as an ingredient  I assume this was spat or dropped into the brew during the manufacturing process. Photos attached. Please look into this.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15326364_10154828793944529_388228639476073316_n.jpg?oh=f6c00e1ba494e1f9416a252761e201dc&oe=5921EB23	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15326364_10154828793944529_388228639476073316_n.jpg?oh=91c32926ade262d3f3832b142d87459c&oe=58D64C36	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154828793944529&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-09T09:54:02+0000	1481277242	2016-12-09 10:54:02	0	10	3	1	14	10	5	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0

However  I am falling out with you. My local tiny tesco and eddie stobart seems to not be able to read. Or see. How is it safe to park a bloody great lorry across the car park that is directly across from school??? At school time??? Granted  sometimes it doesn t move (sometimes it does  tut tut)  but it s still in the way. I know you can t block the street behind  but that s why there are restrictions  when there are fewer people using the car park and road. Cars can sometimes get round  but pedestrians can t see them How come I have to report this 3 weeks on the bounce and it still happens??? Stobart tell me they are looking into it  but what does it take other than READ THE DELIVERY NOTE AND FOLLOW IT!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15349769_10154854609579292_8843628236454496987_n.jpg?oh=b061939a0d560cfd2e4312a36f451865&oe=58E7A5CA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15349769_10154854609579292_8843628236454496987_n.jpg?oh=d0968846332115c46e12121059732610&oe=591B34C7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154854609579292&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-09T09:43:31+0000	1481276611	2016-12-09 10:43:31	3	4	4	0	8	4	1	3	0	0	3	0	0	1	0	0	0

The other who came and served herself some lunch not even acknowledging the long que - after a 10 minute wait we eventually got served - no apology or acknowledgement we had been waiting! The floor was filthy - even in the kitchen where you could see in (I wouldn t be surprised if you get shut down for health and safety soon) and this was the state of the food - who even knows what the burnt thing trying to be served is meant to be? Safe to say we won t be returning here anytime soon!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15355810_10153956687005493_8262181199076547400_n.jpg?oh=484f52d72e49c266da1d6db3eb7a87a9&oe=592480CD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15355810_10153956687005493_8262181199076547400_n.jpg?oh=76b069dca0ff5de5228af61799bf7d4e&oe=58DBDAC0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153956687005493&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-09T00:16:53+0000	1481242613	2016-12-09 01:16:53	2	3	5	0	8	3	3	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	3	0

It is only attached with a small bit of cotton. It is a really bad design and should have been a lot lower down on the jumper for safety reasons.

I love the fact you deliver me food so I don t have to shop with 3 small children. I love club card points. And I used to love Tesco direct! I live in Orkney and on the 29th November  went on a road trip to the big smoke that is Inverness  so I visited Tesco  as you do  and saw a vacuum that was on offer  my mum has been needing a new vacuum so I thought it was perfect. As my car was already quite full I went to one of your fancy machines and ordered the vacuum to be delivered to Kirkwall store when I got home.  On 3rd December I got a text to say it arrived. I was delighted. So today I set off to Kirkwall to collect the vacuum only to be told once I got there that it wasn t in store. I advised that I got a text  showed them my text but no the text was wrong the vacuum was not there I would have to go back another day. When I got home I thought surely nearly a week after I got the text my order must have arrived so I phoned Tesco direct who checked with the store and low and behold it is there!!! So now I need to do another hours round trip to go and collect it. Very very annoying!					2016-12-08T20:34:53+0000	1481229293	2016-12-08 21:34:53	0	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0

I just wanted to say thanks for yet again moving all your shelves around. I have just spent an enjoyable ten minutes trying to locate an item that I wanted to just quickly  pop in  to purchase. Luckily I spent the time usefully buying items I accidentally came across  that I didn t even know I needed when I went in... Wait  that last bit is not true.... Actually I just got irritated & left the store with a mental note to walk the extra few yards to Sainsbury next time as they don t waste god only knows how much time & money!? unnecessarily moving their stock around! Ridiculous!					2016-12-08T19:58:11+0000	1481227091	2016-12-08 20:58:11	5	11	5	0	16	11	6	5	5	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

A staff member has taken a look and cannot find them and so I am told they are out of stock and they are not willing to search for them any further.  This is unacceptable.

Missed 3 attempts as they didn t let us choose redelivery dates (and not everyone is able to stay in 7am-7pm short notice)   and when they did let us choose and we did stay in   they did not show up! Called and the unprofessional call handler blamed it on the holding centre saying they d made their notes and they d held their end up   and to cap it all we ve had to cancel plans to stay in tomorrow now.

We ve waited for a few weeks for this game to come back in stock. Finally order it after a stock notification for click and collect for collection today. After checking the live tracker (and not getting any notification about this) we were slightly annoyed to find the item had been delivered to the wrong store.   After a lengthy call to customer service to presumably just arrange the correct delivery I am  told that the item is now out of stock and I cant receive the one that has been delivered to the wrong store  as it doesn t work like that . All I can do is wait until its back in stock (which I have to keep tabs on) and then call and re-order it! With no idea if and when it will be back in stock before Christmas. Terrible service.   Can you explain how the one that has been delivered to the wrong store cannot simply be redirected to the correct place?!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15391057_10100494652072921_8099117569961742130_n.jpg?oh=92754320b1e9a5ed8125b99ec03a4fac&oe=58EB0AEB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15391057_10100494652072921_8099117569961742130_n.jpg?oh=c82f154faa2f710376ed6065789d45aa&oe=58DF71E6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100494652072921&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-08T17:20:27+0000	1481217627	2016-12-08 18:20:27	9	11	9	1	21	11	5	6	2	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

It got delivered today and it s white!  We ordered silver. Was told oh that model isn t available in silver today. So why was it ordered and why does the image online portray a silver dryer? (False advertising at its finest)  I want to return it but your colleague said it can t as it not a team score product. The company you deal with want to charge me ¬£40 for the pleasure. I wouldn t mind but I should have been told at the point of sale that it was non refundable to you. I would have never brought it had I known.  I m stuck between a rock and a hard place with this.   I should have been told that this was the case and now you won t help rectify the problem. Bad  customer service.  So much for every little helps. I would appreciate any help as the staff in store are less than helpful as are the company that you deal with.					2016-12-08T13:23:11+0000	1481203391	2016-12-08 14:23:11	0	15	0	0	15	15	2	13	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This morning I went to an empty check out  there was a cashier and a member of staff in a jacket so I am assuming a member of management  they were having a moan about progression within the company. I honestly thought that when they saw me  the customer they would stop their conversation and  serve me. Obviously I must be delusional as they carried on chatting while scanning my items not once was I acknowledged  or spoken to. As I paid my bill I politely reminded them they are there for their customers including me who they had ignored.......not even going to go on with what was said back apart from the Sarcastic   Happy Christmas Madam  .

Got no text or email but yesterday it said the stuff was finally there. Walked all the way down there and they cant find the parcel. Customer care said they would look into it and watch the cctv yesterday today they clearly couldn t be bothered nothing we ordered is in stock so we have to wait for a refund and won t be able to get the stuff as it was a 3 for 2 deal which will leave an upset little boy this Christmas.

It got worse when I went to pa: the lady on the checkout barely acknowledged me while she finished her conversation with her neighbouring colleague  and the inclusion of the phrase  I might go over there and not work  after all they all come over here and do that  made me feel really uncomfortable. I accept your staff need to socialise  we all like a bit of shopfloor chit-chat  but twice today it meant that they ignored a customer.					2016-12-08T09:44:44+0000	1481190284	2016-12-08 10:44:44	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you please advise the position regarding why Tesco Harford Norwich petrol station keeps closing in the evening. My wife has been twice on a Thursday night between 9 and 10pm to find the entrance coned over and last Thursday was forced to pay a 9ppl premium at our local garage instead due to the closure. I thought perhaps you were awaiting a delivery. However I had the same thing at 10.20 pm last night  entrance coned over but noted there was no employee in the kiosk so you must be closed even though it s supposed to be 24 hr pay at pump there was no access to the pumps. I have travelled to work this morning with my fuel light on so I haven t had to pay 9ppl more too.					2016-12-08T07:21:25+0000	1481181685	2016-12-08 08:21:25	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

HALF of the  sweet potato mash  is in fact normal potato so sweet potato mash isn t actually sweet potato mash. It s sweet potato and potato mash ? 45 % sweet potato 45% potato NOT sweet potTo mash as far as I am concerned is this against trade description rules  as it s advertised as one thing but is patently another Why do you keep putting cheaper ingredients in  if I buy sweet potato mash I expect it to be sweet mash wont be buying that again - incredibly dissappointed customer					2016-12-08T07:09:33+0000	1481180973	2016-12-08 08:09:33	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I usually buy my petrol  food and most toys etc through you  not any more.  The customer service is absolutely disgusting you are forced to wait hours arguing on the phone only for the things you have agreed to never happen and constantly being let down while they hold onto your money.    I order 2 bikes for the children  they loose not one but both of them  do they call you to tell you  no they wait till nearly a week later when you chase where they are to tell you.  One of the bikes is now out of stock and there are no  suitable  alternatives.  You eventually agree (after a lot of complaining) they will keep your money and email you when it is back in stock.  Do they no  when I checked on Friday it was in stock  I wait till Sunday for an email which doesn t come so I called only to find out it is out of stock again.  So I complain again  I am advised they will give me a ¬£10 good will gesture - I am not interested in money I want my bike which was heavily discounted due to the pre Black Friday sales  if I simply got a refund I am NOW not going to get anywhere as cheap.  He asks what he can do I advise you can get me a suitable alternative at which point he tries to push several boys bikes as a replacement for the GIRLS bike I have purchased.  The only alternative is ¬£50 more which he can t match so I advise if you can t get me a bike then get someone who can.  He agrees as every manager is far too busy to speak to a customer that has already had to complain twice they will call me back.  Nearly 5 hours later I get a call back by which point I am more than a little angry. After much discussion she agrees to match the more expensive bike due to the extremely poor service but as it is sold by a partner I have to pay initially and then get a refund which I agree to  this should be processed in three days.  By Wednesday I have received no refund so I call back to explain I have an email agreeing to refund the price match but no refund for the original bike which I have now paid twice for.  I explain this 6 times to an operator who clearly is not listening to me and sounds like he had just woken up before being put on hold three times to  check this  he eventually agrees to return the original cost of the bike.  I ask for confirmation that the ¬£50 has already been processed at which point he gets completely confused with what I am talking  about  here is where I admit I completely loose it - I have spent half an hour on the phone explaining and repeating a story which should be clear from the notes what has happened and agreed  and he hasn t listened to a word.  He then puts me on hold again to come back and tell me they don t price match so they would never have agreed to do this.  I am clearly banging my head against a brick wall with this one so ask for another manager at which point he asks  can I ask why  REALLY.  Once again they are all to busy to speak to me but I make it quite clear there is no way I am getting off the phone with out speaking to some one they eventually come on the phone to tell me they need to wait to speak to the person who it was agreed with - sorry it is not my problem that your staff are incapable of making notes to explain what has happened and I am not waiting another day for this to be sorted.  It finally appears to have been but only after me chasing  pushing and complaining wasting my time and effort on something so simple.  I am now out of pocket more money than what both bikes cost me in the first place and have to wait another 3-5 days to get my money back.  What a joke  this is not the first time you have disappointed on orders last year I was told 2 days before my daughters birthday you had lost one of her presents and it was out of stock.  I am a firm believer of giving someone another chance but this time has just shown you don t care at all about your customers.  I am sure you won t miss one very loyal customer  but I will tell everyone about my disgusting experience with you.					2016-12-08T05:49:31+0000	1481176171	2016-12-08 06:49:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Since you re asking  I m just about DEMENTED - with YOU! Let me explain.   For at least the past 5 years I have religiously shopped in my local Tesco store. Let s say I spend  on average  ¬£120 a week  that s a total of ¬£41 650...(OMG  I had no idea it would be that much..)  Being such a loyal customer  I make use of your clubcard scheme. I have been saving my vouchers up all year  eagerly anticipating spending them on Christmas. So  suitably prepared  I did some online shopping to help Santa out. Everything went well  I placed my order  shut the lid on the laptop  poured a nice glass of wine (purchased from Tesco) and sat back to relax knowing that Christmas was all wrapped up....Well  almost.  I received an email a couple of days later explaining that You were very sorry  but part of the order I placed and You accepted could not be delivered  I m assuming due to stock issues. Not to worry  I thought  I ll get that one other item elsewhere and You can refund my vouchers.  A couple of days later  I open the faithful laptop to order yet another item from Tesco  at the checkout  I was dismayed to find that I couldn t pay with my remaining Clubcard Vouchers  because You hadn t replaced them. I phoned your helpline and spoke with a very helpful lady who explained that the points would be added onto my statement in February....February!!?? That s no good  I need them now  I ve spent ¬£41 650 in your store and funds are running a wee bitty low. The lady on the phone was very helpful  she said she would send me a Money Card number along with a pin and I could purchase my wares online again.  So  myself and the trusty laptop begun our mission to order a lovely Tesco Christmas dinner. We loaded the cart  picked a delivery slot  added the carrier bags....Guess what happened when we got to the checkout? That s right..! We couldn t pay with the gift/money card.  Now  call me old fashioned  but since Tesco made the error in the original online purchase  surely  considering my previous loyal payments of ¬£41 650 (I still can t believe that number...)  you should be helping me out.....please..  So Tesco  I m going to sit down now with another lovely glass of your relaxing wine and wait for you to get back to me on how best we can sort this out - time is running short to make sure I have all the Extra Special ingredients to WOW my family and friends on the big day.

I did a big she to use my Tesco Vouchers up. The girl at the till could use her right arm so it was very slow & she kept asking the lady on the next till out. I got all the shopping put away. Gave my Tesco card & vouchers.  She was having trouble getting them to scan with just the one arm & hand .I did try to hold them down while she scan it. It was only when I got home I realised only ¬£37.50 had been used instead of ¬£42.50. Can you do anything please as I have had my last pay day till the 10th January. Thanks.

Your soy milk was 75p  at least during this entire year. I ve always liked it because it tasted better than other soy milks. Then  all of a sudden  the price has been increased to 85p  even 89p in Tescos Express. I found it unfair  but kept buying it. I ve just been to my local Tesco and seen that the same soy milk that yesterday was 89p is now 95p!!!! Are you crazy? Do you really think that people will keep buying a product that is not even organic when places like Aldi the same product for way less? Not to mention that the taste was different lately.

We used it for  the first time for a family birthday celebration. Ordering on line was very straight forward and it was delivered to a weekend holiday house in a very rural location 10 minutes earlier than the delivery slot. The driver was friendly and very helpful. The food was excellent. All with instructions for heating and meats and salads nicely packed and presented.  It certainly made life easy and we were able to choose something for everyone of the ten of us  including teens and toddlers. Would not hesitate to recommend it and use it again. Thanks Tesco  not always my favourite shop  but praise when it is due.					2016-12-07T18:01:15+0000	1481133675	2016-12-07 19:01:15	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was not aware that you had this promotion running but I was surprised when I saw this fly was a freebie!!   As much as I am sure that it contains plenty of protein  I am not a great fan of baked  boiled  roasted or fried flys. That may be a delicacy in some countries but I m not sure that they are in the U.K.    I will be happy to pass on this free gift to environmental health and also to inform the staff of the store where purchased  that they really should make their customers aware of any free gifts that are available with their purchases. I am sure that some people love flys cooked in whatever way they choose to cook it.   Once again I d like to thank you and take this opportunity to wish you all a Merry Christmas.   Yours sincerely  Jeni Murray.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15284137_1869638396599162_3604192822861659861_n.jpg?oh=ef7acf28a7b536756b96a610671209a3&oe=58EB059E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15284137_1869638396599162_3604192822861659861_n.jpg?oh=da21bdc18ac809129b9b79a2711264cf&oe=58E4D18B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1869638396599162&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-07T16:37:05+0000	1481128625	2016-12-07 17:37:05	2	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	0	0	2	1	0	2	0	0	0

You used to stock Quorn  Chefs selection Roast Beef Roast. I used to buy several at a time as my daughter loves them  but you stopped doing it  I have made contact with Quorn  who still make it  and suggested I make a product request with you. Also its the same with Quorn  Chefs Selection Beef Steaks. Please advise. There has been a thread running on Quorns Facebook page  and there are loads and loads of people who miss this product. Many thanks  look forward to hearing from you.					2016-12-07T15:48:08+0000	1481125688	2016-12-07 16:48:08	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

In this day and age I feel as a society we are so quick to complain and do not congratulate or thank good service. I just wanted to say thank you for the great customer service I have just received. Yesterday morning at 8.15 I rang customer service as I had an issue with a pair of school shoes. This issue was resolved instantly with a refund being issue. Later that day around 4.15 I ordered a new pair online  I have the delivery saver pass so chose to have them delivered today. This morning at 8.20 I had a knock at my door.....school shoes delivered. So in 24 hours I had my issue resolved  new shoes ordered and delivered! Amazing service from tesco  so thank you!

But can you please train your delivery guys one thing: When a customer already notices you having trouble driving UP the driveway  having to back up multiple times  it is not beneath your honor to accept their offer to guide you out when you have to REVERSE ALL THE WAY DOWN the driveway?  I love fun and games  and just like any other working person I appreciate a little treasure hunt before my breakfast  so I didn t mind that part. But when I found my bin 200m away in a different driveway  with it s wheels slightly rearranged and its contents neatly spread out  the joy of finding my belongings soon got replaced with the realisation that I ll have to clean that up.  There are things in everyday garbage that  once put in the bin  should stay in the bin. You do not want to have to pick them up again with your bare hands and put them back into a bin. I learned that today.  Also  you owe us a new bin. Greenstar says 30 quid.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q87/s130x130/15380519_10211540150439552_4342592374743091741_n.jpg?oh=e960c45b0520cfd38dbf88c579eba551&oe=591DB8FC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q87/p180x540/15380519_10211540150439552_4342592374743091741_n.jpg?oh=99b99d787c0d7de833919743c3723fca&oe=58E73B88	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211540150439552&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-07T11:51:47+0000	1481111507	2016-12-07 12:51:47	4	4	4	0	8	4	3	1	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I order my shopping online  pay with this card and then before my shopping is delivered I get a call asking for the security number. Apparently this is a software fault. It s time someone got cracking to sort it out. My shopping money is paid into my clubcard account each month but I can easily cancel that and go with Sainsbury offering me 58% off of my shopping or Waitrose  a similar discount. This appears not to affect ALL clubcard customers but certainly a lot more than just me. It d be interesting to know how many? I ve spoken to Tesco bank and they ve confirmed my card is alright. So  what is going on. Come on Tesco s get this sorted!					2016-12-07T10:46:49+0000	1481107609	2016-12-07 11:46:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

With 7 children and me working the night-shift it s a logistical nightmare for us to go to the store. It s for this reason that we us the Tesco Grocery iPhone app.  It turns out that our Tesco app reverted to our obsolete card details and as such our payment was declined.  Instead of passing it off and refusing to deliver  our regular delivery driver Graham (Tesco Extra Bletchley) spotted our address and came early with the online customer service rep on the phone so that we could process the payment again and not miss our delivery.  Thank you so much Graham for going out of your way.

They close at midnight and I got there at 11:40. I get there and they have turned the door off so I stand there and a security guard comes to the door and opens it.   Me: Don t you guys close at midnight?  Security guard: Yeah its midnight now.  Me: No it isn t! It s not midnight for another 20 minutes.  Security guard:(waves his hand and me in a dismissive manner) and says  yea yea yea.  This is the second time I have gone to this location and encountered RUDE staff and the second time I have found them locking up early. I complained about this before and they called the store manager...who denied that they had closed early.  Do you want customers  money or not? It seems to me that this particular store has no interest whatsoever in making any money. All they care about is going home at 12 on the dot.

From a loyal customer who shops with you on a regular basis and who has always recommend you as the best place to do online groceries  I have to say I am appalled with you today!!  So order was due tonight as usual... last week the gentleman who was delivering was such a lovely man may I add. Well tonight I am waiting up.. as we had received a text message to advise us that our delivery was delayed... ok no problem  my daughters on a school trip tomorrow so have to sort her packed lunch after delivery... but again not a problem.. after waiting till 10.55  we decided to contact you.   So apparently there was a problem with payment? No Tesco  card is correct  funds are there.... next problem.. they tried to contact you... no Tesco one missed call on the stated number all day and that was from a mobile number... not you! So you emailed which I only saw as you stated about it... so now I have waiting around all evening for you to deliver groceries which are needed to make a packed lunch for my daughters trip... and what do I have.. nothing! NO you did not call and I d probably say this was a mistake from your end  and I have been fobbed off with an excuse. If there was a genuine problem  and contact HAD been made  the problem would have been resolved. To top it off the man who answered the call was like some robot reading off a script! So after Christmas it will be time to look for somebody else to use!					2016-12-06T23:46:06+0000	1481067966	2016-12-07 00:46:06	0	18	0	0	18	18	6	12	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I sat down this morning with my usual bowl of Nestl√© Cheerios  and much to my amazement and displeasure  I could not spell my name! No amount of Frankenstein-like butchering to the circular multigrain pieces could even recreate anything close to how my name is written. So therefore I had to spend my day feeling miserable  knowing that my name could never ever be made out of cereal. I also contemplated using different types of cereal  like Rice Krispies  Corn Flakes and Nesquik. But then I came to the realisation that these cereals aren t even in the shape of letters!  Please can you recommend an appropriate cereal which could fulfil the desire to spell my name out in breakfast cereal for all to see. I can then begin to pass this story down from generation to generation for years to come.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Yours sincerely					2016-12-06T22:43:43+0000	1481064223	2016-12-06 23:43:43	24	0	41	0	41	0	0	0	0	0	24	2	1	14	0	0	0

I found a Cadbury cake in the reduced fridge section. No yellow sticker! Dam somebody must have discarded it but wait a minute  its got todays date. Bargain  somebody missed it when putting stickers on. Found a member of staff who took me to another and asked them to give me a reduced stick.  Oh yeah  i put it in the fridge but can t mark it down until 7pm  What? Everything else has a yellow sticker on but this cannot have a sticker until 7pm? Tesco  do you have some sort of special rules for cake? I left it with them as i certainly wasnt paying full price (although i had no idea what that was) for a cake going off. Nor was i going to loiter for 30 mimutes to reach 7pm for a yellow sticker (didnt look that nice). Would you be so kind as to explain why I was told this? I just cannot see the sense.					2016-12-06T21:29:22+0000	1481059762	2016-12-06 22:29:22	0	4	4	0	8	4	3	1	3	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	0

I wanted a simple sleeveless vest  but there were none on display  not a single one.  I could not find anyone to help so I went to the Customer Service Desk  and asked to speak to a manager.  I couldn t believe it when they told me they could not summon a manager becuase someone had taken their phone!  They told me to go back upstairs to the payment desk and push in to ask for the manager!  I eventually got the manager and he put me on to a member of staff  who then confirmed that they didn t have any vests. When I asked why I was told they were very short of staff.   By then the manager had already disappeared so I gave up wasting my valuable time.  I normally shop in Sainsbury  at Walton  and the service there is always first rate. Shame on Tescos today.					2016-12-06T21:22:19+0000	1481059339	2016-12-06 22:22:19	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I then returned the item in store as it wasn t what I wanted.  The staff told me I couldn t get a refund in store and it would go into my bank within 3 working days. I d also get a receipt of the return by email  I didn t get that either.  üò°  It is now December. After returning to the store and many phone calls to customer care and giving over my bank details to receive my refund. No funds have gone in my bank.  I have spoken to the supplier of the electrical item who informed me I should of got a refund the day I returned the item in store.  Why is it so hard for me to get my money back?

I  have always been a huge huge consumer of this ( I go through around 4-6 pints a day) and always favoured this over Nesquik which I found to be a bit overly sweet.  There is something odd about the way it behaves now when first spooned in to the milk  then when stirred it feels like the milk is thick and gloopy but it isnt but all this pales in to insignificance compared to whatever it is you have done to the taste!  Your mix used to taste creamy with just the right non over powering genuine flavour of banana  but now it tastes a bit gritty and the banana flavouring is now just horribly synthetic and leaves a nasty after taste.  Why did you fiddle about with it?  If its not broke dont fix it!  I am afraid I will now be going back to Nesquik as  as much as I have tried  I just do not like your  new improved  version.  Gutted üòû  The new plastic tub is an improvement though I am sure you have again reduced the amount of product like you did last time when you switched from the original plastic container to that nasty carboard carton (you think we dont notice but we do!) unfortunately I threw out the last cardboard carton so cannot compare content weights but suspect a change of package was an opportunity to reduce it					2016-12-06T20:57:09+0000	1481057829	2016-12-06 21:57:09	3	2	3	1	6	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve gone straight back to the store I picked it up from but if I hadn t noticed that soon someone could have been without what looks like Christmas presents  which isn t an ideal situation for anyone to find themselves in this Christmas period.

I for one honestly don t see the reason to order it until the 14th and collect between 20-24th raw and having to cook it at home anyway  when you can go to the store and shop exactly the same thing as you want it as much as you want whenever you want. I think it would benefit Tesco doing this  or contracting a caterer to do this for you. Or if anyone knows of anything similar please let me know.

I telephoned the store tonight as I wanted it for a gift!

I and my wife actually like a certain Ros e wine purple label a Tesco Spanish wine..........i also recommended this wine to friends i know and our local Tesco keeps running out of it.  This wine was really well priced at only ¬£3.00 per bottle and at 11% was a very nice wine and as i say being very well priced  So.........why did they reduce the strength by half% and slightly change the label..............OK we could live with that but then about a month or so ago the price went up by 15 pence a 5% increase and not satisfied with this increase they thought lets put it up another 35 pence another 12%...............do you think customers are stupid?. I have shopped in Tesco as long as i can remember but i am not going to be made a fool of........recently i have been shopping in Bargain Stores..........like Home Bargains and B and M and the price difference on some of the items is astounding..take just a couple of items........Kellogg s variety pack...Home Bargains and B and M......normal price ¬£1....Tesco normal price ¬£2 but on special this week at 50% off ...¬£1....conning the customer thinking they have a massive bargain. Pot Noodle  ¬£1 in Tesco....Home Bargains and B and M normal price just 69 pence....Maris Piper potatoes worked out at exactly twice the price by weight at Tesco as they do at Home Bargains. Cheese...hams....all cheaper...I could go into Home bargains and buy just one pack of Kellogg s variety and go into Tesco and would have to buy ¬£100 worth of shopping to save the same amount of money..... ¬£1 and i would have to wait for that in the form of a voucher to present at my next Tesco shop and....if i was to buy a Kellogg s variety pack at the normal price of ¬£2....have i saved?......i don t think so!!					2016-12-06T17:44:22+0000	1481046262	2016-12-06 18:44:22	1	28	1	0	29	28	6	22	40	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I clicked and collected on Sunday (4th) to find today that the  free from  CHILDRENS YOGHURTS you had given me went out of date on Friday (2nd) the packaging on the outside doesn t have the date on and only one yoghurt on the inside has the date which is hard to see as it is black writing in a dark purple lid.   I fed these to my 6 month old lactose free baby without even checking the date as I wasn t expecting to be delivered out of date food. I am disgusted and feel sick that my tiny newly weaned baby has been fed out of date food.   My child already suffers with stomach problems and this could have made him so much worse!   I suggest you check the shelves in your Shoreham store as the yogurts will need to be removed from the cardboard packaging to see if they are out of date. This isn t the first time I have been in the store and seen out of date food on the shelf 2 weeks ago your fruit pots were all out of date!   Train your staff before people start getting sick!					2016-12-06T17:05:32+0000	1481043932	2016-12-06 18:05:32	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday (Monday 5th December) I needed to get some fuel. 99%  of the time I go to Morrison for my fuel except on the rare occasion I run too low and attend the first fuel station available. Yesterday appeared to be that day and even with a vallaint effort to get to Morrison I found myself having to stop sooner at Tesco s  it wasn t a big issue or so I thought! It was busy  all the pumps were full and small queue s at each pump  in for a penny in for a pound join a queue any queue watching all the other vehicles around me I joined a queue. I got to the pump and there was a red sticker saying something about remote assistance for disabled drivers  there was no information on how to use or access the service and couldn t find any speakers or buttons and the queue is building up behind me so I positioned my car far enough out to have the additional space to get my chair out. Got out the car  used the car for balance and got the chair out the rear or the car  got seated and positioned  pick up the nosle and put it into my car. The screen says pay at the pump only. So I had to put the nosle back put my chair back into the car get myself back into the car  by this point the car in front is moving off  brilliant that will do nicely  pulled forward ready to get back out looked at the screen  pay at the pump only. I then had to drive all the out of the petrol station round the roundabout and back in rejoining the evergrowing queue which now also involved a police car 6 civilian cars and a hgv that couldn t decide where to go. Eventually after 5 mins I got myself into another queue at another pump. Here we go again.  pulled up with still no instructions on how to access disabled help  I got out the car leaving enough space to get my chair out  struggled to the rear of the car got my chair out and started to fill up. Once done I entered the shop to pay by cash. I was the only one in the shop as the last customer left as I was approaching. failing to find any push button pads to automatically open the door for me i struggled with the door until customer leaving came to help. once inside the shop there was 3 cashiers in the shop one serving the lady who helped me with the door one in the office with the door open so i could see her and one sitting watching me struggle. Brilliant isnt it. I waited for about 40-50secs to be called and served while the two counter cashiers finished thier chit chat about that nights dinner plans. The cashier didnt even call me she just stood there looking at me at which point i looked at her and her colleague and asked if they had finished sorting thier dinner arrangements. There was no response so i went over and ask why the pay at the pump only pumps were not marked as such or were they temporarily not accepting cash if not why is there no sign noticable to the customers. After about a 2-3 min discussion on which pumps they were the cashier in the office got up and joined the conversation  by which point other customers were coming in to pay. The other cashier at the till had no interest in serving the customers waiting she stood and listened into the conversation i was having with my cashier and office lady. The queueing customers were starting to get a bit restless at not being served. once we assertained which pumps i was referring to she oh there are signs up and should be on all four of those pumps as they are all pay at the pump only. then office lady says oh the two rear ones are sign posted GET THIS! JUST UNDER THE ROOF  because thats exactly where all motorists look for a sign when they are watching traffic and other vehicles straight ahead of them. and those signs only cover the two rear pumps not the front two but i am supposed to know that the signs out of my line of vision under the roof are for all four pumps. I explained to the cashier that the signs need to be more prominant and explain which pumps they refer to. Not a single word out the cashier  she took my money  and gave me a receipt. No thank you  no apology  no explanation nothing  not even a single word to say we offer disabled assistance and this is how you could access the service. that would have been my next question had she not have been so ignorant. by which point i just gave up and didnt even bother. resulting to the fact i would rather pay through the nose at texaco than use Tesco s again. Once i paid and went to leave the shop that was another challenge in itself. Granted its not a big shop. Its wide enough for shelves against the wall with a single que of people then a center isle of shelves with another que of people then shelving against the other wall. When people come into the shop they dont form queue s either side of the center shelving its not big enough and people wont get out out. so you come in form a single queue approach the counter pay and leave by the other side of the shelving. It keeps things flowing as its not possible to try and get back through the queue of people to get out. Bloody brilliant idea in principle. paid for my fuel managed to turn around to try and get out. on the left against the wall is a massive hot drinks station which wouldnt have posed a problem had the staff not stuck 4 large  heavy boxes on the floor right opposite the drinks station that sticks out a little too far. i tried to shift them out the way to the side so i had enough space to get my chair through  but i got stuck  so when i eventually got myself free and turned around the cashier that served me is standing watching me  not at any point did she offer to come and help or shift the boxes over a bit  and office lady was back in her office but still she didnt shout someone to assist me like office lady if the cashier was still serving. The whole shop of queing people then had to move to the side and out of the way so i could get through with my chair  all because someone thought they would stack some boxes right opposite an object that protruded into the ailse thus shortening the space for me to get my chair through. well done  very well thought out. Brilliant idea  it was wide enough for an able bodied person to walk past so thats ok  that will be fine no problem leaving boxes stacked up narrowing the gap as long as someone can walk past it. well done ü§£üëçüëåüëè.As most of the customers had to move to let me back out the way i came in some waited outside the shop or by the door so the door was already open and at least i didnt have to struggle with it on they way out. Excellent service  top class. truly a customer focused company! And that ladies and gentleman since my ex husband transfered out of that tesco store and back to scotland in 09 is why i never use tesco s.					2016-12-06T16:07:30+0000	1481040450	2016-12-06 17:07:30	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately  you have failed to effectively deal with the issues you created in private  so I am going to have to address this in the public domain.  Your incompetency meant that we made hundreds of pounds of losses at a charity event I ran the bar for  and rather than offering compensation  you gave me a ¬£20 e coupon voucher! Presumably  you do not understand that I will never be using your services again  rendering this  kind gesture  useless.  You are a rich company stealing from the people.

Purchased on 1st November it arrived a few days later. When i tried to use it  it showed that no money had been loaded and it hadn t been activated even though it was bought from tesco and paid for online. Around 8 -10 phone calls over the following month led to nothing. Firstly promised it would be looked into. Then promised it would be manually loaded. Then when that didn t happen  a new card would be sent out. that was weeks ago. When i called this week the paperwork was still sitting on someones desk. three more calls until i finally spoke to a lovely woman who hopefully has sorted it. Going down to the office herself i am now today told it has been posted. No real official apology only one from the poor woman on the helpline.

There are so many products close to or on the day of the use by date and I find that on most of my weekly shops  I pick up something that is out of date. I expect to be able to buy a resonable amount of food that will last until later in the week. I now find that I have to spend a good chunk of my time in your store checking dates and swapping items.  Today I wasn t as thorough as I thought as whilst i was putting my items away I noticed the date on some sausages were yesterday s date. Is just not good enough. I haven t got time to return them and why should I waste even more of my day doing so?  I m a regular shopper at tesco and I would typically spend between ¬£60-¬£100 in your stores weekly. I m seriously considering spending that money somewhere else.  Happy to send a photo of the product and the receipt but reluctant to put my receipt photo on here. Awaiting a response  Claire.					2016-12-06T11:57:30+0000	1481025450	2016-12-06 12:57:30	6	9	8	0	17	9	8	1	3	0	6	0	0	0	0	2	0

Where she had her second operation to put her hip back in her joint after suffering from hip dysplasia possibly since birth. Yesterday we were delivered a present which was a wooden farm puzzle donated by Tesco. Which is fantastic. But today I m totally overwhelmed as we were given another present which is a toot toot animals safari park. I m so over whelmed by your company s generosity that me and Rosie just wanted to say thank you so much. Safe to says she s enjoying the paper at the moment. But seeing as this was something on her Christmas list to Father Christmas we are safe to say so greatful. Thank you tesco!!!

And for some weird reason it decided to put it to and old address but i did not realise till i had paid. So i looked in the help and it states phone customer services to change address if you need it done after paying or something like that unfortunately by that point it was 11:01 so i had to wait till this morning  and so the fun began after initially getting through and then being hung up on after 20 seconds of silence from tescos end i tried again  and got through. The bloke i spoke to could not seem to work the system he asked my name which i gave then asked for my email which i gave then said so is your name Robinson or Ramases whuch is the first part of my email  did he not understandhis own questions?. Then he informed my he had cancelled my order as it could not be comuted across????? So why state on the app to call customer services to change address if you cant... i would have just left it as it was and gone to my old address as my ex and my kid still live there and collected it as its only 10 mins away.					2016-12-06T09:21:52+0000	1481016112	2016-12-06 10:21:52	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

But now you ve taken it one step too far and made Tesco own brand milkshake powders sugar free!! And what s with getting rid of the chocolate flavour?? Not everyone likes strawberry and banana! And even with many customers complaining you still go on to make these changes!   Many people are allergic to the ingredients in sugar free alternatives and it tastes vulgar so why should you take that right away from people? It s not about making healthy choices because you ve just taken that from everyone who shops with you guys. However I m sure you know all of this!   Also not everyone can get to other stores to get alternate products that aren t sugar free so online shopping is the only way  again another right taken away from people. Suppose we could just change our online shop to Asda who sell a wider variety of products with sugar!   I m sure you are losing customers! Sort it out please! some of us only have a Tesco near so the issue of convenience comes up as not everyone has time to shop around in multiple stores!  Bring back full sugar drinks!					2016-12-06T04:21:52+0000	1480998112	2016-12-06 05:21:52	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I suggest that to save other families facing this situation  you may want to add a few more pieces of steak to your pies!  I have provided photos of our gravy (steak free) pie for your reference.

Off to the shop  we did go  Inside  Christmas songs did flow. To the decoration aisle we ran  Tinsel - lots of - this was the plan.  But no. Not there. No tinsel in sight. Mum asked an assistant about the tinsel plight.  Alas  he said  no tinsel here   How can that be?!  They cried  where is the festive cheer?!   The family left  no tinsel in tow  Just some plastic beads and a shabby bow. And now  the Christmas tree looks bare.

Had to walk  straight out as the Christmas music was on so loud it was deafening. I asked a member of staff if he could turn it down-he said he wasn t allowed to  however  that most staff wanted it off also. It is a health and safety issue to have music blaring like this-it is also extremely unpleasant for customers. I always do my shopping in Tesco bit will be boycotting it and going to Waitrose round the corner where they have a mature and professional attitude and listen to this kind of feedback. Friends are also boycotting Tesco for the same reason.					2016-12-05T19:57:21+0000	1480967841	2016-12-05 20:57:21	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was about to pay and boom  a power cut. It came back on just as quickly  but the result was lots of beeping and bewildered tills  customers and staff. However  the duty mangaer type person was quick into action. Directing staff and customers. The main tills were still a bit unsure on what to do with themselves  but the self serve ones seemed to have bounced back. The manager said I d have to scan my shopping again. As an apology for the inconvenience I could have my tin of roses  humongous bag of pasta and the screen wash (which is all I  actually went in for!) for free. A staff member did all the scanning and packing and continuously apologised. Which was lovely considering it was a power cut and not exactly Tescos fault. So from someone who has complained numerous times to Tesco in the past  it is nice to be passing on a compliment to you and the staff team in Sealand Rd.  And thank you for the chocs  which I can now eat (and not gift) as they were freeeeee!!!					2016-12-05T18:59:39+0000	1480964379	2016-12-05 19:59:39	3	4	3	0	7	4	3	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Did you also know that they are currently Number 2 in the classical charts and making their way up the main charts.  Lincolnshire - locally known as RAF Lincolnshire is home to 5 choirs - 4 of which sang on the album.  Sleaford branch is the nearest Tesco to 2/3 of these choirs and there s not a single copy for sale on the shelves.  A group of us ended up travelling into Lincoln itself to HMV where our album was played and we sang along in store with our album at the entrance and riding number 2 in their trending charts.  Come on Tesco - get behind your local community and get the album on the shelves please!					2016-12-05T18:53:42+0000	1480964022	2016-12-05 19:53:42	21	12	21	1	34	12	2	10	11	0	21	0	0	0	0	0	0

Then after arrangements had been made  Tesco changed their mind a few hours later.  - Offered a refund but was told TV would not be replaced. No offer of a repair (even though it s a brand new TV). Would not say why at first  then told it was out of stock. Consumer rights act 2015  states if a product is not fit for purpose then a replacement or repair  at the expense of the company who sold the product  must be offered.   - A few hours later  after further trying to resolve the problem with Tesco  they told me Tesco had discontinued selling the TV product (05/12/16).  - TV was still available to buy (now at an increased price at which I paid  ¬£399) on the Tesco website. (After being told it was discontinued). Even though I was told it was out of stock (05/12/16) and then told it was discontinued  I was able to place an order for the exact same model TV as a new customer with no problems. Videos/screenshots taken as proof with times and date. (Had previously asked  after being told it was out of stock  for a change to be made to website to show it was out of stock)  over 5 hours later  no change had been made.  - Furniture ombudsman contacted after trying to resolve the matter with Tesco failed.  - Trading standards to be notified  along with a letter and message to Tescos  CEO  containing the full transcript of conversation.  Extremely disappointed with Tesco that we could not come to an agreement and that this matter had to be taken further. Will provide constant daily feedback updates via Facebook and twitter social media to help any other people in a similar situation.					2016-12-05T18:14:59+0000	1480961699	2016-12-05 19:14:59	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

To my amazement  minutes later  the prawns are glowing brightly at the bottom of the bin.

Not only can you not even spell  Tesco  (how hard can it BE?) but ON the box it says  suitable for indoor and outdoor  and IN the box it says  indoor only . I go in Tesco very rarely and this is what happens. 0/10 - go to the bottom of the class.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15338706_10154680766413529_7541674546569597939_n.jpg?oh=092ff4a7b5441bd15c3234333c482360&oe=58E5C015	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15338706_10154680766413529_7541674546569597939_n.jpg?oh=928882489fce32e4e2d9e04e79841c0d&oe=591B6F18	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154680766413529&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-05T17:25:45+0000	1480958745	2016-12-05 18:25:45	0	7	2	0	9	7	3	4	3	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

We bought a bike for our son s Christmas present in September. We got the bike and put it in the loft  upon attempting to set it up last night we discovered the chain guard and the stabilisers are shattered. The bike is now out of stock on your website and your only options are that you collect the bike  we pay for a new one and then we get the refund within 5 working days. I don t have the money to pay for a present I have already bought  it s the second week of December. Or that we wait for the refund but you can t guarantee that the bike is in stock. All we asked for is that you send a replacement as you pick up the broken bike  and that we get the refund for the difference.I am tears  I worked very hard to buy my son a present to find it broken  and then find you no help at all. This is not the first issue we ve had with broken Tesco direct items and we have always been patient. I ve cancelled our weekly shop with you  and I m afraid if we don t get a satisfactory response we ll take all of our custom elsewhere- as a 4 year old boy who wrote to Father Christmas asking for a monster bike currently isn t getting one  and you really don t seem to care.					2016-12-05T17:08:17+0000	1480957697	2016-12-05 18:08:17	3	27	10	7	44	26	20	6	25	0	3	0	0	0	0	6	0

Ordered click and collect this morning (would have been delivery had there been ANY available slots) go to pick my shopping up in the earliest slot 4pm-6pm and find that there are substitutes.... ok so some substitutes to be expected  Rubens apples to Braeburn apples  yellow pepper to orange pepper and velvet toilet roll to Tesco own. Apples fine. Peppers fine but toilet roll quality is absolutely not the same.  Further down we have 12 bottles of water. Just water. Nothing special about it. Just plain old water.  No appropriate substitute available.  So now this evening after my children have been to school I have to drag a new born  a stroppy 12 year old and a 7 year old boy who does not cope well with supermarkets around to go and buy 12 bottles of water and apples for the lunch boxes tomorrow and yellow pepper for tea as well as toilet roll which as you know is kind of a necessity.   This defeats the point of online shopping. If I wanted to go into a supermarket I would have done so in the first place. I declined all substitutions being as the most important thing I needed was the water and no substitutions were made because apparently Tesco only sell one type of water.  Made a complaint to find a solution to the problem and have been told there is no solution.  Great service Tesco  first and last time I ll be shopping with yourselves. If you wanted to keep customers and give great service I d have a 12 pack of water on my door step before the day was out.					2016-12-05T17:03:40+0000	1480957420	2016-12-05 18:03:40	2	6	2	0	8	6	5	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been in contact with your support team recently regarding my daughters hudl that we bought as a Christmas present back in 2013.. we had lots of issues with it  and 2015 it was sent away and a new HUDL was given to us (after a choice of refund or exchange). We went on this option based on the fact Santa had given it to her and she was very upset she could no longer use the item!! After a little wait we had the HUDL back but again pretty useless- it will not charge or even turn on for her anymore...  I ve been going through the process of contacting Tesco support regarding this  when being told they would call me back it hasn t happened and leaves me having to call you again. Today it has been said after finally finding my proof of purchase that I will not be given any kind of refund or exchange as it was so long ago  despite the two facts that we had opted to have an exchange previously and the fact it s happened all over again! As a loyal customer of Tesco I m very disheartened that nothing more has been done to help us in regard to this. Tesco tiverton tech team had told me as there was so many problems with the Hudls they were discontinued and I would get a refund or exchange as the item is deemed unsafe!					2016-12-05T16:58:12+0000	1480957092	2016-12-05 17:58:12	1	8	1	0	9	8	3	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This was apparently due to a system error of Wellingborough store being unable to upload everyone s orders for picking. These things happen but I am furious that no one bothered to have the common courtesy to telephone or even text me to explain the situation. I now have to wait until tomorrow afternoon for a new delivery. I have 5 children and I do not drive so anything needed for today and tomorrow has now had to be purchased in our local grocery store which is considerably dearer than Tesco. There is also no consistency over goodwill gestures. I was offered a ¬£10 ecoupon then discovered my friend  who s order was due the same time  got that plus another ¬£4 for the missed delivery slot. Shocking customer service for such a large company.					2016-12-05T16:43:00+0000	1480956180	2016-12-05 17:43:00	1	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

I really love your sweet easy peeler clementines however they should not be called easy peelers. They are incredibly difficult to peel. I brought two of them to work with me today (trying to stay healthy) and I now have more peel under my finger nails than I do in the bin. I have given up trying to peel the second one and opted for a chocolate biscuit instead thereby defeating the object of my healthy clementine snack.  You should really rename them  challenging peelers  !					2016-12-05T15:31:09+0000	1480951869	2016-12-05 16:31:09	6	7	9	0	16	6	6	0	2	0	6	0	0	3	0	0	0

I have just taken delivery of my weekly shop and I just wanted to let you know of an incredibly useless substitution that was sent. I ordered a box of Cow and Gate baby milk  apparently this was out of stock (which I find hard to believe) so 4 small bottles of ready made formula were sent. This isnt even a days worth of milk for my baby? This now means I have to go out and get it  which entirely defeats the object of getting a home delivery? I can only imagine the person who picked it neither has a baby or has ever been shopping with one!!!					2016-12-05T14:17:31+0000	1480947451	2016-12-05 15:17:31	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Today my postage stamps were missing and I had a pack of cherry tomatoes that needed to be used by tomorrow....(i would be sick...lol) The short shelf life was not at the top of the invoice so I didn t have the opportunity of returning them to the driver.  NOW....what I want to actually say is WELL DONE Tesco.....no matter what my complaints are they are always dealt with quickly and efficiently. The customer services is brilliant. Everyone makes mistakes  especially at this time of the year and I really didn t like complaining. However I received immediate refunds and even a phone call from the relevant store. I wish all businesses could be as efficient as Tesco.....10 out of 10...and thank you for all the brilliant work that you and your staff to do make my shopping experience 99% trouble free.

I visited your MK Kingston store on Thursday evening (1st Dec) and bought various items  amongst which was Cow & Gate pre-made formula for my baby son. This was purchased as my partner and I were spending our first night away together since our son was born 8 months ago and so he was staying with his Aunty. Pre-made formula seemed like the easiest option as my sister would have 3 children under 2 years old to care for.  I purchased 8 bottles  6 of which I sent with my son to my sisters house for his sleepover on Friday and 2 were kept at home.   On Sunday 4th December my partner took our son out for the afternoon and took said pre-made formula with him. As he was going to open the bottle to dispense into our sons bottle he noticed the expiry date was 29.7.16  over 4 MONTHS OUT OF DATE. Their afternoon was then cut short as they had to return home to feed the baby.   I then contacted my sister as I had left a couple of bottles with her for her son who is 5 months old. When she checked  these bottles were also out of date by 4 months. She then also raided her recycling to check the dates on the bottles fed to my son  these were found to also be 4 months out of date!   How can this happen? How is there baby products 4 MONTHS out of date on your shelves? As a busy mum I don t have time to check all the dates on products I buy  particularly on these items that should have long shelf lives. I have to trust that the store is being responsible and rotating/checking stock.    I am so upset! My son is poorly at the moment anyway with a horrid cold but the thought of making him more ill and causing him discomfort by feeding him this out of date milk is very distressing.  Thankfully my sister had not fed my nephew any of this milk before we noticed so at least we spared him.   I dread to think what would have happened if my son was younger and hope any other parents have not fed this milk to their newborns as it could cause serious illness in these vulnerable babies.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15337518_10154985442767150_344619256650507097_n.jpg?oh=6544285f0df7895b2b32929da993256a&oe=58DF0582	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15337518_10154985442767150_344619256650507097_n.jpg?oh=b05cb6f2aebd543effd26bf168984ad0&oe=59212D97	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154985442767150&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-05T11:49:53+0000	1480938593	2016-12-05 12:49:53	0	50	12	54	116	39	12	27	21	0	0	0	5	0	0	7	0

This will save you paying for it to be taken away to landfill and is a more organic way for the waste. I have previously contacted DEFRA and they have no objection to this as the veg is stored away from meat in supermarkets.

Each time I have had to contact them a week or two later to ask them what happened to my refund. It s a waste of my time and I resent the fact that Tesco keeps customers  money until they ask for it. I am meticulous about recording my finances  so I wonder how many tens of thousands of pounds of customers  money Tesco is keeping for people who do not record or check their finances as regularly. By the way  it is the GREENFORD store/warehouse that delivers my groceries. This is in addition to generally poor customer service  including drivers being rude  failing to find my address  even though it is a cul de sac with only 5 houses or simply not turning up at all. I have continued shopping with Tesco simply because I can usually get everything I want there  which is not always the case with other supermarkets  but I m afraid that the poor customer service is losing out to the likes of Morrisons and Ocado who (so far) have provided impeccable customer service. You need to up your game Tesco if you don t want to lose even more customers. It s not enough to rely on customers contacting you to put things right - you need to find out why they are going wrong in the first place and stop them happening. I m sure I m not the only customer who is tired of having to phone you every time I place an order.

When I shopped in store I would always add some extra bits to my trolley to put into the local food bank collection at the front of the store but since shopping online it hasn t happened which is unfortunate but it s currently hard for me to get to any shops. Would you be able to consider adding such an option to your website?					2016-12-04T21:26:39+0000	1480886799	2016-12-04 22:26:39	5	3	5	0	8	3	2	1	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

You have moved any reduced items to one area and I really think you need revert this and go back to the previous arrangement of one reduced section in fruit & veg  one in meat etc. Unfortunately you cannot trust some your customers to act responsibly and today we saw two scuffles. One which involved lots of shouting  we were quite far away at the time and the entire store was filled with the noise.   The second incident happened when we were very near the reduced section when we witnessed five adult women push a child out of the way to get the newly put out reduced food. Not only did they shove a child and each other about but when they had retreated to block the aisle opposite and wait for the next lot of reduced items the left food all over the floor.   It s not safe for passers by  or your staff and it results in people blocking other shoppers movements. If you choose to keep it as it is you would need staff to ensure that behaviour does not continue to be honest I don t think you could pay your staff enough to deal with that!					2016-12-04T20:59:58+0000	1480885198	2016-12-04 21:59:58	6	9	6	1	16	9	3	6	5	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is the product of much suffering and i refuse to wear anything with it in. The label was not clear at all  in fact i had to remove it once home to see clearly that it did in fact contain down. On investigation it appears most of your coats in fact contain down  or faux fur which does not always mean fake fur. Needless to say the jacket was returned and i told them why. Please think about the consequences of your stocking such products. If you don t understand or know this  i can provide plenty of evidence to show you that it entails horrific cruelty and suffering to animals . If you do already know this  then the question is why ?					2016-12-04T18:32:40+0000	1480876360	2016-12-04 19:32:40	4	4	4	0	8	4	1	3	7	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

When she had finished serving me she handed me a box of chocolates to apologise for the wait and for making the mistake. This is the nicest thing someone in retail has ever done! I hardly waited a long time and wasn t in any rush. I couldn t see a name badge but she was on the cigarette counter in princes risborough  she had long blonde hair and a grey christmas jumper on it was about 1-1.30 today.

This happened in November and again only yesterday. This time I decided to visit the Roborough branch in Plymouth  and both their toy aisles were adorned end to end with signs advertising the 3 for 2 offer but alas all the Pokemon toys were sold. I spoke to the Customer Services department who were really obliging and tried to hunt out an extra tin for me after showing both my receipts but alas to no avail. For some reason your Lee Mill branch is not advertising this sale at all. After my previous visit to that store back in November I actually stood in that aisle with a member of staff who insisted the toys were no longer on promotion but on my phone I was able to see they were still on 3 for 2 on your Tesco Direct site. So currently I have spent ¬£26 on 2 tins back in November when I could have had a third and again the same yesterday. I am wondering how many other customers are buying toys unaware that there is an offer so they are unwittingly buying two items and not receiving the third free item.....

Although my local Tesco (tiverton  Devon) said they constantly had 3 in stock when I asked your members of staff no one could locate them and they only reappeared once they went back up to ¬£75.... many thanks x	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15356607_10158071726465495_3942145882447280436_n.jpg?oh=31f36cdc16e809dbbea746a386a453b5&oe=591F3C02	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15356607_10158071726465495_3942145882447280436_n.jpg?oh=860b6ebdebde2f4ef5418be018a6bc14&oe=58D9F10F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158071726465495&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-04T16:55:32+0000	1480870532	2016-12-04 17:55:32	1	14	1	0	15	12	6	6	11	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My family buys Tesco s Free From Vegetable Gravy Granules  as I m a vegetarian with Coeliac disease. We were running low and grabbed a new tub while we were in store a few weeks back  which I ve used once or twice since then (as it was at the front of the cupboard). It has a red lid (the same as the Beef tubs)  but as the tub is labelled Vegetable Gravy and the foil was sealed  we figured someone had just been messing about and switched the lids or something.  A few days ago  I used the last couple of spoons from the old tub (green lid)  then went to top it up with some from the new tub (red lid). That s when I noticed that they are quite clearly different - the granules from the new tub are darker in colour and smell different (my meat-eating dad said that the new gravy definitely smells beefy to him  rather than the vegetabley smell of the other gravy). At first I hoped that the recipe had been changed  but I can find nothing about a recipe change anywhere  and the ingredient lists on both tubs are identical. Which leads me to think that there has been a manufacturing mix-up  and this tub is mislabelled  and actually contains beef - which  as a vegetarian of nearly 10 years  is honestly absolutely vile to think about.  When I was in Tesco a couple of days ago  I saw that there were many more tubs of Vegetable Gravy which had red lids  which has me worried that this may not be just a one-off mix-up  and there may be many more tubs like this. I honestly feel so sick  disgusted and horrified that I - not to mention many others - might have unintentionally eaten beef.  Can you clarify for me whether or not there has been a recipe change? I am 99% certain that that is not the case here (due to the ingredient lists being identical)  but if I m wrong here  I d like to know. If that isn t the case  you have some serious damage control to do.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15230752_10150835800249977_8550244919386463114_n.jpg?oh=4538f45cc571c617cc6f1edd70433932&oe=58ED3FB2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15230752_10150835800249977_8550244919386463114_n.jpg?oh=d82bacf0bf1e3f4e77d92da56b5963c7&oe=58DD8EBF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150835800249977&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-04T14:25:47+0000	1480861547	2016-12-04 15:25:47	3	5	5	0	10	5	4	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	2	0

Unpacking my shopping I could smell an unpleasant smell coming from one of my bags. On closer inspection of the potatoes  two had gone rotten  covering the rest of the contents in a layer of smelly slime! Several of the rest were damaged  obviously prior to packing. Half the contents are in the bin  the rest have had to be scrubbed. I don t now have time (@2.15 on Sunday) to get back to the store before it closes. This is not an acceptable standard  fortunately it s only my husband and I eating tonight and not the whole family otherwise there would not be enough to go round!!

You have added multiple fruit juices and concentrates to your recipe which leaves myself and many others with digestive problems (following the low-FODMAP diet)  unable to eat your products.   My diet is already so restricted and I am gutted to now find that one of the only brands of gluten free bread I am able to eat  are now written off.   It would be great if this could be reviewed and taken into account for when/if you alter your recipes again.

Anyway today I found out that if you order under ¬£40 of food you not only get charged ¬£4 as a  minimum basket charge   but you also have to pay the delivery charge  so today I paid ¬£9.50 for only buying ¬£30 worth of food.  I think it is disgusting to charge customers TWICE for not spending over ¬£40. It s just part of our wonderful world s way of discriminating against people who are single and live alone - sometimes I don t need ¬£40 worth of food as I don t have a husband or wife or children to feed. So please charge me ¬£9.50 for the privilege. Well I had booked my Christmas slot and already have an extensive shopping list as I will be cooking for my whole family this Christmas - it s a shame sainsburys will get the business and not you because of the appalling way you treat your regular customers.					2016-12-04T13:01:59+0000	1480856519	2016-12-04 14:01:59	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You should be ashamed Tesco that you are selling these products. Just because they carry a warning it does not make them safe. No more Tesco clothing for my baby.					2016-12-04T11:47:04+0000	1480852024	2016-12-04 12:47:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

All were cancelled despite paying regularly for the Delivery Saver.  I have emailed customer service and received multiple replies where they refuse to help just to find out that they dates I booked were still available. Then they released them for others to book. Apparently they have no control over deliveries which I find difficult to believe.  I never attempted to book a coveted Christmas Delivery.  If you are a loyal customer paying additional expense for a service because you are disabled and house bound I would have thought some effort could have been made especially when the glitch in their system wiped out multiple reservations I paid for.  Sadly this is the first grocery delivery issue but I have also been inconvenienced a few times recently by their direct delivery which should be covered under this plan.  Disability is a factor for me but more so the unwillingness to help and repeated contact I have had to make myself is time consuming and not what I expect from a store I have been loyal too and paid additional feeds for a service to ease my situation.  Is have asked to speak to someone in more Authority but due to a complete disregard to my request have now had to embarrass myself on social media hoping this receives a response.					2016-12-04T06:06:02+0000	1480831562	2016-12-04 07:06:02	1	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Based on the advertisement  while spending RM100 and above  we are entitled to get Jimat RM10 coupon as per T&C. However  during redeeming the coupons  I was told the RM10 coupons were out of stock and I can only get 3 pieces RM3 coupons as replacement. According to the manager on duty  this is the Tesco rights to change any T&C. As a consumer  I need to know what is my rights as a consumer while I following the T&C set by Tesco and I was rejected to get what I suppose to have.

We are currently in the process of potty training a rather reluctant little girl. We have to spend a fortune on  potty presents  each week. This week we ordered quite a few in our delivery. Sadly some were unavailable and there were  no suitable substitutions . Currently ALL toys are 3 for 2. We receive FIVE. Yes FIVE of the toys we ordered. Meaning  You Mr Tesco have swindled us out of a FREE toy. Surely  common sense would say  Oh  they have ordered these toys  so lets just duplicate some of those! 	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15317783_10153990858601625_6228057289015311788_n.jpg?oh=8f1105b930fbf7be5f8a61057e5785fd&oe=591903B4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15317783_10153990858601625_6228057289015311788_n.jpg?oh=84d759c18cf75a9357e260c50ef179e7&oe=591CE4B9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153990858601625&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-03T21:07:56+0000	1480799276	2016-12-03 22:07:56	2	7	2	0	9	7	1	6	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I arrived with my 2yr old twins and 4yr old to find not a single double seated trolly anywhere near the mother and child spaces   with no trolly man in sight I headed upto the customer desk  Daniel Price was quick to ask if he could help he listened to my problem and promptly left the desk to find me s trolly  he was gone a while and clearly had to spend a long time walking the cold without a coat and only his jumper to find me one he then returned with the trolly and helped put my twins in then got all 3 boys a piece of the free fruit whilst I put my bags in and he checked we were all ok and he did all this with a smile on his face too. It was lovely to see that despite the store being so busy and clearly very stressful he was able to help and be happy huge well done to Daniel from me and my boys :)					2016-12-03T21:01:24+0000	1480798884	2016-12-03 22:01:24	117	16	126	0	142	16	14	2	6	0	116	9	0	0	0	0	0

In one store the double trolleys were so jammed in with the singles that I had to walk to customer services to ask someone to come and help me (and she struggled!)  in another there wasn t any double trolleys that I could find and I gave up looking in the third and put my eldest in the compartment where the food goes - which while fun for a 2.5 year old  it s also rather dangerous!  Help the mums out Tesco and make the double trolleys token free and put them with the car seat/baby seat/baby seat&toddler seat trolleys!					2016-12-03T20:51:41+0000	1480798301	2016-12-03 21:51:41	0	6	1	0	7	6	3	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I ve just got them out and realised that  while there is nothing to say that the product is not suitable for home freezing  there is also nothing to say that it is! So I suppose my question is  is the product still safe to eat once thawed and cooked?					2016-12-03T19:39:13+0000	1480793953	2016-12-03 20:39:13	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Did my shopping and paid for it  but my daughter needed the toilet before we left. I didn t want to leave my shopping or let her go in on her own so I took the trolley in with us to the disabled toilet  as it was very quiet so I wasn t in anyone s way. As we came out there was a quiet couple of beeps  wasn t sure what it was so went to the doors. The security guard put up his hand to stop us and said we set the alarm off in the toilet. He then looked me up and down and just stared until I asked if he wanted to check the shopping. He made us wait until he put the trolley through the gates. As no alarm went off so then he let us go through before giving us the trolley back. No apology afterwards and we had a lot of people staring during this embarrassing experience. Perhaps in future a bit more delicacy in this situation wouldn t go amiss and an apology afterwards for the implication that I was a thief! I ve long been a customer of tesco but I certainly don t feel inclined to shop here again after this experience					2016-12-03T18:55:39+0000	1480791339	2016-12-03 19:55:39	0	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0

Really love your monthly brochure that comes out showing the offers and recipies  however I ve found this month s to be very disappointing :-( Absolutely fell in love with  that s the spirit  promotion in your December edition <3 However that was very short lived :-( As a keen Hendricks fan I noted the offer for the Enchanter Gift Set which includes a 70cl bottle of my favourite tipple at the amazing price of ¬£27! Great! Couldn t wait to get down to my local Tesco with my mum who was keen to spend her money on something I would enjoy as a Christmas gift. Sadly this wasn t to be :-( Not only does my local Tesco admit they haven t had any of these in store on the offer  but they are unaware of whether indeed they might ever receive any at Dunfermline Duloch :-( They cannot order it for me or indeed advise me when it might be available :-( What is the point in running a promotion when you have no intention of supplying the stock that goes with the said offer? :-( Needless to say.. I am very sad at this disaster of a  promotion . Can someone please look into this for me?? I m quite miffed about the whole thing  especially as I ve had my eye on a bottle of this for my Christmas gift for sometime (I ve been price watching between you and Asda for some time now on a weekly basis). Looking forward to hearing something from you soon and hoping it s a little more promising than your promotion.

Cashier asked for our ID  so we handed our French ID card  they got rejected: they said they only accept UK driving licences and passports!!! Some nice guy offered to buy it for us and cashier said she won t allow it  even though we re obviously over 18. Did I miss something or you now have to be a British citizen to buy alcohol? I don t think so so I d appreciate an explanation AND apology.					2016-12-03T18:20:14+0000	1480789214	2016-12-03 19:20:14	2	3	5	0	8	3	3	0	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	3	0

I had done my shopping with my 2 year old daughter who is poorly with a cough and I had an order to collect so I waited by the customer service desk to collect it. The lady there was having a conversation with another customer and could clearly see me standing there holding my daughter. I stood there waiting for 10 minutes  the lady (in a red t-shirt I didn t get her name) totally ignored me and began serving the customers at the tabbocco tills. I wondered why she was being so rude  the security person was also there and could see me waiting but no one said anything to me. Finally after almost 15 minutes she asked me if I was waiting for something  I think it was quite clear that I was. She then informed me that I had to wait in the queue for the tobacco counter until I could be served. I asked her why she had left me standing there for so long before she told me this and she ignored me. I was obviously quite cross about the situation and I called her and idiot which I completely understand was wrong of me. How can your customer service team be so unhelpful? I was clearly waiting to see someone and holding my heavy two year old so I really can t understand why no one spoke to me about why I was standing there for so long. Really bad service from this lady and it s a shame as the rest of the team at that store are always very friendly and helpful  what a letdown to your brand and values.					2016-12-03T17:54:40+0000	1480787680	2016-12-03 18:54:40	0	1	1	1	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

On opening it saw it was something to do with Star Wars but that was not obvious from the outside  and whatever it was surely guns have no place on a Christmas card?

You know  the ones you crack. Got home  all ready to get festive and enjoy them in front of the TV (would be an open fire  but we haven t got one) and  to our absolute shock  horror and devastation  we found we didn t have a nut cracker! How could we be so irresponsible? Who buys a bag of nuts without access to a nutcracker?   Anyway  over the next few days  I scour the shelves of every shop I enter. Not one had a nutcracker. Now  we do live in a small town so it s to be expected. We only really have charity shops and hairdressers here. We do  however  have a Sainsburys. They ll have one... Nope! I wasn t too much more disheartened at this point  I was going to our nearest big town on Friday  I would find one there.   Nope! I won t name every shop I tried  but I will say  there are some big names in that list  and not one had a nutcracker.   I was with my Mum  she could sense the devastation in her little (30 year old) girls eyes.  It s ok  she said  I ve got to run into Tesco  they ll have one . She put her arm around my shoulder  and lead the way. (The arm around the shoulder bit may or may not be strictly true)   We walked in to the very shop I d bought the nuts from  your Ashford  Park Farm store. We went down the kitchen accessories aisle. Nothing.  it s ok  she said again   they ll be where the nuts are . Nothing. We headed back to the kitchen aisle for one last look. Definitely not there. She went up to the nearest member of staff she could find. His name was Nick and he came over to have a look with us. A third pair of eyes could not seek out the nutcracker so he had a look on the app on his trusty smart phone. Nothing. Determined there MUST be some somewhere (I mean  you ARE Tesco) he went off in search of one and told us he d come and find us and let us know of his findings. He told us that they are usually on a  clip strip  so we knew what we were looking for.   A few minutes later  he found us. He was very apologetic and told us he couldn t find any. At that point  all of the festiveness in my bones drained away. I was never going to have my nuts.    it s ok   mum said   they have little packs down the nut aisle  they have a nutcracker in them  I ll get you one of them . So  she did  I finally had my nutcracker. Plus  extra nuts  bonus! That was yesterday.   Fast forward to today  I m back in Tesco doing the weekly shop. I m checking out the beef joints on display (half price  great offer!) when I see a jolly man in a Christmas jumper approaching me.    Nutcrackers  he said. It was Nick  the friendly nutcracker hunter from the day before. I smiled.  I found them  he said.  I ve put them on display. By the time I d found them and come to find you yesterday  you d gone .   All at once  the festiveness returned. He had continued his search after telling us he couldn t find any  and even tried to find us when he had. He remembered that and recognised me and stopped the conversation he was having with his colleague to come and tell me.   What an absolute super star!!   I cannot tell you how amazed I was to receive that service. It may seem trivial to some but you don t ever see that sort of service nowadays  especially with the big companies  and on a rammo Saturday in December.   I spent the rest of my shop with a smile on my face and very happy that it seemed important enough to Nick to carry on the search and then tell me the following day.   Could you please pass on my thanks to Nick and also  give him a nice fat Christmas bonus  some Roses (Cadbury  to say thank you very much) and a free day off.   Sorry for the ramble üòè but I think it s important for you to know that you have an amazing staff member in Nick and he s restored my festive cheer!   Merry Christmas!!					2016-12-03T17:06:44+0000	1480784804	2016-12-03 18:06:44	15	9	21	1	31	9	4	5	16	0	15	5	0	1	0	0	0

The lovely roses died off after about 2 weeks as expected but I cut these ones down to save them as they were still fine and another 2 weeks later  they are still going strong!! Best (and prettiest) flowers I have had in a long time and they weren t expensive! These ones appear to be indestructible! Looking forward to receiving another long lasting bunch! :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15267731_10157952159960604_3610231214854240017_n.jpg?oh=614a91acf5f87f072806374dcc371335&oe=58DA8F44	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15267731_10157952159960604_3610231214854240017_n.jpg?oh=5edec4aebbd97319889a5cc4afbdb401&oe=591CED49	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157952159960604&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-03T16:31:55+0000	1480782715	2016-12-03 17:31:55	7	2	7	0	9	2	2	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I set about making myself and my family some salads-it was going amazingly-everything looked great and we all knew we were in for a healthy treat but then disaster struck. On opening the can of sweet corn the smell of death hit me. Tesco-I have no idea what happened to this sweet corn  but I m horrified. What do I do now? Besides the obvious  of avoiding sweet corn (and indeed all tinned goods) for a couple years!					2016-12-03T16:31:18+0000	1480782678	2016-12-03 17:31:18	1	12	1	0	13	9	5	4	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A bit of a con and disgusted with this false advertisement by Tesco. Will definitely rethink shopping online with yourselves again. I was a very dedicated Tesco shopper.

We are now in the season when elves are invading the population of England s homes to be naughty or nice but ultimately to sneak a peek for Father Christmas on children s behaviour. As we are a little different here  we have a gingerbread man who does the same.   OK back to lunch... Pancakes are coming out the packet and goodness me  to our surprise Tesco has supplied our gingerbread man with his very own pancake  no bigger than the tip of a pen. Why isn t this advertised on the packet? Are you aware that this would be a magical marketing strategy?   To us in our little pocket of the world  we have a very happy gingerbread man and 4 happy little (hopefully on the nice list) children.   So Tesco  thank you from the bottom of our Christmas spirit and merry Christmas to you all.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15219630_10211591954375337_3255069348118888974_n.jpg?oh=901c9ce72e163cdd3cd88bd3aee14342&oe=58DBD74F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q85/s720x720/15219630_10211591954375337_3255069348118888974_n.jpg?oh=ec805422394509becb5652365339ae04&oe=58E4AD8B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211591954375337&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-03T14:03:42+0000	1480773822	2016-12-03 15:03:42	14	3	24	6	33	3	2	1	28	0	14	4	0	6	0	0	0

His treats will go a long way. Some are for him   some for food bank and some for his girlfriend Molly who Oggy has invited for the weekend. She is a Labrador  who is blissfully unaware Oggy adores her  and not overly impressed by energetic Spaniels but loves treats. He is curled up sleeping  and snoring  which gave me time to say Merry Christmas  xx					2016-12-03T13:38:01+0000	1480772281	2016-12-03 14:38:01	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last week having received traumatic news that a family member had died suddenly  I went to purchase fuel to make the long journey to my relatives home.  The ladies at the cash desk were quick to pull me to the side and advise I was too distraught to drive  offering me a coffee and a place to sit and calm down before continuing my journey.   The quick thinking of the staff on duty that evening stopped me from driving away in a teary emotional mess  which could have easily led to an accident.  Not only did they help me last week  but having fuelled up again yesterday they pooled together to buy me some flowers.  Service above and beyond!

I would just like to say that I am disappointed in your click and collect service. I placed an order early last Friday 25th November.  Later that day I had an email to say that my order had been dispatched and should be ready for collection on Wednesday 30th November.  It is now the 3rd December and it is still not ready to be collected  there has been no tracking updates since the the day I placed the order nor any communication from you  I have been into the store and all I was told was that I will just have to wait.					2016-12-03T09:58:32+0000	1480759112	2016-12-03 10:58:32	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My mother does not use the laptop very often but when she does  it shuts down website on its own  it freeze s  she cannot log in at times  the laptop has been a bit of a nightmare and very frustrating.  Since August I have taken the laptop back to Tesco Bangor which told me to contact  Tesco technical support  which my mother has as they could not solve the problem they have transferred my Mother over to Lenovo which still cant solve the problem  as it was with yourself my mother exchanged the money  can you please send a pre paid box and take the laptop back with full refund please  if the problem isn t solved I will be taking my mother to trading standards for advice on Monday.

Following payment I received an email stating that my order (4FHCC74NF) would be available for collection from my chosen store after 3pm today.  I received another email this morning stating that  there s a problem with items in your order  and that I will be refunded in 3-5 business days  with no further explanation.  I telephoned Tesco Direct and was told that it is  probably  out of stock (yet I can still order it online!). I appreciate that stock levels might not be updated every few minutes but I ordered this around 2pm yesterday and your website shows that it is STILL in stock.  I have an extremely disappointed little boy who was excited about decorating the tree this afternoon. When I explained this to your customer service representative he just apologised and suggested I call into my local store to see if they are on stock.  The main superstore is across town so I telephoned to check stock only to hear an automated message stating that they cannot check stock levels.  I have experienced good customer service from Tesco in the past but this has certainly put me off purchasing online goods from you in the future.  I would be grateful if you could resolve my complaint. I just want a tree this afternoon so that my son is can decorate it as I had promised him.  I look forward to hearing from you shortly.  Kind Regards  Claire Betteridge.					2016-12-03T09:22:38+0000	1480756958	2016-12-03 10:22:38	2	7	2	0	9	7	4	3	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

There is no invoice in either the large box or the ONE roll of wrapping paper (excessively packaged) to say if there is any reason for the missing items. Is it going to be delivered separately or not at all? Seeing as it s already been paid for. It s bad enough that when trying to order from your Direct site  I get ejected several times. My basket gets emptied and I have to start the whole process again. Then upon checking out  seeing various delivery charges as you split the order into 7 groups  charging up to ¬£7:95 for a ¬£1:00 item. This is why I very rarely shop with you any more!					2016-12-03T09:07:33+0000	1480756053	2016-12-03 10:07:33	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered the soup but asked for a gluten free roll as per my dietary requirements. I was told that the cafe does not stock gluten free rolls - even though they are clearly on a shelf downstairs. I then asked if the roll could be substituted for a couple of chips instead  to which I was told I would have to pay extra! I asked the lady  in that case  what would she substitute the roll for? The answer was  nothing . In the end my Dad chose to pay for extra chips for me just so that I had enough to eat  which was just as well as there were approximately 3 spoonfuls of soup in the meagre bowl. #epictescofail					2016-12-03T07:53:18+0000	1480751598	2016-12-03 08:53:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just tried to book one of your delivery slots for 23rd December for the Borehamwood store. Logged in at 12 and all the slots were already taken. I know you save some for priority customers but do you save any so us mere mortals have a a chance. FYI managed to book a slot for 21st which is now unavailable as well. You seem to have the same complaints every year but do nothing about it.					2016-12-03T00:21:03+0000	1480724463	2016-12-03 01:21:03	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wanted to write on here to publicly say a huge THANKYOU to your staff members at Tesco Addlestone (Station Road  Addlestone  KT15)  I am a committee member at my daughters charity funded pre school. I have spent the last week or so desperately trying to find donations for our Christmas fair after our main source of donations backed out with less than a week until the fair  we had literally nothing. I think in total this week alone I have been to at least 30 shops asking if they could help us out  I had up until Wednesday one donation of some mince pies ! On Tuesday I spoke to a staff member in your addlestone store to see if it was something they could do  to donate anything. I was told that sadly the lady I needed  called Jane wasn t in. I explained the position I was in and the fact it was for a pre school and a staff member actually went and called the lady on her day off. It just so happened she was actually in the store shopping. The lady didn t think twice and came and took my school letter and said there would be a gift card waiting for me Thursday morning and that I could either use it to buy prizes or use it as a prize. I was so grateful to finally have someone help. Up until then the reception I had had from other companies was disgusting and downright rude. It was so nice to find someone helpful which was still prepared to do what they could even on a day off.  Thursday came and I collected my voucher. Myself and the school secretary agreed it was best to use the voucher to get a few smellie sets and toys for prizes. So I went upstairs with my voucher and went hunting for bargains. Upstairs I saw a gentleman reducing a few toys. I cheekily asked if he was reducing anything else  explained my story again and how I had been going from shop to shop all week asking for help and just being turned away. I was literally ready to give up. The gentleman said to me  go and do some shopping or get a cup of tea  you ll have to give me half an hour and I ll see what I can do . I went with my daughter and we had a drink in the cafe and sure enough half hour later we were found by a man carrying a bundle of reduced items for us. It had electrical items  toys   headphones  computer games  I was speechless. So much so that I had to do my best not to cry. Then as if that wasn t enough he went off and came back with a coffee maker.  When I got back to my car I sat and cried. I ve been spoken to like rubbish  ignored and borderline shooed out of other shops this week  some of them well known companies. But the kindness and generosity of one store completely made up for it and we were able to fill our raffle with good prizes and it meant I didn t need to spend the gift voucher either.  I honestly can t say thankyou enough to Jane and Mark (I believe was the electrical manager) for everything they did. To help on a day off and to run round finding things I could have and coming to find me in the he store with prizes was above and beyond what I should imagine is their job. Our little pre school had the fair today and we made nearly ¬£400. We can now make our way to ordering a new climbing frame for them and other much needed resources. I know I have said it lots but honestly  thankyou for the help given to the school and thankyou on a personal level for not making my week a complete disaster					2016-12-02T21:03:28+0000	1480712608	2016-12-02 22:03:28	21	8	24	2	34	8	7	1	7	0	21	3	0	0	0	0	0

Yet today 2nd December 2016 at 4:30pm I had a very unpleasant experience at your store that has shaken my belief in your ability to provide customer care at all times.  After a day out doing Christmas shopping with my son we needed to call into the store to pick up some wrapping paper and bits of food etc for my son as it was the only available time he would have to do this  being back in work the next day within the hospitality business. My daughter who attends Runshaw college had forgotten her keys and phoned to find out where I was so I suggested she met me and my son in the store to pick them up as her father was picking her up at 5:30 for the weekend and she needed to get her clothes etc ready..  After putting the bits that we needed into the trolley   including three bottles of larger and three bottles of cider for my son to take home with him we went to try and find till that was free. There were only a few cashier operating and the store was busy so my sun decided to use the self check out service. We put the food through the till and obviously with alcohol the staff need to check id etc which I appreciate‚Ä¶Me being 49 It wasn‚Äôt needed but my son is 25 and had id with him. He was then told that as my daughter was stood with us he was NOT allowed to purchase the alcohol because it was ‚ÄòAgainst the Law‚Äô and was asked to take them off his bill.   I explained that I was well known in the store and shop there most days and most of the shop workers know me  not only from shopping but I also feed the homeless in the local area and get some very much appreciated donations from Tesco. Also it was Not a Law or an Act if the person purchasing the alcohol had valid id. The staff member then said that it was Tesco Law and policy and it was not going to be allowed also mentioning that she couldn‚Äôt use her common sense in this issue as they were not allowed to at Tesco?  Not only was I deeply embarrassed by this situation as it was at a busy time and people were watching but we were 100% innocent in our purchase yet were made to feel extremely uncomfortable. I understand that there is a big issue with under age drinkers and I absolutely stand by the fact that it has to be stopped but in this incident I feel the store was completely out of order. Yet I was told that it was the ‚Äòlaw‚Äô that if an underage child was with an adult and they are purchasing alcohol it is NOT allowed. I wonder how many families come through your stores each day with children under the age of 18 doing their weekly shop with wine and beer etc in their shopping trolley. If what I was told was the Law then I have to say ALL these people must have their alcohol removed from their shopping as we were made to this afternoon?  We were abiding by the law and had id and were both over the age of 18..especially me!!! If you are to have standards in your store they have to be fair and they have to be followed through with EVERYONE who shops in any of your stores.   I am a decent parent and do NOT allow my daughter to drink alcohol nor does her father yet we were persecuted for no reason what so ever and made a complete mockery out of. It ruined what had been a very nice day with my hard working son who I see very little of at the best of times.  Rules are there to abide by but you have to allow your staff to use common sense and also to judge a situation in the appropriate way.   My son asked as my daughter had gone to meet her dad if he could then come back and purchase what HE needed and was told categorically NO!!!! He is nearly 26 yrs old with id and again I say I am 49 and as it stands we were pretty much told tonight we can not purchase alcohol from Tesco???? I went to the smaller Tesco on Canberra road where I know the manager well and told him and to say he was shocked was an understatement as he knows the sort of person I am and they also help me with the homeless donations. This small Tesco is a credit to your store and the staff have always been absolutely lovely with everyone who goes in  its just a shame the main store in Leyland has let your company down.   Legally we were completely entitled to purchase the items required and it is NOT against the law if you are over 18 and can prove it. I would like to think that this isn t going to happen to any other decent hard working people again and maybe a bit of training in this matter may be required because obviously they were completely out of order and had no idea what the Law  and Acts regarding underage drinking are!   As a long term customer I will now reconsider shopping at this store due to the embarrassment caused by the scene that was made when I asked to speak with the store manager. I was told no one was available. Well it‚Äôs the general public who buy the produce that pay YOUR wages so a bit of compassionate customer service would have been expected and appreciated.

Due to this short notice  I needed to get some travel adapters. I checked on your website to see if you sell them - you do  excellent! I get to the store  wander around the electrical department for ages  can t find them. Wait in the queue for the click and collect - some in stock  awesome. Oh wait  they can t be delivered tomorrow because it s after 3pm on a Friday  and the earliest they can be in store is Monday. I m flying out tomorrow evening. Frustrated  as I saw them on your website as in stock and not on click and collect. Ask a colleague walking round who says they should be in the electrical department. Queue again for the electrical desk  only to be told that they are in stock - in the pet food isle. Why on earth are they in the pet food isle?!?! No wonder I couldn t find them! A little bit of common sense when deciding where to place things in the store would bit a bit helpful. The gentlemen on the electrical desk was very helpful and apologetic  but next time you make a design layout please try and make it make sense. When I have a lot of things to do  silly layouts only serve to stress people out more. Otherwise  you re awesome. Keep it up.					2016-12-02T19:32:02+0000	1480707122	2016-12-02 20:32:02	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

These cords are purposefully made very long so that if a disabled or elderly person falls and cannot get up they can reach the cord from the floor.  It is bad enough when these cords are looped around the support handles at the side of the toilet so they are off the floor and  out of the way  perhaps for floor cleaning or so they don t get pulled accidentally. But this cord was purposefully knotted and tied up so high that I could only just touch it with my fingertips  and I am an able bodied adult. Ok so I m not the tallest person  (5 3  on a good day) but there are plenty of people shorter or less able than me who would not be able to reach it at all  especially those in a WHEELCHAIR! Nevermind anyone who had actually fallen to the floor!  Please make sure the store amends this and perhaps inform the rest of your stores to ensure their emergency cords are actually usable in an emergency?!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15232172_10157808979690321_4111576240392348578_n.jpg?oh=d1ece6723a7630bce99fc3d6620a323e&oe=58E238C2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15232172_10157808979690321_4111576240392348578_n.jpg?oh=a1ca9dda00a0209e2105610371d55d50&oe=58E8B5CF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157808979690321&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-02T18:59:04+0000	1480705144	2016-12-02 19:59:04	1	3	1	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a specialised voucher from daily mail to get one yet your stores conveniently dont have them or cannot even find them on the system.

Lot of fresh food with 2 days  until sell by date.  Many Chicken Products.  Called to complain and Tesco not moving and they say 2 days is acceptable really? asked to speak to a manager and await a response. This is not first time this happens it appears tesco get rid of older stock to home delivery customers. Happen to anyone else? Xmas shop with Tesco looking to be going to Aldi/Sainsbury! UPDATE Manager called and refunded items. We will monitor the future deliveries and see how they are.					2016-12-02T17:07:03+0000	1480698423	2016-12-02 18:07:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Super delivery driver  he really helped me out as I was stuck with baby in arms. Unfortunately I am a bit disappointed with the dates on this veg - we are a family of 6 but even we would struggle to eat this much veg today/tomorrow!! The carrot ends are already dry and splitting and a bit yucky and the parsnips are a bit hairy already too (unsurprising given date!) Perhaps an option to select a short date when ordering  or like most other online supermarkets you could just choose dates as far ahead as possible. Sorry to moan  I just don t like waste!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15327419_10100190109845508_3786540929782250891_n.jpg?oh=f2097ab9fed5fb243e51bb27c1e8553e&oe=58DAEAFA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/15327419_10100190109845508_3786540929782250891_n.jpg?oh=57d9af11446615d197a2d0702c4c3e24&oe=58EE4C8E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100190109845508&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-02T12:29:48+0000	1480681788	2016-12-02 13:29:48	0	3	0	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So off I went to store to be told one parcel couldn t be found so could I call back on friday  2nd. My response being no I need the item for a birthday present. Why send a text out to be told my item can t be found.  So she told me to come back in an hour. In which I did after I had to get to other appointments I d made for the day. To then drive back the 8 miles to collect my parcel. (time wasted) She still couldn t find it so I ended up with her getting one off the sales floor.  Which is very good of her to offer but why was this not done before hand instead of wasting my time coming back and forth.  I then get home to unpack my other parcel to find this damaged boxed inside. I am so disappointed how am I supposed to give that as a present.  Looks like I ve brought it second hand. I am Really considering returning the item for a refund and taking my custom elsewhere as I don t know if this is going happen again.  The service I have received from yourselves is upsetting.

Another store gave the crappy excuse of   we re not doing any more inductions  but interview was only last week. And the last store we ll see about. The first store I ve tried to contact and no one is available to talk to. I appreciate the time of year but I m left wondering if Tesco really cares.					2016-12-02T08:00:54+0000	1480665654	2016-12-02 09:00:54	2	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	7	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve sat waiting and checking each day to see if they have been released  currently the latest date is Wednesday 21st December.  My customer advised me today that they got released on the 26th November.   She logged on with her PC and it displayed the slots available  obviously now all the Christmas slots have been taken. There was one slot left on Friday 23rd. So I quickly logged on my app to book it and still only displays dates up until 21st December!

Today I walked in to Tesco express in high road Wembly (near the Poundland) to buy some crisp  I bought an packet of crisps and paid by my card. As soon as I walked out the shop I stared to eat crips and finished half of the bag hence I was so hungry. After reaching home I had to go straight to the toilet hence my stomach start to ache. I felt I was food poisoned and I grabbed the crisp bag to just check and I saw it was expired. I was so disgusted that I have consumed that crips and now I m not feeling well. How could Tesco s so ignorant on consumers. I will log a compliment with CAB and Trading  standards.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15056467_1781280812123819_6208774948934773097_n.jpg?oh=85279d60fef70925ac2a8293fac23459&oe=58DF5EA7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15056467_1781280812123819_6208774948934773097_n.jpg?oh=ff1a2ea23dd7a3641aadd7b04c2e332a&oe=58E2FBB2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1781280812123819&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-01T23:20:16+0000	1480634416	2016-12-02 00:20:16	2	12	2	1	15	11	10	1	14	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was unable to leave her on her own in your store as she is autistic and needs someone with her at all times while in busy environments so I had to travel from your middleton store to rochdale just to buy what I needed.

I mainly do my shopping online and like Karen asked in her post would like a way to donate to charities ie food banks rspca etc while online shopping and possibly even a round up function to donate money. Second the odd times I do come in store I normally have my 6 month old son with me. If he is in a pushchair and I only want a few bits would love a basket on wheels so I don t have to carry a full heavy basket while pushing a pushchair.

In the Black Friday sales I ordered an Amazon fire tablet bundle which came with with a case and a memory card for ¬£49.99. I paid for this purchase on 25/11/2016 and it was meant to be delivered with my grocery shopping today.  When the Tesco delivery driver arrived with my food shopping he informed me that my order had been cancelled or damaged he didn t know which one it was.  I rang customer services to find out what was going on and they informed me that my product arrived in my store (bradley stoke  Bristol) on the 28/11/2016 and was checked by the staff and product was fine. But today 01/12/2016 at 11.22am it was found to be damaged. Whilst speaking to the customer service team they promised me that when my item came back into stock (as it is now out of stock) I could have my item delivered but they couldn t tell me when that would be. I rang back 30 mins later and I was informed that I was now getting a refund which I hadn t asked for and that I would have to pay again when my item came back into stock. I then asked if I could have the items separately and obviously get it for the price I originally paid. They informed me that I could do that but I would have to pay an extra ¬£69.72 to get the items and then they would refund me the difference. I can ill afford to do this especially so close to Christmas and bills coming out. I am shocked at the level of incompetence of your staff who have clearly somehow damaged my purchase whilst in their care. I am also clearly angry at the lack of communication I have received. I am also upset and confused as to why I would have to pay the extra money when I haven t received the money I originally paid back into my account.   Nobody seems to know what is going on and the level of customer service is shocking. Considering I pay for your delivery saver and spend the amount I do with your company monthly. My purchase was meant to be my 9 year old sons main Christmas present so I have now had to go to Amazon directly to the items in order to make sure my son gets his present. No offer of compensation for all this suffering has been made. I am seriously considering shopping elsewhere from now on.

I tend to now buy my groceries and get them delivered at home.  Is there any way to add the capability to your website so that I can pick a few items to donate to a foodbank from my shop?  Doesn t have to be local - would just be good to make it easier for me to help support.  Thanks :-)					2016-12-01T20:10:57+0000	1480623057	2016-12-01 21:10:57	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

First they stopped selling the bread and were making a multi seeded loaf instead. Either when enough people complained or sales tanked they bought the lovely bread back...... a couple of times I bought the loaf recently and thought they had mislabelled it as it was full of seeds a different colour texture and flavour  this last occasion when shopping at the Kingston store it was again this yucky seeded bread so I asked to be told this was the malted grain bread and that was the recipe head office were sending. If your going to change a product that drastically  rename it don t try and pretend it s the same thing! Then the turkey bacon disappeared from the shelves to be replaced by Tesco own turkey rashers (now I know Tesco do this regularly sell something and then make their own version and stop selling the original and the Tesco version is usually not as nice) but not as nice doesn t cover this the turkey rashers are horrible they are tasteless have questionable pieces of turkey that are not meant to be eaten in them and are not even remotely likeable. When the Tesco replacement products don t work they disappear and as far as I have noticed the originals don t reappear.....					2016-12-01T18:59:54+0000	1480618794	2016-12-01 19:59:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I explained that the slot was booked from 17:00-18:00- he continued to tell me how long he had been waiting for me and made me feel like I was in the wrong because he had to wait for me!! I ve never experienced this before from other supermarkets and the ones that have arrived early have always contacted me prior to check this is okay.					2016-12-01T18:20:20+0000	1480616420	2016-12-01 19:20:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I returned them to the store where I purchased them   where I did get a refund  a less than meaningful sorry and told they had none left to replace them. No offer of anything as a replacement or a call to another local store to source any. So I now have 3 children  only one of whom has an advent calendar. Disappointed Tesco  very disappointed.

Ive just been into tesco extra pontypridd and noticed f1 2016 limited edition on ps4 for ¬£30. There was no out of stock label so i thought  happy days its a surprise xmas present for my other half . After waiting a good 20 mins at the customer service desk  as some bright spark has decided to close the electricals desk (really does not make any sense at this time of year)  only to be told there was none in stock. I said to the poor woman on customer services that the f.m.c.department needs to sort out their game with out of stock labels only to be told the managers insist on the games cases being on display even if there are none in stock. Whose stupid idea was that?? Lets lead the customer to beleive that what they want to get as a surprise xmas gift is in stock then make them wait 20 mins only to be told jokes on you  we aint got any!					2016-12-01T16:05:48+0000	1480608348	2016-12-01 17:05:48	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I didn t get my lunch  could you make it up to me please Tesco?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/15326464_10157871464275083_2253064576534964507_n.jpg?oh=c3ca6d761237dbb05a3c4199768346c8&oe=58E4ABB3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/15326464_10157871464275083_2253064576534964507_n.jpg?oh=5d25a0fc8ae18fd1558c65aea598e089&oe=58D8F8A0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157871464275083&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-01T14:59:30+0000	1480604370	2016-12-01 15:59:30	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So to the cupboard they go and take out the last sachet of kitten food. The sachet feels odd  the owners worry it has split or blown and gone off.  With trepidation they open it  no smell!!! Hooray!! All is saved. They squeeze into the eager Stanleys bowl....but wait what is this??? The kitten size chunks are missing!! Thats right not a morsel of meat to be seen.   Stanley was inconsolable and collapsed with grief over his meat free breakfast.  So please Tesco tell me what you can do to revive Stanleys spirits because I dont think he wants to be a vegatarian!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15284965_10153877358216883_8787285031834182583_n.jpg?oh=5d8fd253d82d107af08e48918d9827d4&oe=58D93CDC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15284965_10153877358216883_8787285031834182583_n.jpg?oh=fbefa244f19e5878510c3114286c957a&oe=58D932D1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153877358216883&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-01T14:40:14+0000	1480603214	2016-12-01 15:40:14	16	8	24	0	32	8	2	6	2	0	16	1	0	7	0	0	0

NEVER again will I eat at your store all the unoccupied tables needed clearing so we moved all the dirty things to another table when our drinks were bought over no offer to wipe the table down or provide a cloth for us to do this. Cutlery was bought over  I would like to say clean however this was not the case. Our breakfasts arrived rather quickly-the only good experience. We commenced to eat however after a couple of bites we knew this was the biggest mistake we made  the bacon was trying to run off the plate it was that undercooked the sausage was black one side and still pink the other we unanimously decided the eggs had been cooked in washing up liquid and 1 person had to dash off to throw up. We decided none of us wished to risk food poisoning for the sake of not wanting to waste food. As we were leaving we spoke to the counter staff stating that the food was extremely poor they asked the manager to come and speak to us upon telling her our issues and telling her it was still on the table if she wanted to check the quality. The manager told us we should have spoken to them and it could have been resolved?!  Maybe the staff require in customer service and complaints management.					2016-12-01T13:49:49+0000	1480600189	2016-12-01 14:49:49	1	9	1	0	10	9	6	3	8	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The bakery was  for the 2nd time in around 3 years  refurbished and re-opened around 31st October. For the first few weeks  it stocked some new ranges of loose items such as cheese and onion focaccia  mediterranean focaccia  pizza pockets  chocolate brownies  tiffin slices  rocky road etc. These have gradually disappeared and now there are empty shelves on a daily basis; please see photos. I have also witnessed many customers standing around wanting bread loaves sliced  but no member of staff is ever present and a lot of customers simply walk away!

It s beautiful and wondersome and rich.  However  myself and my colleagues have spent months (okay  weeks) trying to work out why on earth you would put egg mayo in it and where  in fact  the egg mayo is. This has included picking the sandwich apart and inspecting tiny cubes of Stilton for any eggy-ness.  We have only just worked out what  in fact  the ingredient actually is. We (I) feel foolish.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/15056483_10154141944715840_6409513518039628915_n.jpg?oh=013171b4177537379268b2e5cddee9da&oe=58ED2862	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/15056483_10154141944715840_6409513518039628915_n.jpg?oh=9d5c1d1325ec2141d902441a996d88c0&oe=58E4986F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154141944715840&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-12-01T11:43:55+0000	1480592635	2016-12-01 12:43:55	5	7	9	0	16	7	4	3	3	0	5	0	0	4	0	0	0

After I d cooked it I noticed it didn t smell right. I tasted it and all I.could taste was mulled wine. Looked on the back of the packaging on the list of ingredients to see that it did indeed contain mulled wine. Who in their right minds adds mulled wine to a blackberry and apple crumble and why  given the fact it s such an overpowering flavour is this not made clear on the front of the packaging?

I seem to remember that they were ¬£2.50 until very recently.  Isn t this just another example of Tesco raising prices on something so that you can bring it back down to the same price and then claim a reduction? As a company you do that ALL the time and your customers know fine well that you do it all the time - what we really want is stable prices (fairly low but not at the expense of giving your staff a decent wage!)  Tesco has only just started to regain some of the customers it lost to Aldi and Lidl and when that great exodus occurred many analysts put it down to the lack of honest price transparency in Tesco (where prices go up and down all the time and where they get put up to crazy prices for a few weeks so that you can claim they have been reduced). Continuing to do this rather annoying business practice  which may keep within our rather weak laws  comes across to many of your customers (including me) as a rather awful business practice.					2016-12-01T10:47:56+0000	1480589276	2016-12-01 11:47:56	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
