Surely Tesco should be promoting fresh fruits and vegetables? I personally know many people who agree with my opinion that these bags should be removed from circulation. Tesco sell plenty of healthy choices that are tastier and obviously healthier than dead animals. Why not advertise these instead?

I posted on this page on the 3rd of January telling you about the fact my Christmas was ruined because I had been sold a Turkey Crown that was off even though the it was dated 26th December. I took it back and got a refund no questions asked just a poor lad looking absolutely terrified but to my horror not at all surprised!!! How many had been returned to him that day I wonder? Anyway I received a response that I took as  oh well sorry about that at least you got a full refund  oh and happy new year!  so again I told you how unhappy I was with this response -  (seeing as I had a large gathering of two families coming together for us to celebrate our first Christmas as Mr & Mrs!!! Now every time we look back at our amazing year we are reminded that Tesco s totally ruined the ending!) - The response I got was along the lines of - I m sorry about that response what you should have been told was this would be escalated and you will receive a response within 14 days! Now this second reply was on the 16th and it is now the 31st and I have still not been contacted this is absolutely disgraceful. I have a feeling you have also deleted my post as I have sat here and trailed through for 2 hours to find it and can t  if you have this is very cowardly. I have though seen thousands and thousands of pictures and complaints regarding the food (especially the FRESH produce) you sell being unfit for human consumption  as I said in my first complaint I spent on average ¬£500-¬£700 per month in your stores/online and on petrol  and have done for over 10 years....never had to complain before and I hope I never will again...luckily there is a Aldi opening down the road from me and hear their Fresh produce is outstanding maybe I should take my money there instead.....Disgraceful TESCO S					2016-01-31T17:42:33+0000	1454262153	2016-01-31 18:42:33	0	12	0	0	12	12	3	9	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For two reasons . Firstly your advertising campaign strongly indicates to people that if they have a product   such as Kelloggs cornflakes they will get the difference off if it is cheaper elsewhere( over the participating supermarkets) but this is averaged over your branded shop. The second flaw is that not all of your branded shop is available in all the comparative supermarkets!					2016-01-31T12:46:12+0000	1454244372	2016-01-31 13:46:12	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I like scan and shop as it saves time I do not like to be humiliated by having all my shopping re scanned in front of all the public. im not a thief and this is how it made me feel.

I arrived at your Eston store this evening and asked if customer services was still open. The lady said you have 2 minutes. So I said great as I need to return my slow cooker as it is one of the recalled ones. At that point she said I don t have time for that   you will have to come back tomorrow! Now I have been at work since 8.30 am (sat)  and I am on a 8.30 -6pm shift (sunday) so I will not be able to return tomorrow.  What has annoyed me is yes  I did get there late as I didn t realise I would get out of work so late as it was busy   was the fact that I had 2 minutes spare and then it was as if she couldn t be bothered to sort out a product which has been recalled by yourselves. Also are any stores in the north east selling  the rainbow roses? I absolutely  love these flowers but can t seem to find a store that sells them.  Thank you.					2016-01-30T23:44:54+0000	1454197494	2016-01-31 00:44:54	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an order yesterday to be delivered between 8pm-9pm today. By 9.30pm no order received. I rang tesco groceries  who was unable to get the driver or the store. They escalated my call which was going to be dealt with by the delivery team and told they would contact me. By 10.45pm still no sign of groceries or any calls from tesco  so I rang again  but this time no one answered my call. I held on for 15 minutes  then ended the call as lines close at 11pm. I get my groceries delivered every month and would be quite loyal to tesco.

Every time I go to a Tesco store and I purchase chicken etc  and have to ask for a bag for my meat  which is a legal obligation for supermarkets to supply  without payment of the carrier bag tax  I am offered a bag that is of inadequate size  of inadequate quality  have holes in  or they don t have even have any at the checkout so you have to wait for an inadequate bag to be supplied  when you ask. I ve even been told by one of your largest stores in the country they don t even have any! This doesn t happen at Asda  Sainsbury s  or Waitrose.  COME ON TESCO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER  ABIDE BY THE LAW.  I look forward to your response in this matter					2016-01-30T21:41:13+0000	1454190073	2016-01-30 22:41:13	3	5	3	0	8	5	2	3	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

It comes up with an error message saying tesco direct don t accept visa electron. It s not a visa electron card though and its supposed to be accepted wherever MasterCard is accepted. Any ideas? Because it s really frustrating.					2016-01-30T21:25:54+0000	1454189154	2016-01-30 22:25:54	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A 5 year old and a almost 1 year old (17/2/16). I have just sorted through both girls clothes as we are due to buy next size up and i can honestly.say that i have been impressed with the quality of the clothes we have used this last 6 months. They wash well and last a lot longer than most other brands. So i will continue to purchase lovely outfits and i am able to pass the old ones on to a dear friend as they still have plenty of life left in them. Thanks again.  Maxine and girls.					2016-01-30T21:22:16+0000	1454188936	2016-01-30 22:22:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They are very eager to spend a week with you in your Bursledon Tesco Extra store  as they believe they would have everything they need! We ve gone through the blow up beds to sleep on; food and drink would be on tap; plenty of shower gel etc to wash with; games to play on the tv s; new clothes and shoes to wear everyday; and magazines to read. I m currently 34 weeks pregnant and would LOVE the break if you fancy helping me out? Haha!   I promise they are well behaved (and the kids) and I promise to pick them up after a week.

I was struggling to find the ingredients for my meal today  and without even asking your veg dept advisors approached me to ask if I needed a hand. They where so friendly and went out of their way to help me  even going into the store room to find me what I needed  despite the fact they must ve been incredibly busy as the shop was jam packed.Not only this  but I observed them helping other customers in the same way. It really was a breath of fresh air  as most stores I visit  particularly supermarkets  the staff do not even acknowledge customers. I would appreciate it if you passed on my thanks to your colleagues. Also  the young girl serving on the basket only till deserves a mention as she too was very friendly and chatty  and didn t rush me and my toddler along  which is always nice.					2016-01-30T19:53:51+0000	1454183631	2016-01-30 20:53:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately when I got the shopping home and was putting it away my husband noticed that the box for the liquid tabs was very light. We then discovered that the sticky tab holding the box shut had been cut through and there was now only 5 in the box. Absolutely disgusted that some people sink that low as to take the tabs from the box  leaving paying customers to pay. People beware  check the boxes before you pay. Otherwise your washing could turn out to be very expensive.					2016-01-30T19:42:57+0000	1454182977	2016-01-30 20:42:57	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got told sorry but we cannot make any more pizzas today as we ve run out of cheese! Incredible! A pizza bar with no cheese. Picked a ready made one from the front with what I describe as a bit of pepperoni on and asked if I could have 3 more toppings on that. Only 1 I was reluctantly told. They put some spicy chicken on and I said please just a bit of red onion and pineapple. Much shaking of heads with a comment just a bit of onion. Not even to make up for not getting the Pizza I wanted  no! So rude  not even a genuine apology  no notice to tell customers who were still coming in. This must be the sixth or so time they have run out of stuff or not even been open! What s the point of it being there if it s never stocked correctly  pathetic and you need to sort this and train your staff in customer service Tesco  not happy!					2016-01-30T19:11:17+0000	1454181077	2016-01-30 20:11:17	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I waited in all day an called them at 5 when it hadnt arrived. Was told it s been delivered and signed for at 11.27. There was only me and young children here at that time and no one knocked the door and if they left it at a neighbors they would ve left a card but as I was in anyway I can t see why they would deliver to a neighbour. Tesco said they would look into it and call me straight back. Hours later I am still waiting. Going to have one very upset son now and it s caused so much hassle. This is the second order in a row u have failed to deliver. At Xmas I had to make a 10 mile journey to store and back to collect the item u failed to deliver.

Sunday at 8pm I had my home delivery  as I picked up the bag the bleach was in I realise the bleach was open covering me! The delivery lady was so apologetic and fantastic. She phoned it straight through. I then also phoned customer services to be greeted by another helpful member of staff. I was told someone from the store my items were picked from would phone me tomorrow (Monday). By this point I was ok not angry these things happen  ok I have bleach all over my clothes and hands but hey! So no phone call Monday  again Tuesday my phone remains silent! I phone CS again Wednesday and again spoke to a helpful person  they phoned through to the store and was told manager would phone me back as was busy but would phone by 5  also they would send the relevant forms out so i d get them Thursday/Friday. Again no phone call. Heard nothing Thursday or Friday and nothing came through the post. So it gets to Saturday and I m pretty fuming by this point  I had ruined cloths and the bleach on my hands has badly aggravated my eczema so my hands are sore and red raw. Again I m told manager busy but unavailable but would phone me back at 3 to confirm forms have been sent and to apologise. Well surprise surprise once again I ve had no phone call.

I bought the phone home and put my sim card in and also tried another  sim not recognised came up  i notice the contact strip didnt look right.  I put it back in the box until today when I took it back. The girl was pleasant but had to call the manger  he more or less accused me of damaging it myself  ive has loads of phones and have never had a problem inserting a sim card before. Not happy   we spend thousands in that shop. I will not be buying anything else except food from now on. Whats a ¬£70 phone to them!!!!					2016-01-30T16:25:45+0000	1454171145	2016-01-30 17:25:45	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a last resort was marched across to customer services ( at which point you were nearly left with a trolley full of my shopping) Tried card at customer services and lo and behold all was ok. Not happy with the way things were handled  always shop at Tesco which you can check I am sure.

Only shows a picture of my car entering the car park and leaving. It doesn t take into consideration the hours of driving round looking for a space or the massive queue Betty had on checkout 12. She couldn t get one of those security tags off a DVD. Lesbian vampire killers I think it was. Is Betty paying this fine or should I just forget about it.					2016-01-30T08:43:47+0000	1454143427	2016-01-30 09:43:47	3	9	3	0	12	9	8	1	8	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I like to think I ve been a good customer over the years and generally you ve been a pretty good supermarket  (even when you do make random substitutions!)  however today was not your finest hour. I like to get my shopping delivered every now and then  when I really need to that is because actually I quite like to get out and do it myself. Also I m sure there s others out there who need the home delivery far more than I do  although at the moment I m pretty house bound myself. I ordered my shopping to be delivered tonight between 9pm - 10pm  when it got to 10.20pm and I d not heard anything  I made a call to find out what was going on. No-one could tell me where my order was or get hold of the driver (I hope they are OK BTW.) 11pm came still no shopping and I m advised that it may not turn up and there s no slots for tomorrow morning  so what do I do now? I m a single parent  currently off work recovering from an operation and I have a broken wrist so even if I wanted to do my own shopping  I can t right now. I d be really grateful if someone could tell me when or even if I can expect my shopping? Order number 204281276.					2016-01-29T23:38:39+0000	1454110719	2016-01-30 00:38:39	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I told her not to start the car and we would push it to the side (to avoid holding people up from using the pump) and then she could arrange for the car to be pumped out. Unfortunately the car could not be pushed as it had an electronic handbrake and would not release. As there is no kiosk at the Banchory petrol station I suggested that we went to customer services and tell them about the car and enquire if they had any kind of service they offered for this type of situation. I had heard that Tesco had a deal with RAC to come out and sort this type of problem out. Unfortunately the lady on the counter told us that they couldn t help and we should move the car as soon as possible as it would now be holding people up. As I had to get to work  the best I could do was drive the poor lady to the nearest garage and let her work it out from there  so hopefully she got sorted out. However  when I checked the Tesco PFS website it seems you do have this service and even give the number to call should this happen. If the woman on customer services had informed us of this  it would have saved the poor lady a lot of stress  instead of making her feel even worse by insisting the car was moved without delay! I suggest the customer services staff of stores with petrol stations are informed of the service you offer  as I am sure there are others who will find them in this stressful situation and would welcome an easy fix!! There will also not always be someone around willing to take the person to the nearest garage either.					2016-01-29T22:20:07+0000	1454106007	2016-01-29 23:20:07	1	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The delivery driver called us and ranted that the instructions we left were not specific enough to find us (we have your delivery every week and all your prior drivers were able to find us). He was very pedantic on the phone and said he was not sure whether he would come back. We called him again half an hour later  and at this point he said he was with a customer and put the phone down on us. I am here with a 5 month old baby  no baby formula (which ran out earlier  this evening and is supposed to be in the delivery) and the local supermarket closed at 8. Your customer service line is experiencing high call volumes and so I cannot get any clarity on what will happen now and whether this delivery will ever turn up. I d like to think most of your delivery drivers are courteous and helpful (certainly what I have seen so far) but I would not want this individual representing my brand.					2016-01-29T21:55:12+0000	1454104512	2016-01-29 22:55:12	1	8	1	0	9	8	6	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Strange you don t do that to me on a Saturday when you relieve me if ¬£150.00. Tesco Hednesford you should be ashamed of yourselves. All outlets can have there share of unsociable behaviour from kids with nothing better to do. However labelling all minors the same shows both immaturity and a definite inability for your security guard to carry out his job effectively. Tesco Hednesford change your hiring policy and procedures or lose your customers. Disgusting behaviour from such a supposedly customer focused company.					2016-01-29T21:34:42+0000	1454103282	2016-01-29 22:34:42	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in to do my monthly shop with a 2.5 year old and a 6 month old. I had rather a large shop and for ease I always use scan and shop. I went to the checkout when I got selected for a  random check.  A lovely young man came to sort it out. He got half way through and the handset froze. He went to get him team leader who came. They kept apologising for the delay. The same happened to her so she decided it would be quicker to put it through the checkout. She got another member of staff to help. The man unloaded whilst the other assistant got another trolley and packed and the leader put it through. All the while my 2 year old was happy to help them. After half an hour it was all put through and found the scanner device was faulty as the shop was cheaper than what the device said as it had multiple scanned several items.what surprised me most was that they presented me with a bunch of flowers for all the problems it has caused me.  Then an assistant helped me take it out to the car load the shopping and the children and took the trolleys away.I was so overwhelmed at the customer service it has endeared me more to shop in this shop in future. Thank you to those members of staff who helped me you went above and beyond and showed just what incredible members of staff you have to help your customers have a pleasant experience in store. They are a credit to your organisation.					2016-01-29T20:43:11+0000	1454100191	2016-01-29 21:43:11	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This family member has  done the right thing  and informed Tesco who has said that they are cancelling her car insurance. She has asked to keep it as her partner may still drive the car occasionally and also she wants it insured in case the car gets stolen whilst sitting out the front of their home. Tesco has declined but won t clarify why ... I understand many other insurers provide this service. They have also declined to put insurance on hold for 5 months as requested (7 months of no claims to be lost because of this)  she understands cost may go up and is happy to pay balance but again the answer is no. Surely this is discriminatory behaviour towards someone who has already paid for the whole year? Any reasons for this behaviour would be gratefully received.					2016-01-29T20:38:45+0000	1454099925	2016-01-29 21:38:45	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As the social demo graphic moves upward and the wholefood shops and delis move in  alongside and a more educated media savvy population  Tescos products sink lower and lower. You would think with 15 crates of potatos  there would be room for an organic one...same applies to cheese. When I spoke to the manager the other day  she informed me that she has zero say in what is stocked in her store  and that Tesco send her plans of what she has to stock where  and they do this without carrying out any instore research. I have never heard anything so ridiculous in all my life. It is no wonder Tesco is losing it s market share. I rarely shop there now   for the above reasons  and I know others who have stopped too.

The new  improved  voice on the self-service machines is almost as irritating as the old one  but one of the most annoying things is the phrase  insert your clubcard to win clubcard points . WIN?? They are not prizes. If I insert my clubcard  I expect to collect the points that I have earned by buying things; I am NOT entering a competition! If I WAS entering a competition I would want a chance to win something more useful than clubcard points which I never have a chance to use.					2016-01-29T19:35:53+0000	1454096153	2016-01-29 20:35:53	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered my shopping to be delivered between 8pm & 12pm yesterday  due to a mistake with my bank that order was rebooked for today  for the same time slot. The driver phoned and told me it was under the wrong address and explained he couldn t deliver to my address as it was classed as fraud. So I rang customer services who told me it had been rearranged to be delivered between 2 & 3pm. At 3pm  still no delivery. I rang back and they said to wait  I waited until 4.30pm  still nothing. So I rang again and I was told they were unable to get through to the store so would ring me back when they had spoken to someone  come 5pm  no call back  so I phoned and was told that the dot com manager was personally recollecting my shopping as it had been put back on the shelves  and delivering it to the correct address.  Now come 7.20pm  I ve rang again twice to be told the manager is no longer in store as she s delivering to a customer in Twickenham. Unfortunately that is not where I live. I m unsure if this is a miscommunication but I have been waiting for my shopping since 8am. Customer services have tried there absolute hardest to help with no luck.  So after waiting around for 11 hours  I still have no food.  Thanks tesco üëç					2016-01-29T19:21:16+0000	1454095276	2016-01-29 20:21:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I saw the product recall for your own brand slow cookers and mine had to be recalled so I took the item back tonight and was given an exchange with one off the shelf. I have just got home and was taking it out the box to see this is the model been recalled. They should of been taken off the shelves. I need my slow cooker for tomorrow and I am un able to make a trip back to the store with my young baby tomorrow. So I guess I have to go without it again !!					2016-01-29T19:15:46+0000	1454094946	2016-01-29 20:15:46	0	9	0	0	9	9	9	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Very annoyed by what s just happened in your Long Eaton branch - all over Christmas there were a pair of Coca Cola pyjamas in store of which i had my eye on  sadly could not afford at the time. Just passing by to pick up some things for the weekend and noticed them in the sale  but sadly they were on their own with no matching top. I wasn t really fussed about the top - I just wanted the bottoms (and I think my partner wants me to have them too  simply so I ll stop wearing his!!) and took them to customer services to ask them how much they were. The lady seemed very unenthusiastic  and proceeded to tell me she couldn t and wouldn t sell me them  despite my asking how much they were. She mumbled something about policy and swiftly turned me away with no resolution. Very disappointed. I really really wanted them too! Would have paid for the entire set just for the bottoms had she given me the chance. Gutted. Any way I can still get them???

In Nov 2014 my son who is disabled was given a hudl 2 for his birthday by my parents. The hudl as I have discovered this morning is not working. I called your customer service and the lovely and very understanding Brandon tried to get the hudl to reboot and start working again  however no matter what we tried it didn t work. He told me that he would have to send me out a package to send it to be repaired. Which wasn t a problem until I told him as it was a gift from my parents 14 months ago for his birthday I didn t have the receipt. He politely asked if I could ask them to go threw their bank statements to try and find it.... However they are on the holiday of a life time in Australia so won t be back for 6 weeks  I explained how upset my little boy is and asked if he could ask his manager to make an exception due to his disabilities and the fact that my parents are away and I didn t really want my son to have to wait that long. (That s if they could find it at all). Well the manager refused to help me stated I had to get the proof of purchase or they wouldn t do anything!!!! So I m asking tesco would u like to explain to him why his hudl can t be fixed?? (A technical issue nothing he did to his prize possession). When if it had been an ipad or a Samsung I could have just walked into a store or booked an appointment and they would fix it no questions asked! My 8 year old didn t cause the faults so why shouldn t you fix them.... I am now off to explain to the little boy who hasn t stopped crying since he came in from school and I couldn t fix it. Thank you so much to your call centre employee who was utterly lovely and totally agreed with everything I said. And thank you tesco for making me realise what a fantastic company you are.... (massive sarcastic overtone!)					2016-01-29T17:51:05+0000	1454089865	2016-01-29 18:51:05	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sadly it was out of stock  but I saw a member of your staff and asked if he would be willing to check if there was any out back. I didn t realise that your Colleague was clocked out as he bent over backwards to help me out and even after I realised he wasn t clocked in at that time he still tried to help me. GREAT Service from this colleague.

YOUR update killed my hudl2 and now you want ¬£59 to look at it. that s half of the price of the machine... what s the hourly rate on that service... I m glad You don t sell cars  you would be giving people dodgy parts and then charging them when they came back with the fault. Personally I m disgusted at your method of avoiding repairing the damage the forced update did to my device  You don t even give any recovery options. Oh Wait. its because I don t have the receipt from getting it when I was just out of hospital with my back and shoulder broken. Only You Make them. It doesn t matter if other people sell them second hand... YOU RIP OFF!					2016-01-29T13:27:52+0000	1454074072	2016-01-29 14:27:52	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What a sarcastic woman I had the pleasure of speaking with!  Tesco  I would never buy a Hudl again  and I certainly would never buy anything electrical from you either if that s the type of customer service I would receive.   Xmas 2014 my daughter got her Hudl2  in January it made a very loud high pitch screech (scaring the life out of my 6 year old) then it died.  would charge or turn on.  Went into the store and they swapped it straight away.  Less than a year later the same thing happened  this time I had to send it back for testing - I then got a reconditioned one sent back (with no explanation).  I knew it was reconditioned because the charge port was wobbly! Now  I charge the Hudl2 on the night time  by the time my daughter wants to use it in the morning the battery has died on the Hudl2 has switched itself off. I call customer services and have been told that i have to wait 3-5 days for a call back.  I ask a call back for what  and apparently its to tell me whether you ll do anything about it or not.  Just great!  Every little helps does it????					2016-01-29T13:16:02+0000	1454073362	2016-01-29 14:16:02	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a premier pet insurance on the 20th January and have just received my documents. There s no mention anywhere of the 4 000 clubcard points  and I was just wondering if there was any way to find out if I will be receiving them. I entered the TOPPET code when buying but it said  not valid  but further down the page it did state it included the points. Thank you :)					2016-01-29T13:15:00+0000	1454073300	2016-01-29 14:15:00	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You said to return the hair  packaging and receipt to any store and I will receive a refund and it will be sent away and I shall hear back within 2 weeks. I did return everything that you asked. I returned it to a store I normally don t shop in. The manager had no idea what I was talking about and had to take a picture of the reply that you had said to me. Tomorrow is 2 weeks and I have little faith that the manager actually sent it away. Please can you let me know what is going on with the situation please.

I thought I d leave some comments here as the manager I spoke to didn t seem to  be taking me seriously. This morning at the Exe Vale Extra store in Exeter there was a fire evacuation. The public announcement on the store speaker system could not be heard over the alarms. Customers were herded out the door as you would expect but then: We were left milling around outside the entrance while staff trooped off to the assembly point across the car park. At no time did I hear anyone taking charge and issuing instructions to the public. There was no fire marshal in evidence. I overheard two members of staff saying  what about the customers? should they come with us  while the other one said  It s up to them. It s their lookout .  While the general staff were across the car park the store was  guarded  by the management (identified by their suits). They did not leave the building. As a firewarden myself I was less than impressed.					2016-01-29T09:52:17+0000	1454061137	2016-01-29 10:52:17	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I drink a lot of Innocent fruit juice but can t seem to find the 900ml bottles on the shelves in any store  just the 1.35 litre bottles. Do you no longer do them?  I prefer the smaller bottle because they fit better in a standard fridge (and they don t fit in your reuseable cardboard bottle holders so I need to use more plastic bags and those bigger bottles are very heavy and your bags aren t that strong).					2016-01-28T21:36:56+0000	1454017016	2016-01-28 22:36:56	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Quorn have recognised the increasing call from vegans for their product to become vegan. They have answered this by producing  many items in their range as suitable for vegans. Sadly  Tesco  you do not stock these.   I would like to highlight to you that anyone eating an omnivorous or vegetarian diet can enjoy vegan quote therefore you would not be excluding any of your existing on I and veggie customers but what you WOULD do is INCREASE your customer base by making more available for vegans.   Please have a think about this and let me know when you intend to roll out vegan quorn to your stores.					2016-01-28T17:41:01+0000	1454002861	2016-01-28 18:41:01	5	2	5	0	7	2	1	1	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Considering the tokens are valid from 8th January til 29th February I think it s a bit unfair as my children were looking forward to a cinema trip to see this film.

I asked the member of staff if they could call Cirencester extra to see if they had in stock but the gentleman told me that they don t have any contact with any other stores (something I found abit strange being a tesco employee myself this didn t sound right) and the conversation was left at that no offer to try and help any other way not even the telephone number for the Cirencester store. As I m sure you can understand I m already pretty displeased with the service I had received. LUCKILY enough for me Cirencester had the game in stock and they couldn t have been more polite  whilst there; purely out of curiosity I asked if stores contact each other regarding customer queries to do with stock and was told of course we do on a regular basis and that even if we couldn t for any reason there are other ways of checking stock levels in other stores using some sort off app. Story over but in short although I am an employee of tesco today I was a customer  a highly dissatisfied customer when I enter a tesco store I expect to be treated with respect and made to feel important (points I regularly practice whilst at work) however on this occasion things couldn t be further from the truth  this isn t about the fact the store didn t have the game I wanted on stock or that I had to drive 20 or so miles it s the fact that when I come to a tesco store I do NOT expect to be lied to. I do in fact expect to receive the best customer service possible  I would almost be tempted to let it slide of there had been a big que but no; I was the only person in line yet felt the customer assistant had far more important things to be getting on with. I do live just a stones throw away from asda and although we receive employee discount  the fuel costs of travelling to Swindon extra actually cancel each other out. This isn t the first time i have had problems with swindon s tech/game department either however today really angered me and caused completely unnecessary stress.   Yours sincerely   A very disappointed customer.					2016-01-28T14:45:55+0000	1453992355	2016-01-28 15:45:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bit into the sandwich which had the most disgusting smell and taste. I believe the prawns were off even though the sandwich was still in date. I will not be purchasing this sandwich again.					2016-01-28T13:55:08+0000	1453989308	2016-01-28 14:55:08	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Since it has changed to Avios I feel it really is not worth collecting them anymore  especially if you live in the North of England. Most flights (especially to Europe) are from London!  So extra cost there to get to London.  Choices of destinations have reduced.  I don t feel I get good value anymore and with airmiles I could pay for the whole thing with my points but with Avios still have to pay towards it with money.  I have spent 3 hours this morning trying to get a holiday in November to Germany (Cologne) with one of the agents and failed yet again to come up with anything.  Feeling very frustrated.  Definitley not collecting avios any more as its not worth it.					2016-01-28T13:03:14+0000	1453986194	2016-01-28 14:03:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was regarding the fitbit s charge HR small size  the coloured ones were all out of stock and as soon as they came back in stock they were increased by ¬£20. I m sure it breached an advertising law and was very misleading and could be deemed as false advertising. I m sure I m not the only shocked customer who had been waiting for the stock to return to purchase and had registered my interest using your stock alert system - it seems a bit of a scam to get all those waiting for the stock to pay a higher price!

She s used it only half a dozen times and is having nothing but trouble with it. The only way it stays on is if you keep it on charge  if it s off charge it just randomly turns itself off and then takes us a good half an hour or more to turn back on. Charged fully last night and by accident took it from the charger this morning and now it won t turn on at all.

I went shopping with my partner to Hampton Tesco  armed with a ¬£25 Visa giftcard. Once we had finished our shopping  we wandered off to the checkouts to pay. I handed over my Visa giftcard  and waited for the money to be taken off of my bill. The cashier tried a couple of times to swipe the card  with no luck  even scanned the barcode which of course resulted in ¬£27 being added! That was quickly removed! She then gave up and said  nope  not working.  She didnt call over a team leader for advice  nothing! Anyway  i have had to spend my Clubcard vouchers which i was saving to buy holiday clothes for! After going to Customer Services to speak to someone regarding this  we were told that you do infact accept these giftcards (which i knew already as i used to work for Tesco  and my sister still does).

How long do you think it s an acceptable amount of time to hold on to my money without sending a refund?  I ordered and item on line. I paid. Then I get an email saying item was not in stock. That was on 17th Dec 2015. Still have got my money back and according to an email received yesterday you ve only just had the return back..... how? You never sent it! 2. For the last few months I have been buying tesco finest bacon at the special offer of buy 2 for ¬£5 .... gutted to see the offer has finished.... no wait. It s now ¬£2.50 per pack.... so it hasn t been on offer at all ... you ve just fooled me into buying more and why put 4 pack baked beans on special offer... spend time putting the yellow sale ticket on the shelf to falsely attract the buyers eye... when Infact it s more expensive to buy them in that format... buy a 6 pack and it s cheaper and they aren t on special offer!

After being covered in oil water and my little trip to the ground I spoke with customer services  and they were quick and attentive to deal with the situation. The lady at the customer service desk (I think pam?) was amazing! She truly looked after me  getting my coat dried cleaned  providing me with another and doing anything she could to ensure I was ok.  Drain was promptly covered but my main concern was for others safety  what if it wasn t me  a child or an OAP that went down it. Yeah I m a little sore  but others could of seriously damaged themselves.  Apart from the fantastic customer service I received  it has raised my concerns of future problems that may arise from bad weather. Due care and attention is a must in the car park.   Thank you to your staff! I definitely was the talk of the store when I left!					2016-01-27T18:34:53+0000	1453919693	2016-01-27 19:34:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A phone call was made and the phone passed over to me and I was told Tracy Island is not in stock and is discontinued  and I quote   what do you expect me to do  magic one up for you?!  Yet if I click the link in my order confirmation email I am taken to your website where I am invited to buy it for ¬£64.99... Hmmm!!

My son just had a fall in one of your stores. The staff were extremely helpful so my concern have nothing to do with them. However there were no trained first aiders. The first aid box wasn t fully stocked for example I noticed that there was no eye wash or wet wipes  and it was a wet wipe it needed to clean up the blood.					2016-01-27T16:05:39+0000	1453910739	2016-01-27 17:05:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When we took the items back to the store to seek advice or refund should it be a fault with the tablet  i was met at the electronics desk by a very dismissive young man who refused to listen to my problem and only pointed out a number to ring. Upon ringing the number i spoke to another dismissive man who simply stated he doesnt really know about tablets nor are the staff instore. i am going round in circles and no one will give me advice or a refund. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that people use proper technology stores to buy there products so they may receive usefull advice if it is needed					2016-01-27T15:31:33+0000	1453908693	2016-01-27 16:31:33	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The labeling on this product says 100% of profits is donated to their charity.  I find this very misleading as you don t explicitly say how much per egg will be donated and it s left very much in the hands of your accountants to determine how much  profit  you make.  Could you let me know exactly how much profit you make on these eggs and therefore how much will be donated to charity.   Or if it s simpler  what is the cost to you to sell these eggs  to take into account the discounting that will take place after Easter?

I received a text saying the sofa would be delivered between 12.45-2.45pm. That came and went  I was told the sofa was stuck in picking at the warehouse and therefore wasn t loaded onto the van. A few days later and I m given a delivery slot for today between 9-11am. I called Arrow XL to check it was on its way  only to be told that the sofa has been de-located (what?!) and again isn t out for delivery. And so it continues!   Tesco  please stop using this company  their reviews are shocking (see their fb page) and as a customer  it makes me reluctant to use Tesco Direct again as the whole experience has been a shambles.  The only saving grace has been your Customer Service team  who have so far been very helpful in trying to reach a resolution.

We were looking online for laptops for my wife and had considered popping in to our local Tesco.  We won t be popping in now.  If you have jobs that need doing pay a living wage.					2016-01-27T07:03:46+0000	1453878226	2016-01-27 08:03:46	1	9	1	0	10	9	8	1	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

She told me that I needed to clean it even if I just cleaned the number plate itself as I could be fined ¬£100...I had no idea of this. I thanked her and said I d do it once I d got home. She then asked me if I wanted some blue roll...again...I thanked her and accepted...she then said she would put some water on it for me. Then...as if all that wasn t enough...she said... come on...I ll wipe it down for you  I practically begged and pleaded with her to stay in the store. She insisted and went straight to my car and cleaned the number plate down. I was unable to see her name on her badge as I only thought to look as we were outside in the relative dark. I cannot thank her enough and will be going back tomorrow to find out her name to thank her properly. I just wanted to say thank you to her on here and to thank you for employing such a lovely caring and conscientious person. She went way above and beyond good customer service. This was at a small ish tesco at Bluebell Garage  Acklam in Middlesbrough.					2016-01-27T01:13:32+0000	1453857212	2016-01-27 02:13:32	27	5	27	0	32	5	2	3	2	0	26	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am vegan and I am writing to request that you do not coat your fruit and vegetables with animal products such as shellac  beeswax  chitosan  casein and such like.  300 000 creatures die in the production of just one kilo of shellac  this is cruel and unnecessary.   In the meantime  please clearly label all coated products as not suitable for vegtarians/vegans. I look forward to hearing back on this matter.					2016-01-27T01:01:11+0000	1453856471	2016-01-27 02:01:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is now 11:45pm and still nothing. If it s not coming  a text message saying so would be greatly appreciated.

So I was surprised at 9:20pm this evening when my door buzzer went and one of your delivery drivers wanted to deliver to my flat. This woke my baby up. My husband told him it wasn t for us and put the phone down. Again the guy buzzed for longer this time until again my husband told him it was the wrong flat. A third time was a step too far. So I went down and told him to stop ringing our buzzer the man was very rude and insistent that the order was for us. He said how could he do his job if we wouldn t let him in. He argued with me and wouldn t Believe he had it wrong. When he eventually checked his paperwork it was for different number. I understand mistakes happen but three times he was told and he wouldn t listen and was rude to me my baby has only just resettled at 9:50pm after being rudely awoken.

Please don t come back to me stating that you support British dairy farmers and pay a premium  when if fact you pay a premium to a few hundred producers to cover your backsides! We work an average of fifteen hours a DAY producing quality milk in a system where are cows are kept on a high welfare  farm assured environment - can the same be said from the cheap foreign milk you import! British farming has to meet high welfare standards to be able to sell  can you tell me what standards are met on foreign milk and dairy products?

My husband didn t realise until we d made all the breakfasts including my two young children s cereal.  So my porridge  husbands cereal  children s cereal had to be all thrown away  alongside our cup of tea and coffee.  Now this has happened once before  but then we just poured it down the drain and thought it was a one off.  This time we took it to our local tesco store to be told they d let Cravendale know of the problem  and we could get another bottle as a replacement.  To be honest  I don t think this is acceptable.  We had to throw away so much food this morning  that cost us our money  to then have to eat something else  another cost.  If your company is selling this product (a long life milk) then it should be fresh enough  and if it isn t then you need to think how you compensate customers for their inconvenience and costs for food wasted.					2016-01-26T19:55:33+0000	1453838133	2016-01-26 20:55:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Especially if she has no black clothes. And if you have no black clothes  except for a sexy black silky neglig√© which would be way too weird for Daddy in the audience.   Don t despair! If you feel like screaming  noooooo!   simply abandon dinner  throw children in the car and drive to Riverhead Tesco  where the very lovely Ad√®le from Tesco clothing will sort you out.   Even if there are no black clothes to be found. Seriously. She will have a rummage in the stockroom until she finds your eleven year old something wearable. She will look in the sales stuff buried under piles of last season s wear  she will find you a black adult size 6 jumper and the blackest child s skirt that they have. She will look in the stuff so new that it doesn t have a tag yet and isn t on the system. She may save your bacon. She saved ours. And Daddy s blushes...   Thank you  fabulous Tesco clothing lady.  We think that are wonderful.   (She is not related to me  my partner or my friend on Facebook. Yet.)					2016-01-26T19:55:09+0000	1453838109	2016-01-26 20:55:09	9	7	9	0	16	7	3	4	2	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

Such fines should personally hurt the directors in their pockets.					2016-01-26T18:45:18+0000	1453833918	2016-01-26 19:45:18	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It stands to reason that they receive immediate payment by their customers so why should they not pay their suppliers immediately as well?

All so you can pay less for it and presumably devalue British milk still further or increase margin so you can pay your massive fines    When is tesco going to ensure ALL its liquid Milk is bought at a fair price that allows farmers to make a living   not a loss  not just TSDG producers?  Unless you start paying a fair price very soon  there won t be a dairy industry left to supply you with milk?   You keep saying you Pay a fair price to your farmers. This makes the public think you mean all milk not just TSDG. So what percentage of your liquid milk is supplied by tsdg  and what percentage is bought from elsewhere?   I live yards from one of your Extra stores  but rest assured we will be using online shopping from another supplier until you sort this out  even if their milk does cost a few pence more  at least they support British farming more than Tesco.					2016-01-26T16:54:12+0000	1453827252	2016-01-26 17:54:12	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Driver can t find address  calls me but I don t answer as I m breastfeeding my 11weeks old upstairs. I phone back 7mins later to be told he can t come now and I will need to ring a number  I refuse this as my two year old isn t happy and my newborn has woken up. Finally get a call over an hour later to be told it going to be delivered between 6-7 Bath and bedtime for my two boys. To add salt to the wound dinner is in that shop as is milk for bedtime and bedtime nappies. Safe to say I will be going back to Sainsburys at least they have the ability to google maps the address like anyone else would!					2016-01-26T15:58:10+0000	1453823890	2016-01-26 16:58:10	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought some tobacco from you Arbroath store today (as most times I was never given a receipt) couple of hours later I open the packet to find out its completely dry (also something I have encountered from your store before a couple of times) so I ve gone out my way (1 Mile round trip drive) to go and have it replaced at the store. Get there and there s none left of the tobacco I smoke  which is understandable... Without even being asked if I wanted another brand of tobacco they decided that I will get what s given to me. I told them I don t smoke no other tobacco and would like a refund so I could go and get it from another store. Then was told I couldn t have that because I didn t have a receipt.. So I explain to the staff that I never received one so how can ever get it back to them if I ve never had it in the first place.. I was told they can t refund it if there s no receipt  like it s my fault!? was pretty much told  your going to either take the original packet from tobacco back or pick something else... this has left me so angry at your so called  service   I m not in the wrong  I have come as a customer to buy a product that in the end I wasn t happy about. I would expect for this issue to be resolved one way or another... not for me to be fobbed off with  the next best thing  I made it very clear that I didn t smoke other brands for personal reasons. But this obviously wasn t a good enough excuse for the member of staff that dealt with this situation.. I ended up feeling so uncomfortable with he situation I just picked one to get out the store. This is the last time I will be using your store and will be making sure my friends and family do the exact same.. I would like you to contact me asap by my email: scotsproducer@gmail.com about this situation as I won t stop until you have contacted me.					2016-01-26T15:52:18+0000	1453823538	2016-01-26 16:52:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went into your store to purchase an iPad charger. Found my product and proceeded to the self-service checkout. Then I was served by the lovely Hannah a young  small girl with blonde hair. She was awesome! Full of smiles and had a bubbly personality. She spoke to me like a long lost friend. I thanked her and left the store. Unfortunately the product didn t fit. Phoned up customer services who again where fantastic and told me to go back into store with my receipt. Went back into store for the refund. The whole team where lovely! Including another manager called Hannah  luke on the phone shop and Dominic? I had to go elsewhere for my item but the service was unbelievable. Please give a massive thank you and give the team a reward! I don t want them to receive a pat on the back but a really worthy prize! I ll be shopping next week and will check up to see if they have received anything. I was touched by their kindness and customer service!

The Grocery Code Adjudicator has ruled that the retailer has deliberately delayed payments to suppliers to enhance profits. As if things weren t bad enough there already  what with the looming inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office into accounting irregularities that could mean swingeing fines. The regulator wants changes to prevent further breaches of the code. Tesco has admitted its guilt. Will this be followed by outraged customers boycotting the stores in protest against this bullying of suppliers  many of them small firms which can ill afford to upset our biggest grocer? 					2016-01-26T14:32:21+0000	1453818741	2016-01-26 15:32:21	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve now been told by a fairly abrupt phone operative that my 10am delivery will be here between 7-8pm. If you can t manage to deliver in the time slots then why offer them?

They are removing 200m litres of milk from Arla  a farmer owned co-op and are giving that quantity to independently owned Muller.  This means 200m litres of milk is destined for Westbury at a farm gate price of around 16ppl.  In Farmers For Action s view this is totally irresponsible of Tesco were operating a 50/50 share between the two companies.  We feel this has been done at a time when the dairy industry is facing some of its darkest hours.   In response  Tesco will obviously say  which will be correct  they are still paying a COP figure to all their producers and we support that  but this  has decimated the rest of the liquid dairy sector.  Whilst this is happening  we understand from various sources that Muller are offering liquid milk at discounted prices to try and get business away from Arla.   Since posting last night this revelation  we now understand that an individual employed by Tesco has said the decision has not yet been finalised.  We find this very interesting especially on the day when Tesco have been found guilty by the Grocery Code Adjudicator of bad practice.  So we say to you Tesco  if you want to avoid thousands of farmers coming to your stores to tell the consumer  shutting down your distribution centres  you need to reinstate a farmer owner co-op as your 50% supplier on liquid milk.  If not  a fight you will have  the rest of us have got nothing to lose.  Your actions will impact on all but your own selected bunch of dairy producers.  We are not prepared to sit back and accept what you are doing.  You can issue Writs  threaten legal action  you can do what you like because we are about to fight to stop our industry being destroyed by you  a major retailer.					2016-01-26T12:41:58+0000	1453812118	2016-01-26 13:41:58	4	4	4	1	9	4	4	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am also informed that the support shall not be available as I don t have my receipt from a couple of years ago... Only Tesco sell the  Tesco HUDL  so It was definately bought from you. what if it was a Christmas present? No Support I guess... Absolutely Disgusted by this!

Usually 10% or so off a ¬£40 shop. Now all of the vouchers require an ¬£80 shop. Sorry but this month I will be shopping elsewhere.  Also I shop online for my mother in law who lives in Budapest in Hungary but though Tesco are happy to take my English money in payment I am unable to use my English vouchers to discount these monthly shops!  A couple of small things that Customer Services could rectify quite easily!					2016-01-26T12:29:06+0000	1453811346	2016-01-26 13:29:06	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I spoke to customer services via the freephone number and the manager was very helpful  she sent a replacement outfit to the store and offered some credit back for the mistake in which happened their end.

After booking a slot for grocery delivery for 9-10am this morning  my order didn‚Äôt arrive. I called your customer service number and they explained there was a fault on your website that caused this. There was no notification that my order had not gone through or that there might be problems with grocery orders. Now all your delivery slots are full for other times in the day as are other supermarkets delivery slots and I have missed the window to rebook a delivery for today due to the delay you caused. I would have thought that as the fault is with you that you would make arrangements to honour the deliveries on the requested day.					2016-01-26T12:02:53+0000	1453809773	2016-01-26 13:02:53	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in last night and bought two tvs and I experienced absolutely outstanding customer service! The first young lady I approached (at 10pm) was so kind and helpful  the young lad at the checkout who said I could leave my trolley of shopping with him so I could go with the manager to get my tvs was a star  the manager was so helpful and patient while I sorted out my choice of tvs  the guy stacking the produce who carried one of them for me  the lady who emptied her cage so we could fit the two tvs on it to take to the car and finally the manager was absolutely amazing! Excellent service in store then he took the tvs out to my car  folded down the seats and put them in for me! That store has singlehandedly restored my faith in Tesco. Unfortunately I ve become accustomed to pretty poor customer service in other stores (maybe I ve just been unlucky) but last night they made it effortless for me and I left the store a very happy lady. The only downside is this is not my local extra store so I m unlikely to be in again in the near future. Please pass on a massive thank you to them all. As I said it was genuinely outstanding.					2016-01-26T10:09:37+0000	1453802977	2016-01-26 11:09:37	0	2	0	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Could you enlighten me why all the packs of Capri sun and Ribena are ALL sugar free at your Leyland store. Don t get me wrong I m all for getting people healthier but as a type one diabetic of 22 years  I often rely on them drinks to help me out when having a hypo. You re the only store that seems to have completely got rid of all the packs containing sugar. Where s the freedom of choice?					2016-01-25T22:02:42+0000	1453759362	2016-01-25 23:02:42	2	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I used to hold Tesco in high regard but after my click and collect experience in November where it took 8 days to deliver my order to my local store and I never even got as much as an apology which is customer service of the lowest level  my opinion of Tesco now is l will ALWAYS shop elsewhere except when I have no choice as in when the item I want is much cheaper and that s it. Doubt if I will get a reply but if I do I guess it will be a scripted corporate reply  or will you prove me wrong?

As we all know today is Burns Night  and  like many other people across the UK  I felt the need to celebrate this most Scottish of days by enjoying a big delicious Haggis. Now you must forgive me for not planning ahead  however  when I attempted to purchase a singular Haggis from your Tesco Metro store in Falmouth  Cornwall you can imagine my disappointment and grief to find they were not on sale at all!  I find this to be bordering on discrimination and I hope there is a suitable explanation for this outrage.  Yours hangrily Joseph Wollaston					2016-01-25T20:54:32+0000	1453755272	2016-01-25 21:54:32	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And the vegetarian section appears to be the first to be reduced when you need space for something else.  Are we Vegetarians so unacceptable to you?  At least where you have a high density of stores  like around the London / Tower bridge area you could try to cater for us.  Not all of us want  or have the ability  to get to the large stores without going well out of our way ( nor do we want to pay extra for a delivery of one or 2 items  or click and collect from a store even further out of our way!).  I did manage to get them back into one store  but a few weeks later  your high and mighty central decisions team take them away again.  The vegetarian Lincolnshire sausages are the best you do.  Get a life and sort it. :( :( :(  Your slogan should be very little help not what you use.					2016-01-25T20:46:52+0000	1453754812	2016-01-25 21:46:52	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our item was lost but then all of a sudden it said failed attempt to deliver which was a load of rubbish as the store was open and they get there deliveries at regular times and the store said there is no way they tried to deliver it so were telling lies so cancelled it as was going to take another 5 to 10 days for replacement plus the same for a refund terrible service not aceptable.					2016-01-25T18:15:26+0000	1453745726	2016-01-25 19:15:26	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I had paid I expected to have to struggle back to my car with baby and shopping  the lady signed off her till grabbed my shopping and carried it to my car waiting patiently whilst i strapped the baby in  what fantastic customer service I was shown today by both ladies.					2016-01-25T18:11:19+0000	1453745479	2016-01-25 19:11:19	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have NEVER EVER smelt anything like it in my life  it is nose scarring and vomit inducing! Your poor staff working there are having to work in this dreadful environment let alone how unhygienic this is in AA store selling fresh produce.

Annoyingly he bought (and subsequently at with his friends) with 6 Tesco Big Night In pizzas.....costing ¬£4 each. Why o Why did the person at the checkout not tell him instead of paying ¬£24 for 6 pizzas he should have only paid ¬£18 for 6 pizzas and 6 sides.....??? Customer service seems to be lacking.....as much as his common sense....!!!!					2016-01-25T17:48:21+0000	1453744101	2016-01-25 18:48:21	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  yesterday my partner went at about 3.45 and was refused a trolley by one of the staff as it was close to closing time. We had quite a lot of things to buy and he was there well before closing time. Later my husband then saw the staff member who refused the trolley walking inside the store and overheard another staff member complaining that he was supposed to be stopping CUSTOMERS getting trolleys  you know customers the people who pay your wages!  We are aware of the closing time  which is why we got there with plenty of time to do some shopping    This is a poor policy  especially if a customer is unable to lift the basket easily. My husband managed to get most of the things he needed but even found the basket heavy.					2016-01-25T16:59:14+0000	1453741154	2016-01-25 17:59:14	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought it was a bit steep so I walked round to look at the collective display of other brands... there on the shelf the same Tesco one priced at ¬£17.50....so I take it to the barcode price checker and it says ¬£17! Which is what I paid at the till..... Fantastic bargin for me....I am very pleased with my purchase......but felt maybe more would sell if priced correctly...so I felt compelled to say something....what a waste of time.....cashier said don t tell them something like that when it s cheaper than marked....so told the lady overseeing the tills....she didn t seem that interested either?

I can confirm I never used such a card as there was none so I would like to know the next step is to avail of this ver thoughtful purchase from my colleagues. I m sure you can appreciate that this is a lot of money & I can tell you that as a customer of tesco if I get no satisfaction I will not bd shopping in Tesco any longer!!! i say this as all other avenues weren the helpful. if you would like to know what loss of business this to Tesco then I ll  let you know   at the end of each year I receive vouchers totalling around‚Ç¨80/‚Ç¨90...... I await a response. just to mention I have confirmation in a paper receipt. Regards Breege					2016-01-25T10:46:42+0000	1453718802	2016-01-25 11:46:42	0	14	0	0	14	14	3	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So  during my morning route to work  I got stuck behind a Tesco home delivery van  nothing wrong with his driving.  However  what took me by shock and disgust was the fact that after a while  near my work destination  something hit my jacket that had come out of the drivers window.  Not being phased by it  I carried on my way to work  after I took my motorbike jacket off  I inspected where I got hit and to my surprise it was a mouth full of spit sitting on my jacket.  This is vile and disgusting!  I did take the drivers Reg down as AV63 YJN.  I‚Äôm horrified by this.					2016-01-25T09:16:35+0000	1453713395	2016-01-25 10:16:35	2	6	2	0	8	6	2	4	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went into your Kingsway Dundee Extra store tonight to purchase new Laptops for myself and my wife. After looking at all available on the shelves we both chose one. We took the display boxes up to the desk and the assistant went to retrieve them. He came back a short time later saying that you were out of stock on these but tried to sell us some that were over ¬£100 dearer. If i wanted them i would of chosen them!!!!! the stock boxes on display numbered 12 so anyone would assume you had 12 in stock. There was no indication that there was no stock and we were very dissapointed in that. Surely if you dont have them the shelf should have been empty and an out of stock sticker put in place. We left the store disheartened and unhappy. We then went to ASDA and purchased the laptops we were looking at for a slightly higher price but at least they had them there. I now will never buy technology from your stores as we do not wish to be dissillusioned again. NOT HAPPY!!!					2016-01-25T02:33:14+0000	1453689194	2016-01-25 03:33:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These ready meals contain too much added salt and saturated fats. These could easily be reduced. However  you are giving people the impression that you do not care about the quality of food you sell and are neglecting your responsibilities to help people choose and eat healthier products. I really would expect more from one of the major food retailers.					2016-01-24T21:59:04+0000	1453672744	2016-01-24 22:59:04	1	5	1	1	7	5	4	1	21	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

On two recent deliveries the eggs I purchased had already gone off so today s delivery I chose eggs that were not tesco own but once again there is a problem! I just went to put them away and looked at the date. The box clearly states display until 19/1/16 but that was 5 days ago!! And then the best before date is 26/1/16 really helpful  not!! Called tesco but sat on the line over 10 minutes without anyone answering. What is going on with tesco? If I cannot reliably buy ALL my groceries and after a delivery I still have to use up petrol to drive to get basics  why am I paying delivery charges for the delivery? Tesco  you are too big to make these mistakes!					2016-01-24T20:25:21+0000	1453667121	2016-01-24 21:25:21	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And no that isn t a typo.   Compliment part : May I just say its nice to see your policy of removing unhealthy snacks from your tills at Petrol Station Expresses. Even as far as Lochgilphead in the far reaches of west Scotland. So before my drive down after a weekend away I picked up some tasty banana chips and  Soft Apricots  for the journey. Both were delicious and refreshing in the fact that as opposed to my usual motorway snacks didn t leave me feeling especially guilty after consuming kilos of chocolate mindlessly.   Complain part (not that bad really.) : I do however feel somewhat hard done by re: the large bag of soft apricots was indeed excellent value for money  but being such a large bag and driving the 6 and a bit hours to Manchester I munched all the way through them. It s only after gorging on said product that I realised o had probably just consumed the equivalent of 6 punnets of apricots and the associated fibre. So didn t actually manage to own the product for the entire duration of my journey if you get my drift.   I suppose the message of this tale is perhaps you could offer the product in smaller packets at the tills to prevent other people suffering as I did!					2016-01-24T19:05:20+0000	1453662320	2016-01-24 20:05:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just want to commend the staff on customer services  they were fab. They refunded me immediately and also replaced the chicken with a fresh on  (which I didn t expect).

My delivery was delayed due to a tyre blow out and when it arrived the driver was incredibly apologetic (these things happen no fault of his) and so because of this his deliveries were running later than planned. Despite this  the wonderful driver brought in all the crates for me because my husband who normally carries it all through is at work. I expected to be rushed to empty them but i couldn t have been more wrong! The driver very kindly emptied the crates for me and put the groceries on the counter as I had my 2 small children with me who were eating their dinners. He then went through my bill while his colleague loaded the crates back in the trucks.   I used to use Asda but decided to try Tesco and after today I will never look back. I have never known a grocery delivery driver be so thoughtful  helpful and above all patient despite running a bit late. Thank you Tesco for employing such a gem of a man!! Please can he deliver all my online orders lol :-)   P.S. His name is Kane and his colleague is Billy the van number on my receipt is 9B/2890					2016-01-24T15:09:55+0000	1453648195	2016-01-24 16:09:55	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Maybe you have those new vans with magic indicators that blink so fast we just don t see them.........luckily for your van driver  he heard the horn that comes as standard in most vehicles today.   Have a word please Tesco because when they just stop in the middle of the road without warning it kind of gets dangerous for us decent drivers!					2016-01-24T13:46:45+0000	1453643205	2016-01-24 14:46:45	0	5	0	1	6	5	3	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Staff standing in groups nattering  younger members of staff walking through the veg section swearing  stock rotation that is appalling - had to take half the stock off the shelf so I could buy items with a sell by date that wasn t yesterday. Got to the till  no hope of scan and shop this week as I wanted to use some gift cards that have to be swiped and signed. Tesco sell these gift cards but it would appear they don t recognise them as legal tender  highly embarrassing when the person behind comments oh look her cards been refused  ¬£50 of cards that I couldn t use  was taken to another till by the supervisor and he couldn t get them through either  good job I m not on a restricted budget like some customers. We purchased some reduced flea collars for the cats as the packaging was damaged  went to use them last night but can t as the use by date is April 2014  yes just short of 2 years out of date  chemicals do have a shelf life and could be extremely dangerous outside these dates. Was looking forward to a bacon sandwich this morning using the bacon I purchased yesterday  couldn t use the bacon as it has no use by dates on the packaging  I thought it was illegal for products not to have use by dates					2016-01-24T13:41:01+0000	1453642861	2016-01-24 14:41:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wanted to let you know that for the past month I have been paying for carrier bags on my online food shop and only receiving a couple each shop much less than what I should get when paying 40p per shop and half of my shopping arrives loose!   Additionally today my 2 boxes of eggs arrived broken and smeared all over the shopping (again most of it was loose!) so I now have to wipe down every item before putting it away!

I take a wander down the road as not far from home - yes! They have one in stock...but it s ¬£10 dearer. I ask if they can do something about the price:  No  we don t price match online.  Fair enough  but now I m going to go home  order from Tesco Direct  to be delivered FREE to store. What about the logistics involved  carbon footprint ring any bells?!

Being one of only two packs remaining  and wanting Pancakes for breakfast tomorrow  we took them to checkout  where we were told they (obviously) couldn t be sold to us and that they would have to be sent to waste - rather than simply being given to us  OR BETTER STILL  being put in the food bank at the door...   So  in short  a little disgusted - not with the staff member who seemed very apologetic about the situation  but more with the company policy on the whole situation. It s not as though the product was inedible simply because it had an M&S logo on it! There s more than enough food waste from supermarkets without putting perfectly good stuff in the bin..					2016-01-23T19:03:29+0000	1453575809	2016-01-23 20:03:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My Daughter was sick in the trolley and my Husband went and got a Manager to say there was some on the floor and the Manager could not do enough to help us. He gave my daughter a bottle of water and then gave us tissues to clear ourselves up and then asked if there was anything else we needed. He was lovely and so so helpful so a big thank you to that man.					2016-01-23T18:53:09+0000	1453575189	2016-01-23 19:53:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Here s a tip don t sell stuff online you don t stock in store  wasting people s time is not nice and having to leave the store without my item is more than a bit annoying I could have had a refund (nice if you to offer to give me my money back) but said refund takes 3 days so I can t rebuy the item elsewhere.

As we approached the bakery my son became upset as there were no pizza swirls.  He really loves tesco s pizza swirls.  A lovely girl called Steph spoke to my son and said that she would make him one whilst we did our shopping.  I was so pleased as it was kind of late.  When he collected  it he was so happy.  Steph is a credit to your Barrhead store.  My son says they taste even better hot.					2016-01-23T16:24:33+0000	1453566273	2016-01-23 17:24:33	341	31	341	11	383	31	24	7	33	0	337	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased 2 ¬£25 itunes vouchers from your Bilton express store back in November for christmas presents. At the time the member of staff was very rude and unhelpful and after asking if an offer was available i was told  they only do the offers at the proper tesco stores  Tesco is above the door so i assume i am going to tesco! Anyway  we have tried to activate the iTunes vouchers  one for my husband and one for a family member to find out one has already been used. We have sent an email to you about this but surprisingly you have not responded. I am sure with all the technology these days you will be able to confirm when the voucher was redeemed and confirm that this was sadly before i even paid ¬£25 for it. I feel like you have robbed my money which disappoints me greatly. I look forward to hearing from you.					2016-01-23T13:26:05+0000	1453555565	2016-01-23 14:26:05	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Lesson learnt always check orginal price!!					2016-01-23T13:10:31+0000	1453554631	2016-01-23 14:10:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I realised before I left the store and went to customer services  where I stood waiting for someone to come to the desk for 20 mins  then explained it to the lady and mentioned the double the difference. She knew nothing of it and would only give me 3.20 back. I would have stayed and argued but my 12 week old baby was screaming the shop down.

As one of the few high street establishments currently offering such an option you have earned the support and gratitude of all those who benefit from the sale of such products due to dietary restrictions  as well as anyone looking to try something new or different. In doing so you have also gained yourselves a distinct sales advantage ahead of your less inclusive competitors by making yourselves accessible to this large and fast-growing market sector. I eagerly await to see what other suitable products may be gracing your shelves in the future. Thank you very much  again  for your provision.  Yours Faithfully   A very grateful customer :)					2016-01-23T11:47:50+0000	1453549670	2016-01-23 12:47:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Obviously we went back to tesco to see if it had been handed in  which we didn t expect it had been  to find a lovely lady called  Mrs Pole   from the Coalville/Ashby area  had handed it in to customer services! My mum was over the moon and the customer services person shouted her over the speaker so we were able to thank her personally. It shows that there are still some good people in the world  if anyone knows of anyone by that name in the area please could you tag her as my mum would like to send her some flowers as a thank you.					2016-01-23T11:29:36+0000	1453548576	2016-01-23 12:29:36	33	8	33	2	43	8	5	3	13	0	33	0	0	0	0	0	0

The machine was not working and there was no staff member around for me to ask for assistance :( so I had to forgo my morning coffee.  I normally use this store as it is on way to work. It seems that that machine is always having issues.  Perhaps I should just use the asda store down the road who s machine is more realiable and have staff members on hand to help.					2016-01-22T23:55:30+0000	1453506930	2016-01-23 00:55:30	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She did not realise the transaction had not gone through. A member of staff ran up to her and accused her of stealing the goods  so my wife is puzzled to why the transaction had not gone through  went back to the till and put them through again. In the meantime the member of staff is shouting to other team members saying she caught a thief. The CCTV will prevail in the morning when I go to the store and talk to the store manager  request a copy. Then my wife will report the incident to the police in the morning. We live around this area and it is quite embarrassing to be honest and my wife is close to tears  we shop in that store at least 3 times a week. And when the member of staff was asked her name  she continued to shout to other members of staff saying ‚ÄúI caught her stealing and now she wants to report me‚Äù. Quite shocking!

I m sure I m not alone in feeling cheesed off with the changes to your direct click and collect service. If you stocked your value pack of toddler pull up pants at my local branch I wouldn t have to specially order them. You ve already increased the price of them by over ¬£1 and now you want to charge an extra ¬£2 on top? You ve also upped the minimum order on the groceries to ¬£15 more than other retailers. I know you re bringing your prices down to match the others but you re screwing us over elsewhere. I know my voice wont change anything but I m really cheesed off with this news.					2016-01-22T20:47:18+0000	1453495638	2016-01-22 21:47:18	1	8	1	0	9	8	6	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

With having a young family I find this much easier than trudging round the store. Today I booked a slot for 1600-1800 so that I can go pick it up while hubby is home with the kids and the app told me to place my order before 1412. At 1358 I clicked checkout to be told my order couldn t be processed and to check my basket. I attempted this again to find my booked slot had disappeared and now there are no slots available until tomorrow! I called your customer services to try to resolve the problem to be told if there are no slots left there is nothing they can do! But I booked a slot???!!! As my next day off is Tuesday and our cupboards are bare  I now have no option but to take a slot tomorrow meaning my husband has to drag the kids out to collect it and eating in to their  boys day  together. Why give customers a time limit to place an order if 14 minutes prior to that cut off point you take the booked slot away?

I have recently broken my shoulder and had shoulder surgery a week ago  because of this I ordered my first online food shop this week.   I booked my slot for 9am-10am this morning. Your chap arrived at 9.05am and has worked like a trooper bringing all my shopping in and rather than just dropping it on the floor and running off  he was helpful  chatty and polite. He helped put my shopping bags in places where it would be easy for me to put away. He asked if I needed anything urgently out of the bags as he would help me fish them out of the many  many bags that I had ordered!   The service was brilliant and will make my life during my recovery a hell of a lot easier. My poor husband doesn t have to scurry round with a 14month old and a one armed bandit around the stores at the weekend! We can now trust this online process.   Just a little thank you and recognition when deserved! I didn t catch the delivery drivers name but it was a morning delivery from coventry. Please try and pass on my thanks.

I was told customers who don t drive complained saying that  is wasnt fair and they d prefer to see discounts/money off etc in store. Now I really benefitted from the petrol points and since they have stopped there has been nothing to compensate for this it can t remember the last time I got a money off voucher other than for online shopping. Also why do I now have to spend ¬£85 online shopping to get ¬£15 discount it was never this much. So annoying.					2016-01-22T09:14:07+0000	1453454047	2016-01-22 10:14:07	1	11	1	0	12	11	3	8	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was wondering if you could consider bringing back the  vegan friendly  shelf labelling you trialled last summer? (I think you may have had it in the chilled area too)  that would amazing!  And in the meantime  if you could improve the indexing/search facility for vegan-friendly products on your website -  that would be great.

Little did we know that we would be finding the love of our life only to have it taken away. Tesco  this is just not on. Your waffles  yes your beautiful BBQ bourbon beef waffles were quite simply stupendous. However  since Christmas we have been suffering major waffle withdrawal and are in dire need of a hit as we are worried we may have to go to rehab if you don t bring these wonderful waffles back into our lives. Please  please  please  for the love of Waffles  save us from a waffleless existence.

I gave toys to my local tesco toy collection and feel very disappointed that they may have not been given out correctly. I m sure even if you were overran with toys this year places like hospital s   hospices and families going through difficult times would have been very greetful for these toys.					2016-01-21T21:51:42+0000	1453413102	2016-01-21 22:51:42	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a pillow last week  the pillow had been treated with some chemicals the smell was so bad it gave me and my partner severe headaches.  I returned the pillow this afternoon only to be met with a very rude customer service person called Margaret! (the other lady sharply found something else to do) so left alone with this person I was told before I even opened my mouth that there was nothing wrong with the pillow period  I went on to explain that it smelt so bad it made me ill and feel sick!  She told me sorry that is the memory foam and that the smell would go away and that I had to leave it to air for 5 days  I explained that it has chemicals that cause health issues only to be told THAT I HAD TO DIE FROM SOMETHING! I told her I wanted a refund and she still kept on  I told her that I would call trading standards only to be told that they would tell me the same thing THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PILLOW! YES THERE IS IT STINKS AND HAS MADE ME ILL! she proceeded to take her time to refund my card and proceeded to tell me as I told her it had made me ill that other customers had also returned the pillows but she had bought one and had put up with the smell which had now gone  I repeated that it had made me feel unwell and that having googled chemicals that are used caused cancer.................That is the point at which I was told oh well you have to die from something! I said that I would not choose to die from cancer........................Sorry Tescos I am horrified at the customer service provided by Margaret at your Newport store! what happened to the customer comes first? I returned a product bought if faith that it was fit for purpose not going to make me sick  only to be faced with a rude unhelpful individual who clearly has no respect for your customers or your business.............Will not be back for a long time.  Shocked as the other lady made a sharp exit as she must have known what was coming.............Had I made a fuss right away I could understand defense  nut the THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT PILLOW BEFORE I SAID HI! SORRY TESCOS YOU HAVE LOST A CUSTOMER......					2016-01-21T21:29:07+0000	1453411747	2016-01-21 22:29:07	2	12	2	2	16	11	4	7	10	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an online order (a week last Tues for my sons birthday present) which was due in to your Market Weighton store last Friday. One part turned up(wall mount) but the tv didnt. I had an email to say it wouldnt be in on Friday  but should be in Saturday of last week....Sat came and went nothing. No phone call nothing. So Sunday I rang and got put thro to tesco direct and to cut this story short I rang Mon twice and Tuesday. Ive heard all the excuses under the sun....we cant get hold of the tesco partner we will email them...its been flagged to the cust serv team who will ring you(never did)....Item not been in stock...will be in Thurs(when it was already in store! so what the hell that person was on about who knows)...and this was the reply on Tuesday. I was promised it would be in store today. I didnt get an email text to confirm so rang your direct again and finally got a response. Its been at store since Monday. How frikkin poor is your communications team....and why you couldnt ring the me or email me is beyond me!  *********************************************However at least your 2 ladies on the customer service tesco direct counter in store at Market Weighton tonight Thurs at 6.20pm one by the name of Katie have earned top marks. They were superb and deserve recognition. Credit due where credits due********************************  Now to the point of the tesco direct barring the lady I spoke to today....your other colleagues either lie or dont have a clue or are told rubbish by the partner I had the tv ordered from.....either way ditch the partners or retrain your staff....because they are shocking. Never felt so peed off by the shabby handling from the 5/6 people I spoke to.  Thank god your store staff have an ounce between them.  ****Perhaps you could recognise these 2 members of the store team and aknowledge them for their help****  Finally one happy customer and son.

I specifically booked delivery slot of 8-10pm from the Wilton store today as I couldn t guarantee that I d be at home before then.  Unfortunately I returned to find the delivery had been made to my children at 7.40pm. There was alcohol in the order so my daughter had to ring my mum to confirm it was OK to deliver. I feel this is very irresponsible of your driver. I always ensure I am home between the booked time slot so I don t think it is too much to expect that the shopping be delivered during the alloted time.					2016-01-21T20:00:04+0000	1453406404	2016-01-21 21:00:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At first I thought it was because they were new and it would stop after a couple of washes but nope they are still doing it and have now ruined numerous pairs of underwear including two new pairs that I bought from tesco at the same time as the jeans so they are brand new and are now ruined.

I ve tried now for several years to purchase a certain brand of buttermilk (Lowicz) at my local Tesco in Middleton.  Its never in stock! It used to be...but hasn t been available in store at least for three or more years now. This is the puzzle. It is always available via online shopping at Tesco.com? Even customer services at the store don t understand why this is the case and have advised me to contact Tesco... Why is this? Also why should I have to spend large amounts on a full shop online when I just occasionally want the odd item? http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=264641073  I buy it in Sainsbury s now...but have to travel three mile extra for it.					2016-01-21T19:00:04+0000	1453402804	2016-01-21 20:00:04	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know the eggs are still in date and are alright but why should i now need to check everything. Unfortunately my wife has used 1/2 the tray without realising or i would have taken them back and made an official report about this. So please all be careful as the dates might be worse than these.					2016-01-21T18:20:32+0000	1453400432	2016-01-21 19:20:32	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco went from  so sorry we ll sort that   to my sitting all day for a courier that was never coming because  customer service  thought they d emailed me to say it was through one of their trading partners and i had to contact said partners myself.

Could anyone explain why?  I am not vegetarian but do like a meat free alternative  other than a cheese and onion - which I am not keen on.

I live a long way from big stores (30mile) which takes close on 1 hour due to type of roads.  I purcahase delivery savers but very dissappointed with the shelf life of fresh produce.  eg on the website it gives 1+ weeks for carrots  when received 2 days. Lamb kidneys website 1+ weeks delivered 4 days.  the list goes on. Emailed Tesco  email received  dotcom manager will phone today   no phone call  emailed again next day customer service assistant rang  I asked to speak to the manager and he informed me supplier problems  if you don t like the dates on the products don t accept the delivery  when I explained how I rely on the goods due to the distance from stores I was told nothing he can do about it.  IS THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE..........Why advertise things they cannot deliver is this not misrepresentation?					2016-01-21T16:20:12+0000	1453393212	2016-01-21 17:20:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I normally bulk buy pampers nappies from yourselves when they are on offer. I work out where is the cheapest per nappy and it has always been your offers that work out the cheapest out of all the retailers so well done there so I buy around 700 nappies at a time. The last couple of times I have ordered them for pick up for convenience with no problems until now. Last week I picked up the packs I had ordered and was informed the ones I had chosen were out of stock so a different pack size replaced them and I was given a price match refund and assured it worked out a better deal for me even though I am now 80 nappies short to what I ordered. After checking when I have came home though and working out the price per nappy  I have paid an extra penny per nappy which I know doesn t sound like much. What s a penny people say but when you times that by a good few hundred  it soon adds up. I couldve went to other shops more local to myself if I wanted to pay the extra price but I went out of my way to get the best deals which hasn t worked out the best deal. I think really if your going to substitute items and price match you really need to work out the prices correctly so the  customer is still getting the best deal.					2016-01-21T15:07:08+0000	1453388828	2016-01-21 16:07:08	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had my Samsung phone from yourselves  when I had an issue with my phone I took it back into the Cradley Heath store where I had the phone on contract.  The gentleman on the desk himself was puzzled and he couldn‚Äôt work out why the phone wasn‚Äôt working.  My granddaughter has the same phone and he advised me to try her battery in my phone.  The same issue the phone was just constantly vibrating  your staff was unsure why this was happening and could see there was no damage to the phone whatsoever.  So they sent me a packet so I could send the phone off for investigation.  I then get a phone call to state the phone was damaged when there was no damage  the phone went into fault.  First I was told the battery was damaged and would cost around ¬£46 to repair.  I wasn‚Äôt happy about this as they were making out this to be my fault.  Then the next call I have they are telling me the phone has a one inch crack????  The phone was in perfect condition as seen by Tesco staff in Cradley heath and by myself.  The man I spoke with on the phone was a bit abrupt and just wanted to get the money from me.  I expressed I was upset about this as the phone was in perfect condition.  In the end I had to say please send me the phone back.  I have been completely let down by yourselves and surprised for such a large company.					2016-01-21T14:15:07+0000	1453385707	2016-01-21 15:15:07	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It turning up early! I actually understand how they can be late but early??? Thanks to this early delivery the 7 month old baby which I had spent half an hour nursing to sleep was woken up by the dog which I would have put out the back just as I was putting him down in his cot.  So thanks to this instead of the hour I would have had to put my shopping away  making some lunch for me and the 3 year old and getting to maybe drink a warmish cup of tea  I had a over tired baby in a sling screaming at me and resisting going back to sleep and is now sat trying to attack the above mentioned dog  and will now in about an hour realise he s knackered and decide he wants that nap  which will be disturbed as I need to do the school pick up!

You are offering  on tesco direct  3x packs for ¬£10. I use your delivery service weekly  to give me more free time at the weekends  but for me to take advantage of this offer I will have to order my nappies separately. So instead of getting them in my normal grocery order  I would now have to wait for two deliveries? Surely the offer should be the same regardless of what platform they are ordered from?					2016-01-20T22:53:40+0000	1453330420	2016-01-20 23:53:40	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I drove to the tesco extra instead of going to tesco local cause I thought there would be more choice I was very dissapointed to see the whole beauty section closed off.  I understand that the beautician desks close but for normal things like lip balm  body lotion face wipes etc is there any need to close that off!!!  I ended up dumping my trolley then had to drive back past my home to go to sainsburys.  I do however want to apologize to the young girl in your store I moaned at I was just very angry.					2016-01-20T21:45:05+0000	1453326305	2016-01-20 22:45:05	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bit disappointed and not going to waste 40 mins driving back with receipt. It was Tesco Exmouth and the items were Sushi taster advertised as 50p - actually charged ¬£1.35 and 2x salmon appertisers advertised at ¬£1 each but actually ¬£2 each. Therefore my trip to tesco cost me ¬£2.85 more than I had planned. Doesn t sound like much but a couple of weeks ago I purchased a joint of gammon  meant to be 1/2 price but wasn t. In total this is now approx ¬£10. Surely I have been mis-sold now on 3 occasions and this isn t good enough -I cannot check every price that goes through the checkout whilst packing and would expect the instore computers to have been updated to reflect the current pricing. I look forward to hearing from you  thanks  Carla					2016-01-20T21:11:15+0000	1453324275	2016-01-20 22:11:15	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My friend today told me that another supermarket she had been to this morning had a trolley aimed for disabled children. She sent me a picture that she found from Google that was similar to the trolley she saw. It looks Absoloutly perfect and definitely something my daughter may tolerate more than the current trolleys. I was just wondering if this is something you have looked into as I know it could possibly make my shopping trip much easier  as well as no doubt thousands of other parents ‚ò∫					2016-01-20T20:40:14+0000	1453322414	2016-01-20 21:40:14	0	8	0	0	8	8	5	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently ordered from the click and collect service and yesterday went to collect my parcel. the service is lovely by the way. anyway my partner ended up leaving the parcel on the trolley when we left the store by accident. when i got home i immediately found a number for my local store and rang to only be spoken to by what i persume was head office. they informed me after a while that the manager from my local store would ring me very soon. well after almost 24 hours and no phone call visited the store only to find out nothing had been handed in. My compaint is that of who ever i spoke to on the phone didnt follow through with their actions and no phone was made to me from the store manager. I am quite upset about my parcel going missing and yes i know it is partly my fault but if something was done last nigth it might be a different story. try explaining to a toddler that he know wont be getting his new hat and scarf set. thanks					2016-01-20T17:20:16+0000	1453310416	2016-01-20 18:20:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m rather sad as my local store (Abingdon Superstore) seems to have stopped stocking  Tesco Finest Beltons Red Leicester Bite  cheese.  Has Tesco stopped stocking this altogether  or is this a temporary stock problem?  This is an amazing strong  tangy  nutty cheese and I m currently having to buy the Waitrose equivalent to get my fix.

I ve been waiting 2 weeks and phoned up on 3 occasions to customer services to ask to be put through to the store but every time the lines are busy or won t connect. Yes I could and will use another supermarket but that s not the point - it is the principle. I pay for a service which you neglect. Putting bags of potatoes onto bags of Doritos so they pop open. Out of date foods. Crazy substitutes. This week I had squashed mangos  burst houmous  popped bag of tortilla chips and a packet of sliced cooked meet that again had been squashed it was pretty much folded in half and the seal broken! It s not just the pickers it s the delivery people as well. They stack those crates with everything so there is less to carry the bleach ends up on top of a cucumber! If I fail in my role at work and do not show care and skill I don t get away with it. I don t get to dodge questions so why should you? Not getting back to a customer is just rude! This matter needs resolving now or I will be sending the photos and videos of my deliveries to Watch Dog!					2016-01-20T12:47:50+0000	1453294070	2016-01-20 13:47:50	5	3	5	0	8	3	1	2	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

The very next day I get two separate emails to say the items are out of stock. Tesco were quick enough to take my money but I have to wait 5 days to get my money back. Whoever deals with Tesco s website clearly isn t doing their job properly. I certainly won t be ordering from Tesco again.					2016-01-20T08:59:52+0000	1453280392	2016-01-20 09:59:52	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A chap asked if he could have some of it  he was told no you will have to pay for it. Whilst the employee was obviously following Tesco rules I am amazed at such food waste surely it could be donated to a food bank  schools  care homes or a soup kitchen?? The government moan that British people waste food  when actually the fat cats of empires such at Tesco are the biggest wasters of such valuable food stocks. I ve already boycotted morrisons for how they treat the farmers but feel all large supermarkets are just as bad. It s a awful thing to see huge amounts of food being wasted  I will email them but feel my voice will not be heard üëéüèªüòû shame on you Tesco					2016-01-19T21:40:52+0000	1453239652	2016-01-19 22:40:52	1	3	1	0	4	2	2	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So on Monday I walked into my town center to collect it from my local store  only to find out that it was not there. I went home and checked online why it had not been delivered  only to find out it had not left the depot  which had had it from 7am on the sunday morning  36 hours earlier.   So I called Tesco and cancelled the order  to which I was informed that it would take 3 to 5 working days for my money to be refunded. ( disgusting  you take the money instantly from my account  but takes up to 3-5 days to refund ) but you took the money fully knowing that you would not be able to deliver the said goods withing you time frame  of    order by 3 pm  pick up by 3pm next day ) So I had to accept that as well.   Then I received the cancellation email and saw that you ALSO TOOK THE 280 POINTS BACK  ( PATHETIC   PLEASE KEEP THEM )   SO I sent you an email of complaint from the email I had received  TO WHICH YOU STATE THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A REPLY WITHING 48 HOURS  SO FROM 11TH JANUARY TO TODAY  I HAVE WAITED FOR 216 HOURS AND STILL NO REPLY TO MY COMPLAINT.   TO ME TESCO DO NOT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS  OR THEY WOULD NOT TREAT PEOPLE SO DISGUSTINGLY. I FOR ONE WILL NOT BE USING TESCO FOR ANYTHING IN THE FUTURE AND I HOPE A LOT OF PEOPLE READ THIS AND FOLLOW SUIT					2016-01-19T20:23:02+0000	1453234982	2016-01-19 21:23:02	2	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

They were saying that they should ban the burqa  although it was  too late  because  they are already everywhere . They sounded quite proud of themselves  too - even looking at me as if seeking my approval. Can you please ensure some form of ignorance training for your staff so paying customers don t have to be anywhere near such disgusting  blatant prejudice? If I hadn t already pumped my gas  I d have gotten it elsewhere.   Also  while I m at it  you should have a word with the security provision at Cannon Park too. Didn t feel very secure listening to him rant about how dangerous women choosing to wear a burqa were. Not only is he a racist old idiot  but one also suspects he s terrible at his job  if that s what he imagines the greatest threat to a suburban Tesco.    If you let me know how to unsubscribe from my Clubcard  that would be great. I d rather not a/ visit your stores any more  or b/ potentially let any further racists at your organisation mine my data.   Thanks   Christina					2016-01-19T19:37:28+0000	1453232248	2016-01-19 20:37:28	28	13	28	1	42	13	12	1	42	0	28	0	0	0	0	0	0

After a few WEEKS waiting for the Slough store to said sorry for the store managers unprofessional actions. I am still waiting  I ve given my email and contact detail and.... Nothing. Tesco need to learn how to address customers complaints. 3 emails from customer service dept to say  we have sent an email to the store  So thats how you deal with your customers.

I bought my husband one on 5th September 2015 and had to send it for repair last week  not switching on or charging. Really sorry we bought this  I was going to upgrade my mobile contract to an iPhone with tesco but decided not to bother. They have had the hudle for nearly a week and it s not even fixed yet  on the phone you get told different things every time you get through to speak top someone. Not happy  tesco will be getting as little as possible from us from now on.					2016-01-19T18:32:50+0000	1453228370	2016-01-19 19:32:50	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Saturday 16th Jan the screen froze and we could not switch it off as screen frozen  screen then went blank. Now just have a bright screen that dulls when on/off button pushed. Took it back to Tesco on Sunday for the technical guys to say they would not look at it as no longer insured to do in house repairs and told me to phone the electrical help line I can t see what help this will be as the unit is obviously not working and surely as not even a month old a replacement could have been offered. As it was a christmas present for my 7 year old I am not very happy with the after care.

Today I was in your salford tesco extra store at 8.25am.The floor at the self serve check out had been mopped and was still wet  no wet floor signs were about and I slipped. Your staff fumbled around finding a wet floor sign to put out while I was left to stand around. A lady took my details and said she would be intouch today. She even said she might pop into my work to see how I was later in the day so off I hobbled to work. I have heard nothing from any staff member at tesco. I was not asked to fill out an incident report or an accident book. I find this really terrible customer care and I would like a response.					2016-01-19T18:13:21+0000	1453227201	2016-01-19 19:13:21	2	9	2	0	11	9	5	4	12	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just been to colchester highwoods store. I searched the car park for a trolley but couldn t find one. When I got inside I asked a member of staff if they could get me a trolley suitable for my children.  The only option available were a baby seat and toddler. The lady then suggested I use the trolley with a car attached. I did this however before I was even past the first aisle the trolley was full.  Luckily my husband was shopping with me so we had to use two trollies.  Once doing my shopping the member of staff came to find me to tell me you no longer provide two seater trollies. This now means I will be unable to shop in your store unless I have another adult with me to push another trolley for me. This is absolutely ridiculous! Also if I need to go when the shop is busy I will be causing more congestion by having two trollies!  Please can you let me know how I am supposed to do my shopping with my two children. Many thanks Carly					2016-01-19T18:12:01+0000	1453227121	2016-01-19 19:12:01	8	11	8	0	19	11	5	6	4	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

The in-store price is considerably cheaper than the online price (probably explains why it s out of stock).  This is for an item that is sold by Tesco   not a third party.  Why does the pricing vary between your website and in-store? Many thanks.					2016-01-19T17:51:58+0000	1453225918	2016-01-19 18:51:58	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He used his mobile to look on the Nissan site  found the correct ones for my car model and very cheerfully changed BOTH of my car key batteries. He is a great credit to Tesco.

I didn t look at the ingredients in the shop because I was in a rush. Needless to say it has gone in the bin. There are so many other vegetarian red colourings that could be used  rather than blood. I m astounded that you choose to use it. I would ve thought beetroot would provide just as good a colour.					2016-01-19T16:32:42+0000	1453221162	2016-01-19 17:32:42	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I visited your St Paul s (London) store and picked up a sandwich  crisps and a caffeine free Diet Coke.  I am unable to have caffeinated drinks  so was happy to find that you stocked the decaff version.  When I got to the till  I found it wasn t included in the meal deal!  I m confused as to why this is.  All the other Coca Cola varieties were included (normal/zero/diet/free) but decaff was not  yet if I bought it separately it would have cost the same as all the others available.  When I questioned this  the response was  we have no control over what s in the offer .  Although they were perfectly polite  I also found this to be inflexible customer service.  It would be great if you could rectify this  as it seems ridiculous to me that this would not be included!!!					2016-01-19T16:28:20+0000	1453220900	2016-01-19 17:28:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Quite a significant difference when it s not. As the baby event is now on this seems odd to change now. Can you advise when they will be on offer again?

I cannot complete these as I am HUGELY DISAPPOINTED with my last order and several of the preceding ones. I have phoned customer services numerous times  but the issue is not being addressed. PROBLEM - my  fresh  foods (such as meat) are ALL being delivered with the  use by  date on the day of delivery. Is should be really simple to rectify. Why am I still having the same issue? I sent some back this week. I ve been refunded - but then I have to go shopping (it defeats the object of home delivery). Please feel free to respond with a way of solving this.

I lugged my basket around  mind and body aching from this trip!  I was about to go to a till with a small queue when a member of staff approached me  took much needed pity on me  took my basket and took me to a self serve till and put it all through for me and bagged it all  took the time to speak to my daughter and get her helping out. I m 6 months pregnant so aching is a normality  but  I could have actually hugged this lovely lady. When I felt like crying after battling with my bored child she made my life easier for 10 minutes. I didn t catch her name but she was a young member of staff and I appreciate her help so much. I know they are paid to  serve  but she totally didn t have to help at all  thankyou very much indeed üòä					2016-01-19T13:18:09+0000	1453209489	2016-01-19 14:18:09	12	1	12	0	13	1	1	0	0	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you advise at which point since the introduction of the baggage charge have the lovely  environmentally friendly  baggage reusing customers of yours now forgone their right to have their groceries bagged for them?  On many occasions  I have gone and been asked if I would like a bag and very proudly proclaimed no (like an environmentalist at a stake out) to then fish out my already paid for and used tesco reusable  place it within the basket/on the checkout only for my groceries to get piled along side said bag like the fond bagging game I m accustom to at ALDI...?   I didn t realise the bag and service were chargeable by this scheme? All in all I m not particularly angry just confused and amused....

This morning went to Tesco s and found that some items were cheaper in Asda than Tesco s. For eaxaple Frys Benton tinned pies ¬£1 and one cup porrage ¬£1. I understand that you have to buy 10 different items to be able to claim the difference. So 10 pies at Tesco ¬£21.90 yet at Asda ¬£10. The price match seems a bit of a con.					2016-01-19T13:11:19+0000	1453209079	2016-01-19 14:11:19	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I took it to costumer services with the glass and was refunded. The customer service rep scanned my club card and told me I would hear from Tesco when they had investigated. I also reported it on this site and was told the same  I still have not heard a thing from Tesco and am now wondering if it was looked into at all. Ignoring broken glass in food isafety not good practice and could result in others being hurt. Ignoring customers is not wise either with such a wide variety of other stores to choose from !					2016-01-19T12:27:56+0000	1453206476	2016-01-19 13:27:56	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know sometimes when an item is on offer there is a limit to how many people can buy. Does this apply only when stated?  I was in store this morning & as I approached a checkout I noticed a gentleman buying lots of Hot Wheels cars that were on offer. I returned to the toy aisle to see if I could complete my son s collection of the limited edition Porches to find that the gentleman had brought every single one of both collections on offer. Obviously having duplicates is not for his own personal use & I am very disappointed that he was allowed to buy in bulk  (I heard the cashier day his total & was over ¬£50). I have tried a few other local stores & non have them in stock.					2016-01-19T11:54:19+0000	1453204459	2016-01-19 12:54:19	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I get that shelves need stocking but when I worked in retail for five years you d always step aside if a customer was there. In the last aisle there were three staff members having a chat blocking the whole aisle  no stock with them at all!  Then as we went to pay  a fire alarm went off. I understand these things happen it but the checkout staff didn t know what to do. Our chap looked at the team leader on the floor who shrugged and he eventually decided to put the last two items of my mother s shopping through. She tried to pay with her card but the transaction apparently failed and he was taken away from the till in his wheelchair by another member of staff as they began to evacuate. The lady said she d finish our transaction quickly but then decided we had to leave instead and without looking at the till insisted we leave my mother s groceries there.   Chaos  and very frustrating when you spend an hour in store negotiating obstacles  staff in the way and items out of stock to then have such confusion and be sent away empty handed.   We chose to leave the store - the queue at the tills had already been 4 or 5 deep without any further tills being opened so you can only imagine what it must have been like when the store was re opened. Only to find out this morning that the card payment had gone through correctly  and she s been charged for the shopping we were prevented from taking!  From someone unlikely to go back to this store  the staff need better training on behaviour while customers are in store  there needs to be a better understanding of what happens during a fire alarm or other emergency situation  and the team leaders need to be more proactive - opening more tills at busy times and giving answers to their team members when looking to direction.   Poor show.					2016-01-19T10:19:12+0000	1453198752	2016-01-19 11:19:12	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Making sure your customers are safe? I thought this too!! But on saturday morning in your southport branch  where the temperature through the night had been -2 the car park was NOT gritted. So as i walked through parent and child carrying my 2 year old daughter i witnessed a lady fall over so i went over to help her  little did i know she had slipped on black ice. So i indeed also fell taking my  2 year old with me and landing on top of her. So as i lay there in a heap i assesed my daughters injuries  mouth filled with blood  bump on her head- but thankfully nothing major. As we both got up  helped by a lovely tesco customer i realised my back took the brunt of the fall. We walked back to the car  my daughter and myself both crying  shocked and bruised. I realised i couldnt drive my car home as i was in too much pain. So my mum came to the resuce. I did go and speak to the security guard to tell him of the incident incase anyone else slipped  he offered 1st aid which i refused as to be honest i just wanted to get my daughter home.  So i ask you tesco  why did u not bother to grit your car park?  Is it not common sense? your manager didnt seem to think so when my husband went in to complain later that day- his response was they had gritted SOME of the car park AFTER most of the ice had melted. So its really not good enough is it?					2016-01-19T07:23:51+0000	1453188231	2016-01-19 08:23:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Being particularly fond of the odour neutralising scent which you apply to the bags. However since the purchase of my last batch of bags  the quality appears to have slipped. The issue being that approximately 1 in 3 bags are not sealed at the bottom. As you can imagine this comes as a great inconvince when I place my hand into the bag to pick up and dispose of my dogs excrement. To find that my hand has gone through the bottom of the bag and the sh*t is now in direct contact with my fingers. Although my girlfriend seems to find great satisfaction and humour in this misfortune  I however do not. I am keen to hear your views on the situation  as I am extremely disappointed in the failure of this product. I have some photos which I can upload as proof if required.

Go to collect shopping to find they have cancelled it for no known reason. On the phone for 3 hours being promised it ll be delivered for them turning around and saying nothing they can do just re-order. Helpful when u work and have no time. Extremely rude in the click and collect department. Especially David Arnold and Walter. Tesco think because there a big food chain they can speak to customers how they like. But what a joke them not bothering to let there customers know there orders cancelled and then make broken promises. 3 hours on the phone to try and get my shopping and still nothing!!					2016-01-18T19:32:20+0000	1453145540	2016-01-18 20:32:20	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Lots of items I buy regularly have gone off the list. Add this to the fact that things I buy are no longer stocked and the delivery drivers are in such a hurry that last time he drove off before I had finished unpacking the last box! I have come to the conclusion that Tesco no longer want me as a customer. Bye bye Tesco will be sticking with reliable Ocado.					2016-01-18T19:27:43+0000	1453145263	2016-01-18 20:27:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon paying for my shopping (over ¬£50 worth) I realised I d forgotten to get cashback   the lady on the till advised I pop over to the cigarette counter and I only needed to buy one item so I did.   I went to the cigarette counter to buy a scratch card as I needed ¬£5 cash back to send in the post   the lady served me but gave me coins and I said I m sorry please could I have a note  she said no I haven t got any. I explained I needed it for putting in an envelope to post and didn t want to send coins. She said well I haven t got any!!! In quite a rude tone! She said you can come round here and check my till if you want! I said that wasn t nessessery  it s alright and asked could I go to a till then and ask them to swap it for me. She said yeah but they can t just open it. Which I understood.  I went to a till point that I saw a customer had finished paying and was open and quickly said  oh excuse me before you shut your till please could I swap my ¬£5 coins given to me at the cigarette counter for a note. The man on the till just looked at me  so I said I m sorry it s just the cigerette counter had no notes and I need a note to put into an envelope to send in the post. He said YEAH AND!!!! I said I have the right money it was just given to me in coins and I showed him along with my receipt. He huffed and puffed and said well we re not a bank! And snatched my coins and handed me the note  I said excuse me! He said well what do you think  we re not a bank! I said there s no need to be rude I m not asking you to be a bank I m just asking if I could swap these coins given at your stores cigarette counter. People around me were looking and I began to feel very upset and embarrassed  i thanked the man anyway and walked off quickly to post my letter. I felt in shock at how rude they had both been to me.   I m not a complainer but I m sorry it isn t nice to make people feel that way and I really hope it doesn t happen to anyone else.					2016-01-18T17:29:34+0000	1453138174	2016-01-18 18:29:34	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a plush 8  Rapunzel doll as it was on offer for ¬£4 (had a yellow label on the shelf) this was on 3rd Jan  I even asked the lady at the till to check that it was ¬£4  she said yes it was. When I got home I checked the receipt and it showed ¬£8. The store is 30 minutes away from me and only went back yesterday 17th Jan. I informed the customer service desk and she said nothing can be done now because it s back to ¬£8. I then called customer service today and was passed between departments informing both operators what had happened and if they could check it was ever on offer at ¬£4 (starting to question myself by now that I saw the wrong label)  I was then told I need to speak to the store  as I was passed through I was on hold for another several minutes  I gave up and put the phone down as had to go on the school run. Can someone please tell me whether this doll was on offer at ¬£4  I know it s only ¬£4 but I would never have bought it knowing it was ¬£8. Thanks.					2016-01-18T17:10:33+0000	1453137033	2016-01-18 18:10:33	1	14	1	0	15	14	9	5	13	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wondering whether you can do something about idiots without children parking in your parent and child parking spaces in Kidderminster? Multiple times now  I ve had to park in a small space while trying to get my baby out of the car without bumping the one next to me  whilst fat Sandra from Kidderminster is sat in her childless car  in my designated space  shoving copious amounts of Mr Kipling down her throat. It would be fantastic if you could hire a warden or something. I ll even by him/her a Dolmio snack pot (which are at a ¬£1 bargain at the moment) for their great work.  Thank you.					2016-01-18T17:09:59+0000	1453136999	2016-01-18 18:09:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My shopping was just delivered a wee while ago by such a lovely  helpful and friendly driver. I didn t catch her name but she was excellent  very efficient and happy to help. I m just out of hospital having had surgery and therefore not at my best and it makes all the difference when someone is helpful and chatty as I m stuck in the house. She was great with my grumpy cat too and is overall a huge credit to Tesco!

Fair enough  these things happen. But if I want to arrange delivery for the next day I ve to pay again for my order and wait up to 5 days for a refund on the first order! Complained to be told  I m sorry that you aren t happy with this process and will feed back to the relevant department although I can t see this changing in the near future if at all.  New order would be over ¬£10 dearer due to change in prices! Wonder if they have a spare ¬£80 to put in limbo for a week mid January??					2016-01-18T15:13:39+0000	1453130019	2016-01-18 16:13:39	4	24	4	0	28	24	8	16	14	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Certainly my local store seems to have a very arbitrary approach.   I volunteer with a national charity that operates also on a local level in the area and despite my colleagues dropping off posters for fundraising events they never seem to be displayed.    The process ad infinitum seems to be as follows: drop poster off  explaining that it benefits the charity - poster is put in draw for a decision to be made (by whom and on what criteria is never made clear) - notice poster doesn t appear and enquire about - be told poster has disappeared from drawer - repeat.....

She has worked for Tesco for many years and now is in charge of one of the retierment groups. Well over a week ago she attempted to order something in store and was told they couldnt do it and to ring up on the Friday of which she did. Then to be told later that the item was lost in transit and they would re-order it. They never re-ordered it until she phoned to ask where it was. Now after another 5 days she is now being told they dont even have enough of the item to give to her.... You were quick to take the money from her but are not giving her the item after over 11 days and lots of phone calls to you. STOP TAKING PEOPLES MONEY BUT NOT THEIR ITEMS!!!!!!

Now I know the reductions are put out approx 15.15. So I hung around for a while. I then notice the tesco employee with all the reductions (not yet on the shelf). A min goes by and the crates are then put out.  I did managed to get a few items. But I did think  there wasn t a lot of meat .  I m now at the till area (basket self service) I then notice x2 tesco employees with lots of meat in their baskets. And on these meat products is reduced labels. At no point did I notice these items  at the meat reduction section or the tesco staff members. I did think they may of been reduced earlier in the day. But then I notice the prices. Same prices as the other reductions.  So I can only put 2 and 2 together!!!!!  That staff within this store are getting to these items before customers.  I find this very unfair.   I have spoken to Tesco HQ to make a complaint  I just wanted to make the general public no.					2016-01-18T11:59:35+0000	1453118375	2016-01-18 12:59:35	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why even put them on to order if you have no intention of ever sending stock to the store? Retail works on supply and demand - if you put it on the site to be ordered at least have the decency to get stock to the stores to fulfil orders..... You have done this before with Donkey Kong & Pokemon and then again with Call Of Duty & Halo then you go and pull this one  I think you are going to be getting lots of irate customers calling you today and once again  all you will be saying is  SORRY  but as far as I m concerned   SORRY  is not going to cut it.....					2016-01-18T08:13:39+0000	1453104819	2016-01-18 09:13:39	0	14	0	0	14	13	3	10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your product are extremely good value and I regularly buy body spray etc for the people we serve on the Street. I am retired now and only have a limited income so I can only buy so much. My question is do you ever have any dented items that you could donate to us or overstock which you throw away. Maybe you may have assorted items that could be purchased at a reduced price. We need food  toiletries  ladies sanitary items  anything that you would use for personal hygiene also I try to buy fruit  eggs  cakes  chocolate and biscuits  I am very passionate about helping the homeless and if you could help us even in a small way it would make such a difference to the people we serve. We are a registered charity. Thank you so much. Gill					2016-01-17T20:36:50+0000	1453063010	2016-01-17 21:36:50	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There were some lovely members of the public who stayed with me too  sadly I only remember the names of two of the Tesco women  Hannah and Carol.

I complained recently about the freshness of your veg eg onions  garlic etc. Thankyou for your kind responses. I dont come on this page to just complain. And i believe credit should be given where credit is due. Ive noticed a huge improvement in my local store   langney eastbourne with regards to product freshness  Could you also kindly let the store manager know what wonderful staff they have there. Its a pleasure to shop there as ALL the staff are so friendly and helpful. I see tesco employees singing and dancing as they work because they genuinely enjoy working in the store. Brilliant.

After checking on your website I am now also completely confused. As always working full time & being a parent time is limited and the convenience of your brand match is perfect for doing the shopping in one place however  today I purchased a 60 wash Persil non bio liquid detergent the price in store being ¬£13 but knowing  (or so I thought) that I would get ¬£6 off at the till as Sainsburys are selling it for ¬£7 as part of the brand match. After checking my receipt & finding out I only saved ¬£2.38 on my brand match I went to customer services only to be told I needed to have at least 10 items that were more expensive to get the brand match!!! But I thought you had to purchase at least 10 items ( trust me I definately passed this part) then I could have the brand match!! Could you please clarify why I should not return the one purchased with you in store today & purchase it at Sainsburys instead?					2016-01-17T17:53:14+0000	1453053194	2016-01-17 18:53:14	3	4	3	0	7	4	3	1	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

We arrived to find that there was not one single parent and child space available so had to park quite a way from the store in order to be able to have enough room to get the car seat out  we then found that there was no trolley s for car seats available nor were there any that our child could be strapped into so small trolley it was.  We entered the store to find that a lot of the shelves were looking bare. Once we had managed to get items that were available we then had the enjoyment of your tills...... We reached them to find that there was queues up the aisles of each till including the self service tills. After waiting for a while we managed to leave the till we were at to go to self service  to top it off we seen the till supervisor standing at the corner of the clothes department laughing at the fact of how big the queues were......how about she call for extra staff to help out or even open up a till for her self.  I can say also that we were not the only one who seen this nor were we the only ones to be  miffed  by the queues. Needles to say it was very enjoyable.......					2016-01-17T14:00:30+0000	1453039230	2016-01-17 15:00:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I chatted to your customer service online to find out if there was any other way to order to a different store as I was prepared to travel and pick up the cake.  There are around 10 other stores I could easily travel to and was prepared to travel further if needed only to be told if it wasnt availble from my selected store then I couldnt order the cake. This seems a bit ridiculous  can you clarify that this is correct?					2016-01-17T13:47:29+0000	1453038449	2016-01-17 14:47:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I use your click and collect service every week as both myself and my husband work full time  however on several occasions now we have been left disappointed both by the service and the customer service received.  over the past Few months we have experienced the following issues  1. Shopping not ready despite it being within our collection slot.  2. No one manning click and collect meaning we have to phone through to the store for someone to come and help  sometimes the phone just rings out and we are left waiting. This has happened on multiple occasions. 3. refunded for the wrong substituted items.  we accept that on some occasions this will happen but these issues now seem to affect our shop nearly every week. When staff come there is often no apology or even and recognition that sometimes we gave been waiting nearly half an hour.  this is very disappointing given that we spend on average ¬£60 per week with tesco.   we one like to complain but feel we have been left with no choice!					2016-01-17T12:37:34+0000	1453034254	2016-01-17 13:37:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I picked up a lovely pair of boots and went to purchase them. To my horror  I was I informed that the balanced on the card was ¬£0!!! I had the receipt from Tesco saying the card was  activated  (which was useless!). I was informed that I could go to any Tesco store for them to resolve this.   This morning  I went to my local Tesco - who called up the customer services  they simply repeated what I knew ... The balance on the card had been activated and the balance was ¬£0!!! The staff and Duty manager told me I was on my own to deal with this (after saying that 1) I had spent the money (which I categorically have not!!!) or 2) someone else could have spent it online (but.. the card can t be used online!!!!).   I tried to call the number on the back and cannot get through to customer services ... As it stands  I ve been embarrassed in Monsoon & Tesco  accused of spending the money when I haven t and have no idea who should help get this fixed. I would be grateful for advice on how to  full amount put back on this card.   I will not be buying a third party gift card from Tesco nor will I be recommending this to others!

Even their disabled toilet isn t marked out clearly    My son was  assaulted in tescos.. He s very disabled and because of the way the cctv is placed the police couldn t catch the man who did this to him..  My second question.. WHY TESCOS WHY...  Every little helps!! REALLY...

As we were leaving the shop  we heard shouting and someone shouting get off me and as anybody would realistically  we stopped to have a look. As we ve walked back to the security alarms that are by the exits I see a black man making his way down the isle with a security guard on his back and his arm around his neck; the man continued to say get off me as they continued struggling down towards the tills! Another security man came and tried to calm the man down - the only reason he became aggravated was because of the way they were handling him! The security guard that later made his way to the commotion joined in with restraining the man! Several people started to circulate and look at what was going on so I didn t get a clear look at how many people had a hold of him at this point but they pushed him into one the tills to their right and then turned him around managed to force him into the till to their left which made the till turn around! They then forced the man to the floor where they proceeded to have hold of him! One of the security guards knelt on the mans legs and the other man knelt on the floor and had a hold of his neck. The man on the floor continued to say I can t breath  can you get off I can t breath! After a few minutes a man in a suit who I can only presume worked there came over  crouched to the floor and told the man to release him from the neck which the man did so. We shortly left after this. We don t actually know what the man had done wrong but regardless of whether this man had done wrong or not  the way that the security guards in Tesco treated this man and handled him was absolutely appalling. I don t know what their policy says about handling people but I m certain that it s nothing like what me and my mom witnessed today!					2016-01-16T23:40:58+0000	1452987658	2016-01-17 00:40:58	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently ordered groceries from Tesco and i am really disappointed. I ordered around 30 items- first of all the delivery guy came an hour later than the time slot i asked for  secondly he only got half of the items and that too in a very pathetic condition.. The yogurt was spilled all over in the basket  carrots were broken into pieces etc.. The worst part is that delivery guy didn t even know that he only got half of my order.. he just said only 1 item is unavailable - i had to tell him that more than half of the items are missing.  Even after all that i still haven t received back the money for the items which were missing and its been 2 weeks. I really think if you can server well then you should stop online grocery delivery service. I would really appreciate if someone can look into this and at least return the money for the missing items.					2016-01-16T23:30:27+0000	1452987027	2016-01-17 00:30:27	0	2	0	1	3	2	2	0	22	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I sustained an injury outside of the store which caused me to feel faint and nauseated.  I sat down near by the desk where you can purchase cigarettes (which I assumed was a customer service desk) and fainted twice due to shock.  I couldn t tell you how long I had been there due to the fact I was alone at this time.  I sat up slowly after fainting the first time  looked around to see two staff members on the desk staring at me and then I fainted again. It was only when my brother demanded someone got a first aider that the two staff members did something. I believe a night manager came over to ask if I was okay and if I needed an ambulance and took me to their canteen area where I was able to recover slightly before going to hospital.    I am disgusted that the two staff members didn t come over to ask if I was okay or didn t have the initiative to call somebody over. I can only guess I was there for 10 minutes max alone lying on the floor at the front of the store. I am grateful that I only suffered with very minor concussion and it wasn t something more serious. However waking up shaking not knowing where I was for a few moments to strangers staring at me made me feel very vulnerable. It only occurred to me when my brother ran over that i was unconscious with no one watching over me to ensure my safety which upon reflection petrifys me.  I want to thank the night manager who helped me after the incident. I want my story to be heard so this doesn t happen again in this store.					2016-01-16T22:24:48+0000	1452983088	2016-01-16 23:24:48	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I brought a Canon printer from your Baldock store today. My husband noticed it had looked like the box has been opened and cellotaped back up. It was the only one left so questioned it with a member of staff who reassured him there would be no way it would be a return as they are not allowed to put them back on the shop shelves. On returning home we opened the box to discover a birthday card in there  the ink opened and put in the wrong way round and instructions screwed up into a ball. Clearly this has been brought and returned and put back on the shelf. I did not pay for essentially a second hand item and to say I m annoyed is an understatement.					2016-01-16T21:27:38+0000	1452979658	2016-01-16 22:27:38	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Took it back today becaus it was faulty. Currently on tablet number 4 and guess what ? This one is faulty too. What s even worse is the attitude of the company and staff when they say  iPads are better  or  not our problem . It is your problem for selling faulty items.

I was curious to see what precautions were being taken with regards to public & environmental health and safety. I asked one of the members of staff what was in the recycling bay she said it was just a bucket that the bulbs were dropped into  her statement mortified me! The dangers of broken energy saving light bulbs as you should well be aware are extremely detrimental to the public & environmental health and safety. The thought of the damage that this is potentially having to your customers  staff and the environment is very disturbing. When I expressed my concerns to your member of staff her reply was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs something that I haven‚Äôt thought about  I will go and speak to somebody‚Äù. I finished my conversation by reiterating my concerns and encouraging her to speak to someone and proceeded to leave the store with very little intention of coming back until these health hazards are removed or better precautions are put in place. I most certainly hope that you will look into this matter for the benefit to your customers  staff and the environment.  Many thanks					2016-01-16T11:43:42+0000	1452944622	2016-01-16 12:43:42	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I stopped using them  changing to paracetamol/ibuprofen  and after a few days felt better.    I realise that every cold is different  so I thought nothing of this until yesterday. My husband had been off work with cold/flu symptoms but  being a man  hadn t taken anything. I suggested that he took some paracetamol but when he went to get some  he found the Tesco cold and flu capsules left over from my cold. Shortly after taking them  he complained that he felt really dizzy and sick.   I understand that you re not going to give refunds to everyone who claims that medicines haven t worked  but I thought I should notify you of this in case it was a dodgy batch  especially as we have both used them before with no problems.					2016-01-15T21:07:07+0000	1452892027	2016-01-15 22:07:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I shop at Tescos stores all the time  but they clearly  don t like me. Well your customer service is left to be desired and hasnt helped me at all. You FAQ online didn t help me either.  And I have looked at the Terms and Conditions. It says you must have PERMISSION from account holders to have a joint account. If you have joined me onto my Mothers  I never gave you permission! As long as there are only 2 members in a household and no more  that own a clubcard EACH  it is okay to have 2 in the same household. So I have signed up when I was 18... I am 22 now  almost 23. What does that tell you?  I ve gone online to check whether I have made any mistakes... but I haven t but the site tells me it needs my clubcard number and my details...again...  For one  you already have my details... and secondly... how can I give you my clubcard number if I DON T HAVE ONE!?  I never received an email with the details  or a comfirmation. So tell me Tesco  what are you playing at? Do you not want me as a customer?  JOKE!					2016-01-15T20:26:47+0000	1452889607	2016-01-15 21:26:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was told I would be called back and as would need to talk to the manager. This was in Monday and still I have heard nothing back . I m disgusted by what has happened and can t believe that my complaint has been ignored. The amount of money I spend in your company and not at other supermarkets is a joke I think I might have to take my money to a supermarket that is more interested in there customers then money...... üò°üò°üò°					2016-01-15T20:08:47+0000	1452888527	2016-01-15 21:08:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was hoping to bring to your attention the horrific situation that my wife came home to late one evening that I feel you are responsible for. The reason she was home so late was a result of working another evening shift in one of your fine stores but the fact that you deprive me of quality time with my wife over numerous evenings of the week is not the subject of this letter. I do however hold you personally responsible for a dramatic unfolding of events that proved to be very stressful for all concerned in my household.  I had just completed a long and stressful day at work when all I want to do is come home  put my feet up and eat a nice hot meal. As I knew my wife was working that evening  I knew I wasn t going to be having her finest Michelin star restaurant equivalent culinary delights. However  being the caring soul that she is  she left me one of your finest ready meals instead in the form of a microwaveable Tesco tikka massala with rice and bombay potato as I would be fending for myself that evening. As a result of my lack of cooking skills that could be compared to that of a neandarthal  this is her way of ensuring I eat something more nutritious than a pack of Quavers and some Jammmie Dodgers for my evening meal.  This particular evening  I came home after picking up my 1 year old boy from his grandmother after work. I spent some quality time playing with him and watching ‚ÄúIn the night garden‚Äù  a program that I gathered to be about miniature wooden figaruines and chubby furry aliens before putting him to bed. A great evening so far. However  this great evening didn t last. What broke me this evening wasn t the fact that my darling boy had emptied an entire box of corn flakes into the kitchen bin  nor that my two canine pets then proceeded to empty the bin on to the kitchen floor  nor was it that we were so dangerously low on cow juice that I would have to sacrifice my morning Coco Pops in favour of toast. What broke me this particular evening was your tikka massala with rice and bombay potato.   First of all  I noted that the ratio of rice to bombay potato and curry was slightly disappointing but that s neither here nor there. I was willing to see past the crime against rice to curry and bombay potato ratio and didn t dismiss the curry in favour of Quavers and Jammie Dodgers. As any other person that is challenged in the cooking department  I paid particular attention to the instructions on the packaging and piereced the film lid several times and placed the tikka massala into my microwave oven for the time specified. So far so good. I felt like a pro. I went and put my feet up in the living room to watch some TV while I waited. I then heard that familiar beeping sound of a microwave that has just completed its duties. I skipped and jumped excitedly to the kitchen that my hunger was about to be satisfied. I excitedly opened the microwave and grabbed hold of my now ready to eat Tesco tikka massala with rice and bombay potato. I admit I burnt my hands somewhat in my excitement grabbing it from the microwave but I ll let that slide.  I attempted to tear open the film lid. To my dismay  I was left with a small piece of the film lid in my hands that hadn t broken through to my dinner. A repeat attempt from another corner provided the same results. Numerous attempts provided the same results with an increasing amount of anger. I thought to myself that I do not recall having this struggle from the microwaveable meals obtained from budget supermarkets despite the increased cost of the Tesco equivalent.  I then reached for a sharp stabbing implement from the kitchen drawer to aid me in breaking in. It was beginning to look more likely that the Queen might pop in for a scone and a gossip than it did me getting into my meal. I stabbed down at the troublesome tikka massala in my attempt to release it from its prison and to my horror  it slipped off the edge of the kitchen worktop and hit the deck. Roughly translated  I thought ‚Äúoh bother!‚Äù. Both of my canine ‚Äúfriends‚Äù heard it hit the deck. I was for a brief moment in time astounded and observed in awe at how fast they moved. It was really rather impressive. They went faster than the Malteasers out of a box of Celebrations on Christmas day. However  as the sauce that spilt through the pierced lid began to burn my foot  I returned to reality and witnessed my hounds running away with said tikka massala and finding their own way into the packaging to devour what was supposed to be my dinner. I cried. Man s best friend apparently. They never even let me into their secret of how they got into the packaging.  As a result   my wife came home to two dogs with excessive flatulence  a rather upset husband who d demolished what was left of the Quavers and Jammie Dodgers  a  stain on the kitchen floor that kind of resembles a workplace accident at the Tango factory  and a 1 year old boy that is now uttering words that sounded not to dissimilar to ‚Äúsit‚Äù and ‚Äúclucking heck‚Äù. I cannot help but think that these unfortunate events could have been avoided if you had gone to the expense of providing packaging for your microwaveable meals that could actually be torn off without the use of a stabbing implement. I am sure there are many out there that have experienced exactly the same as I have. I therefore request that you may review your ready meal packaging to avoid others suffering the same fate of having to sleep in the spare room for causing canine intestinal misery and teaching their young ones profanities.  Kind regards   Kris					2016-01-15T19:56:10+0000	1452887770	2016-01-15 20:56:10	20	2	20	2	24	2	2	0	2	0	19	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your delivery driver in van BC15 EKT thjs evening at 7.20pm in Old Oxted in Surrey caused a complete block in the road as he decided to over take an obstruction on his side and refuse to reverse for any road users despite the fact there were 4 of us waiting to come up the hill  4 cars who had right of way. When someone tried to reason with your driver he became verbally abusive  shouting at people. I don t think this is acceptable behaviour from someone representing your company who was in the wrong to start with and then compounded the error. The only way the situation was resolved was for me to drive my vehicle on the pavement and 3 other cars to reverse a distance down a hill to get out his way. Your driver wasn t done  he proceeded to clap at us in the car as he drove past whilst continuing his abusive shouting I think you ll agree something needs to be done					2016-01-15T19:27:53+0000	1452886073	2016-01-15 20:27:53	0	8	0	0	8	8	1	7	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just so happen to be having a bad skin day today so my eczema is rather noticeable on my face. This team member took the opportunity  whilst I wasn t looking I might add  to catch the attention of the cashier serving me and highlight my skin condition using hand motions to point at me and her face to show the areas of eczema. This to me is a form of public mocking and makes me very angry. What this person didn t realise is that my mother was behind me at a different check out and saw the whole thing. I hope this person gets an extensive amount of disciplinary action  because there will be a detailed report and complaint going to their Head Office! If necessary I have receipts with time stamps and a description of the person.					2016-01-15T18:47:47+0000	1452883667	2016-01-15 19:47:47	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well you re  not doing it now and my son was a bit gutted not to get his free cookie. My son asked the security guard where the cookies had gone and he politely said  we re not doing it anymore  he could see the disappointment on my son s face so went to his own personal lunch box behind the security desk and gave my son one of his oranges.

My 8 year old daughter has coeliacs disease and very much relies on the products you sell.  I feel it is fairly priced in comparison to many health stores and on line stores but most importantly for remembering that children  have different needs from adults.

Assumed it was just because I m not great at balancing only to realise I had slid in a nice puddle of car oil stuff (technical term) that some other idiot who can t maintain their car properly had left. So brushed myself off  went back to my car to clean off my hands and realised the oil was all over my nice cream coat and boring work dress. Then I went into store to tell customer services what had happened who were really nice and gave me ¬£20 towards getting my coat dry cleaned (fairly sure they ll have to be time travellers to fix the mess on it). I told the manager where the oil spillage was and naturally thought they would do something about it  especially as it s located in parent and child parking. Only today I ve gone back to store (because I m really sad and come in a few times a week for chocolate  milk  break but mainly chocolate) and seen that the same patch has still not been cleared up in anyway. This was my face when I saw it :( So whilst I thought yesterday  that s really nice  Tesco didn t have to give me any money towards my coat because it s technically not their fault   today I m a little bit more annoyed that the manager was more interested in how much it would cost her to get rid of me and not on stopping the same thing happening again. Here s hoping if anyone else falls they are lucky like me and only get a sore hand  bum and ego and feel a bit sad about the loss of a nice coat.

My 8 year old son has been off school I ll so have no choice to take him shopping with me. Went to my local store in Didcot to do a large shop. After caring him all the way from the car wash at the back of the car park I can t find the disabled trolley. I ask at the desk and she goes and looks for it. But she can t find it. Instead she bring in this shallow small trolley the clips on to a wheel chair and offers me a wheelchair. I point out to her I need to buy large items hence why I went to a big store. Nappies/toilet rolls ect. She then says  can t you put him in the child s seat in a normal trolley  he s 8 and heavy. So I carry him back to the car wash and wait 30min for my car to be washed (was meant to be in the warm doing my shopping while this was being done). SO I head to my next nearest Tesco at Abingdon. Again can t find a childs disabled trolley so go ask at custom service again  to be told there all being repaired. All of them at the same time  leaving me again usable to do my shopping. SO as we are on our way to the John Radcliffe hospital in the afternoon on the same day  I decide to try Cowley Tesco  which big thumbs up to them they had one! Just one mind you though. Only problem with Cowley they don t have the stress free self scan system  which is the only reason o shop at Tesco!! My local Sainsburys always keep there child disable trolley just inside the door  it s always there (unless being used) it s also always dry and clean.					2016-01-15T16:59:04+0000	1452877144	2016-01-15 17:59:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Conveniently  the rest of my family were away from home  leaving myself to unpack the shopping once it arrived. Usually no issue with this apart from I m in my third trimester of pregnancy and have two flights of stairs to my kitchen and eight crates to get through!  Luckily  I had the pleasure of meeting with two of your employees and they offered to bring the shopping into the kitchen and even helped me then place items on the side. It doesn t sound like much  but it s truly and completely made my day.  Please pass on my thanks to them or their manager.

However  the driver was sitting outside in his van for 40mins  but as my time slot wasn t until 16.00-17.00hrs  he would not deliver any earlier.  I am in  and he knows I am in  but he is not allowed to deliver.  This is not the first time this has happened.  Some of the drivers know we don t mind an early delivery if we are at home  but others will not do this as they will get into trouble for delivering outside the time slot.  I know it is the Dot com policy as my husband also delivers for Tesco  and he has explained the rules.  As a customer I find this extremely infuriating.

I was informed recently that if i had my tickets i could use them to get a refund of my taxes. I went to the same store to ask for a tax return ticket and i was told that i need to go to your headquarters. This is unacceptable  every other store that i have visited gives me the receipt right away and now a company as big as yours can t help me.  I have spent over 100 euros at your store and i am going back to the United States tomorrow  i had asked for this ticket more than once at your store but i was told that your system was down. Today a manager told me you can t do this. This is unacceptable and very unprofessional  can t believe i was lied to twice before and now i get this answer.

Forced to tell the unpleasant incident that occurred the evening of 01/13/2015  around 22 pm. The store TESCO EXTRA  GATESHEAD TRINITY SQUARE EXTRA 1 TRINITY SQUARE TURPIN GREEN LANE TYNE AND WEAR NE8 1AG As a result  not much misunderstanding there was a conflict between me and the guard of the store. At the same time I behaved calmly and correctly. Guard behaved inappropriately  and used brute force. I did not make any resistance. Outside shop the guards forbade me to go to the information booth TESCO  to see the phone number of customer support. And most importantly  do not let go to Trinity Square  which is a public area  and it does not belong to Tesco. In addition  three (!) The guard called the police! Apparently  they have decided is not able to deal with a man who does not resist?  Police have not filed charges me. However  as a result of misconduct protection TESCO  I spent a lot of time at the police station! I would like to understand why the guards TESCO bexave is not correct and is not adequate. I am a citizen of the European Union  and in my home country does not use this behavior. This is the behavior of people who work in large and perfect(?) Company  and to be help customers?					2016-01-15T14:13:08+0000	1452867188	2016-01-15 15:13:08	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My eldest son slipped on a wet patch that had not been cleaned or sign posted in the fruit and veg section of the store and the way he landed he dislocated his knee cap!! There were at least 2 members of staff approximately 50-60 meters away who saw this as they made eye contact with me  they chose to walk away rather than help me! I proceeded to carry my 11 year old who was crying uncontrollably in pain while pushing my 2 year old in the pushchair which is not easy to say the least to the cafe in store where I could sit him down to look at his leg!! More staff saw me struggle with my kids and did nothing! I sat him down and proceeded to the pharmacy to get him some painkillers for the pain as he was still crying and still no one helped! After giving him pain relief and a drink I could see the swelling was getting worse so I took him to the hospital again no one helped as I struggled to my car with the kids! I was informed at the hospital my sons knee was dislocated  it is now relocated and he has a full leg brace and is on crutches and 8 lots of painkillers a day! Dealing with your in store staff and head office staff is a waste of time. Not one person asked how my son was or even apologised for what happened I am disgusted in tesco s approach and their customer care or should I say lack of it! My sons godfather works for the national press and if I don t get a suitable resolve I will be publishing an article with photographic evidence in at least 3 of the national papers! My son should have not been injured in that way. But more so I am upset at the way we were treated. It should not be Tesco every little helps it should be Tesco couldn t care less about what happens to you as long as we get your money! I am furious and I expect my son to be compensated for his injury.					2016-01-15T10:21:38+0000	1452853298	2016-01-15 11:21:38	1	26	1	0	27	24	17	7	55	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now on my THIRD one and guess what? It s got to go back AGAIN. What a joke. Defiantly don t recommend these tablets to anyone. And they HAVNT even had the same problem. For a start why on earth sell a  windows tablet  if it doesn t have windows on it. ?!					2016-01-14T21:18:19+0000	1452806299	2016-01-14 22:18:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I then received a text and two emails confirming the items were in store to collect.  Upon collection we were told this was not possible as items were not in store. I come to this page afterwards to make a complaint and get fobbed off with  we ll look into it . I have since been told that the dozy couriers that Tesco use have delivered my urgently needed parcel to a completely different store!!   It has now been well over 24 hours and Tesco have ignored every message sent to them  asking for clarification as to when I can collect my parcel. I am absolutely disgusted with this service! Have waited almost a week for my children to have the pristine uniform that I paid for!!!					2016-01-14T21:15:14+0000	1452806114	2016-01-14 22:15:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She always buys the Carrs table water crackers but in recent weeks they have been out of stock in all the major supermarkets (Tesco  Sainsburys  Morrisons etc).  My mum would like to know if they have been discontinued or if they are simply out of stock  perhaps with some production issue?  Please let me know so I can stop mum grumbling?

I was cooking the risotto and noticed that the chicken is from Thailand!  I then checked the pizza and found the same! I assumed that all chicken products were British  because of your welfare standards? I don t like the idea of eating chicken from Thailand as I am very particular on quality and welfare and also carbon footprints. I am disappointed that I cannot rely on Tesco to match my expectations on these things. I will have to check very carefully in future before I buy  and it may may me less inclined to shop with you which is a shame as i really like my local Tesco.					2016-01-14T19:30:03+0000	1452799803	2016-01-14 20:30:03	5	8	5	0	13	8	4	4	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

My disabled mother got a home delivery on Monday and just because she asked the driver to put her bags inside the door he refused and when asked why  he told her to F off and that he doesn t get paid to carry shopping up stairs (she has stairs going up to her flat) THEN he actually took her shopping away & she was left with no shopping!!!! I have been promised a call back by 3 different people now  2 of them being customer service  managers  as I have called them several times and nobody has bothered to call with any sort of explanation. I am guessing you must think this behaviour is fine. This is an outrage to think you treat your customers like this. The driver is one thing but the fact that you have not even tried to rectify the situation is very very poor! Your customer service is appalling  I will NEVER use tesco delivery again and if someone had bothered to give me some sort of answer for this I wouldn t need to message you on here! I expect a call back ASAP and if I don t get one I m taking this to the top as this is highly unacceptable!!!!!!					2016-01-14T17:32:46+0000	1452792766	2016-01-14 18:32:46	1	14	1	1	16	14	7	7	13	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why have they been out of stock for a week  you have medium and large and girls all sizes but no boys small? We have been using the girls for a week however they dont keep wee in for a boy :-/ 2. Today we popped into a local Morrisons and found said nappies for ¬£3.00 a pack  same nappies  same size etc BUT at only ¬£3.00 - Tesco sell them at ¬£5.20. This price is their normal price NOT a money off deal. Now I understand Tesco do 1/2 price offers however these arent constant and your obv not price checking these. So question is HOW can Morrissons sell them for ¬£2.20 LESS than Tesco?  I am actually disgusted that Tesco are obv charging well over the odds for these essentials.					2016-01-14T14:54:47+0000	1452783287	2016-01-14 15:54:47	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I previously bought my girls grey school tights so they can continue wearing skirts in the colder weather and maintain some dignity as they tend to play more like boys. Due to their playground antics and general wear the older two have holes in all their tights so yesterday I bought them both a triple pack the same sizes as before (9-10 and 11- 12) assuming they would be the same.   On removing them from the packaging they certainly appeared identical having the same size markings on the waist band so thought no more of it and washed them in preparation for this morning. You can imagine my surprise when my eldest complained her new tights didn t fit and so I asked for a demonstration  they looked fine to me until she lifted her skirt to reveal a gusset hanging just higher than the edge of her skirt! As she waddled away to remove the offending item I requested a demonstration from the 9 year old and sure enough the 9-10 tights were just as ill fitting. Being resourceful I advised the 9 year old to wear the new 11-12 tights I had bought for the older child and the eldest to wear the minimally damaged last pair of tights from the first batch.  Once I had taken them to school I decided to have a look at how different the  new  and  old  tights were side by side (unstretched) and amazed at the new 9-10 being 2.5cm narrower at the waist  2.5cm deeper in the gusset and 6.5cm shorter on the inside leg yet the total length remained the same! no wonder it was like putting tights made for a penguin on an Emu.  As I have a 7 year old we have a use for the new 9-10 tights so all is not lost but I now have the inconvenience of having to buy new ones (again) for the 11 year old.					2016-01-14T14:22:58+0000	1452781378	2016-01-14 15:22:58	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

No message by Tuesday night so I ring up and get told that the carrier delivered the hoover to the Cornwall depot  and then by mistake took it back to Hatfield (wherever that is)  then back to Cornwall  where your store refused delivery of it. God knows where it is now.... My order number is 486C8BBFB. I could have gone into town and bought the same thing from Argos for the same price! I thought it was funny to start with but was promised an answer within 48 hours and didn t get one and know I am losing all faith....  Any longer and you will need to send someone round to do my hoovering....					2016-01-14T14:03:06+0000	1452780186	2016-01-14 15:03:06	2	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

A manager took an employee into a corner and was very loudly disciplining  almost shouting at him for what he did wrong with a previous customer in front of other customers. I am not an expert but i am sure that things like this should be discussed in an office away from customers and also is really unprofessional to shout at the staff and theoretically it is abuse at a work place which is against the law. Hope that is not something tesco endorses as a coaching technique.					2016-01-14T13:40:52+0000	1452778852	2016-01-14 14:40:52	44	2	44	1	47	2	2	0	5	0	44	0	0	0	0	0	0

Checked my bank account this morning to find I have been charged twice. I called customer service and they said they needed to check with another department who were not answering. The extra payment they have taken has out me into my overdraft for which I will now be charged ¬£6 a day. When I asked how long my refund would take (once they can actually speak to a department that can tell them I have been charged twice  they don‚Äôt obviously don‚Äôt believe me) I was told it would be 3-5 working days.  I said this was not really good enough as I was now being charged for their error  only to be told ‚Äúthe is nothing I can do about that‚Äù I asked to speak to a manager after another 20 minutes on hold I had to give up and go to work. So I‚Äôm still missing ¬£62 extra from my bank account and being charged ¬£6 a day until Tesco can be bothered to sort this out.					2016-01-14T08:39:46+0000	1452760786	2016-01-14 09:39:46	1	20	1	0	21	19	9	10	11	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went in a few weeks ago and found a shirt I liked  unfortunately didn t have the funds at the time to buy  revisted last week while buying nappies and shirts were still there. Go in today and find only 2 on the shelf  neither my size  fine not a problem  went to ask at the customer service desk to see if they had any other sizes  Lady calls for someone on clothing to come over....10 minutes later she finally comes stomping over and outright says that s the last two they have. Fine  attitude not appreciated but I ll let It go. I go to find my friend who s waiting in clothing for me to return and tell her they didn t even check etc and so she explains she s finally just seen someone working in the fitting room and goes and asks that perfect to be told that no those 2 shirts have apparently been returned from another tesco and they don t have anymore. Normally I could accept that  had I not seen the shelf filled with the exact shirt 2 weeks in a row. So which was it? They d run out or they didn t stock them in the first place?? Completely ridiculous behaviour and lazy attitude. I will not be returning to this store again and maybe not even bother using tesco anymore if this is the service I receive while trying to spend my money. Well done tesco commercial road üëå					2016-01-13T19:56:45+0000	1452715005	2016-01-13 20:56:45	0	22	0	0	22	21	7	14	20	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to the store today specifically to buy SMA cartons for my 10 week old son. As they did not sell the 1litre cartons  I picked up 20 of the 200ml cartons to do him over the next 3 days or so. However  when it came to paying  I was told by an assistant that under no circumstances could I purchase any more than 6 cartons! As someone who always buys the cartons I was very shocked and surprised to hear this. I explained he needs 6 per day and this would be no use to me. The assistant advised me I could not have more than 6 as they were low on stock after not ordering enough. I was absolutely outraged at this  especially as there were at least 60 cartons still on the shelves! I soon realised the assistant was not willing to help me in anyway and I asked to speak with the duty manager...  Keep reading  the best has yet to come....... The duty manager then advised me they DID have a 6 per customer policy in place around a year ago as there was a shortage of SMA in Japan and we may try and send some of our cartons over there! I actually found this reason very comical but then realised that he was being serious. My partner advised the manager that we would be taking this issue further and he quickly told us he would sell us as many as we needed but at this point it was too late. He also offered us ¬£20 but it all just seemed in a vein effort to keep us quiet about the situation. After dealing with the unhelpful assistant  I was left angered and frustrated that I even had to go through that just to buy milk for my son. I have never had an issue like this when shopping in other supermarkets and will now always go elsewhere in future.					2016-01-13T16:27:35+0000	1452702455	2016-01-13 17:27:35	44	43	44	7	94	42	29	13	29	0	44	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am a busy mum of 4 and am lucky enough to have produced some very bright children. The eldest is a clever but cranky teenager that needs encouragement to complrte tasks and meet his full potential.  So as a good mum I thought I would help with the lighting in his study area to make him stay focused. I choose the lovely lamp in the picture below and decided to treat my son. However when I got home I was a little embarrassed as there was no bulb included. (Evidently I m not as bright as my son). Never the less we set it up and the next day I began the hunt for the bulb. As you can imagine I went want to were I got the lamp and they did not have a bulb to fit  I then went to my next nearest Tesco and they had no bulb either. I even went to some of your competitors who id not have the bulb.  So the hunt continues. But why sell the light without the bulb....surely thats not a very bright idea.   	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDLS8q-TOReUmbQ&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftesco.scene7.com%2Fis%2Fimage%2Ftesco%2F205-6383_PI_TPS2310797%3Fwid%3D170%26hei%3D170%26%2524Offers%2524&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQAq3QoEJNw1x4Jg	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBL119XEzkDCVJd&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftesco.scene7.com%2Fis%2Fimage%2Ftesco%2F205-6383_PI_TPS2310797%3Fwid%3D170%26hei%3D170%26%2524Offers%2524&_nc_hash=AQAWVJppsWzZZnkV	http://tesco.scene7.com/is/image/tesco/205-6383_PI_TPS2310797?wid=170&hei=170&%24Offers%24	tesco.scene7.com	2016-01-13T15:37:10+0000	1452699430	2016-01-13 16:37:10	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

After filling up the car started spluttering and stalling almost immediately. I managed to get my car to my local garage and they diagnosed a blocked fuel filter following filling up with fuel at your garage. Now i appreciate that this may be a sheer coincidence but I also feel you should be made aware as this was a very expensive ordeal for myself.					2016-01-13T13:05:23+0000	1452690323	2016-01-13 14:05:23	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sent off for repair again 24th December and we still don t have a working hudl 2 as the courier firm DPD who deliver hudl is useless and fails to deliver to your chosen address even when they confirm that they will deliver there! After speaking to a Tesco manager yesterday evening and him assuring me that he will sort it and arrange for the hudl to be redelivered to my neighbour I think Ok  my son will have a working hudl (after not having it for over 6 weeks). I get a message from DPD to say I have to collect it from store! So I ring Tesco again  the explanation they give is that it was too late for the manager to sort it because it had already been dropped off! Really? So the Hudl has been glitchy since we purchased it but eventually is unusable  switching itself off etc. We send it for repair and get it back with the exact same fault! We follow all of the instructions with regards to parcel delivery and yet it is us that have to keep chasing! I now have to wait another week for it to be collected by DPD and delivered to where it should have been delivered in the first instance! I think such a large company as Tesco can and should do better! Your product was faulty  your repair didn t work so the service repair firm you use is obviously not fit for purpose and the delivery company they use is even worse! Word of advice for anyone thinking of purchasing a Hudl 2  DON T BOTHER!					2016-01-13T11:00:38+0000	1452682838	2016-01-13 12:00:38	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Getting out of the house is often an achievement in itself. I often do my shopping at Tesco in Purley but lately there are a few things that are putting me off going here. First of all it is always difficult to get a parent and child space. All of these spaces are right near the store entrance and are frequently abused by non parents. Why do these need to be close to the store? It opens them up for abuse and as a mum I need a wide space not necessarily proximity to the door. Secondly trolleys for twins are practically non existent. My twins are not babies so need proper seats. The trolleys with 2 seats in are often mixed in with the single seat trolleys and are therefore inaccessible. When asking for help from the trolley attendant  he was rude and unhelpful. I can t be the only person wanting a trolley with 2 seats. It would be helpful if these were kept separate from the single seat trolleys. Special trolleys for babies are able to be kept separate. Often I have to leave the children in the car whilst I try to find a trolley. Last time this was a good 5 minutes. Both these things add up to a less than easy shopping experience and I d appreciate hearing your thoughts.					2016-01-12T20:35:04+0000	1452630904	2016-01-12 21:35:04	1	3	1	0	4	3	3	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

You should be proud! Also  I couldn t have picked fresher produce myself! I was saying to a friend in work how we used to get home deliveries  but found the use by dates were only 1 or 2 days which was no good for a weekly shop.

I purchased a coat for my daughter this morning from Tesco Prestwich and they didn t take the electronic tag off it (in fact thinking back they didn t even check for one).  My daughter who wasn t with me at the time tried it on at home and discovered the tag.  As she had a train to catch back to university we took the coat to the nearest Tesco - Cheetham Hill who were so incredibly rude and dismissive insisting they couldn t take the tag off and it wasn t their problem.  The security guard was talking to one of the customer service assistants and they made it very clear that we were interrupting their inane chat.  I ve had to send my daughter away with a coat with a tag on and no coat to wear.  Given our shop at Tesco was approx 30% more expensive than Aldi (which we now use regularly) I d have thought that some of the extra cash could be spent on training your staff in basic customer service.					2016-01-12T15:02:17+0000	1452610937	2016-01-12 16:02:17	2	14	2	1	17	14	4	10	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner had suggested to get lunch in the cafe whilst we waited for his prescription to be sorted. Half way through the chilli and chips I had ordered  I bit into something hard  I then pulled a STAPLE from my mouth. A staple that had come from the food served to me on your premises by your staff. We immediately told staff  15 minutes passed before we were refund for my meal. The staff were brilliant and apologised profusely but how is a refund for an inedible meal adequate for almost swallowing a staple? I then contacted customer services via email and asked for an email reply regarding the incident. My mobile number has been passed to 3 different numbers. I did not give permission for my mobile number to be handed out at will! I am extremely upset with how tesco have dealt with this and will not be using any of your stores again and post this to warn others not to eat at any of your cafes as food is evidentially contaminated with metal!					2016-01-12T12:33:07+0000	1452601987	2016-01-12 13:33:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wish to raise a ridiculous anomaly in your Tesco Instant Oats Porridge Pot pricing.  I regularly buy mine from either your Tower Park or Fleetsbridge branches in Poole at 49p per pot.  The other evening to save time  I though I d walk to your  convenience  store in Broadstone.  It takes me the same time to walk there as it does to drive to the Fleetsbridge one so it s neither convenient nor inconvenient to be honest. Anyway  I digress.  So  it was to my astonishment that the exact same pot costs a staggering 83p at your convenience stores.  What s convenient about that?  A 69% increase in price for taking the healthier option of walking to buy my porridge.  Who says keeping fit needn t cost?  Must I assume that there are other ridiculous pricing anomalies in your convenience stores?  I am currently 68p out of pocket.  Perhaps you d like to give me a refund. After all  every little helps.

I have just had a confirmation email to let me know that it is available to collect. I clicked on the link to double check it is the correct item and it is now ¬£10 !!! I m obviously going to cancel the item i paid ¬£20 for  wait for the refund and then buy this same item again for ¬£10. Is there an easier way to get it today for teh reduced price of ¬£10? My local Tescos has no toy department so the original ¬£20 item is going to be sat tehre then sent back then the same item is going to be delivered there for me again in a few days time! Does that make sense? Basically to save us both alot of time and hassle can i just collect the item that is there now for ¬£10?. I have private messaged you aswell with the store and item number.

As she didn t have an account with you i offered to place the order for her and collect it for her as our local store is alot closer to me than her.   The party was 9th Jan and we ordered the food the weekend before as most of the items asked for 3 working days notice we thought this would be plenty of time. We did click and collect for between 8am and 10am as I had arranged to meet my friend at the venue for 10am to set things up and the venue had kindly agreed to store the food in their kitchen until needed.  8am on the morning of the party I had a phone call from the Shepton Mallet store saying that 4 items of the order hadn t arrived but they had been told it would arrive on the 9am delivery to the store. I explained this was ok as I was planning on picking the order up at 9.30am and agreed with the member of staff that she would call as soon as the delivery arrived to let me know. 9.30 came and no phone call so I called the number I was provided to be told that the lorry had been delayed and was due at 10am. I explained I was due to meet my friend at 10am but said I could collect shortly after then and let my friend know I would be late.  10am came and went and I got a call at 10.30 explaining my missing order was due in at midday on another lorry. I explained this was not good enough as i had to be at the venue and the Shepton Mallet staff arranged for the order to be delivered to the venue free of charge as soon as it arrived. Luckily the party was an evening event not a lunchtime do.   At midday I called for an update and was told it would arrive in the Shepton store at 1.30pm and I became very doubtful that the missing order would arrive at all and myself and my friend were planning on visiting the local supermarkets to the venue to get sandwiches as these were the missing items from my order. The Shepton staff were very apologetic and said they would keep me updated.   I then received a call at 1pm saying the order would be arriving at 2.30pm I was not pleased to say the least and my friend was becoming more and more stressed as she had 50+ guests arriving that evening with no sandwiches to serve. The shepton staff said they would let me know as soon as my order was in the store and when a driver would be coming to deliver. I explained the order had to be with us before 3.30 at the latest otherwise we would have to find alternative sandwiches from the local supermarkets.  At 3pm I recieve a call saying the sandwiches had arrived and were being delivered and would be with me in 30mins. And at 3.30 the manager Mike personally delivered the items and was very apologetic explaining that they use a 3rd party to make the sandwiches and they had processed the order incorrectly.  I can safely say that your  easy  entertainment service is anything but easy and more like a stressful nightmare that made an already stressful day more stressful! My friend now wishes she had used Marks and Spencer service and we will never be using your service again.   I would like to thank the staff at the Shepton Mallet store for all their hard work in tracking my order and personally delivering it in their lunch break but I would like Tesco to consider a full refund for the amount of stress you caused us which damped what should of been a happy day.

When i checked your brand match guarantee online i noticed that they are not comparing items that were comparing in my previous shop 2 days ago.

I had paid for it in part cash part vouchers. I was refunded the cash and told the vouchers would be refunded too but this may take a while. It s now almost the middle of January and I still don t seem to have had this done. Is there anyway somebody can check this out for me?

He has been a regular customer of your stores for many years. Recently he had problems with his television that he bought from your store. Phoned customer services  was given a reference number  told that it was still under guarantee and was told that he would be contacted by post telling him when he could go into store  take the damaged television and get a replacement........... This was before Christmas. Following many conversations with the Mold store and customer services he has finally been told today that what he was promised previously was a load of rubbish. He was passed onto a manager who it sounds like has fobbed him off. This from one of the largest retail companies in Britain! Disgusting! You ve left a retired pensioner without a television during the cold season with false hope that it was eventually to be sorted  only to hear today that he had been falsely mislead and then had the cheek to ask him for ¬£10.00 for a copy of the phone recordings. I suggest you take this matter seriously or the complaint will be escalated to a larger body which is going to cost you more in the long run!					2016-01-11T21:04:47+0000	1452546287	2016-01-11 22:04:47	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I work in your Haslemere branch and I was wondering if you could answer a question for me...  *drum roll*  Okay...so here s the Million Dollar Question...  A question that nobody at work has been able to answer.  Do you need to ID people if they re buying non-alcoholic beer?  It doesn t come up with an age prompt on the screen and to all intents and purposes it is a soft drink.  So are we allowed to sell non-alcoholic beer to minors?  It s been bugging me for weeks!					2016-01-11T20:47:08+0000	1452545228	2016-01-11 21:47:08	0	9	0	0	9	9	2	7	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I was leaving the car park I was sitting at the roundabout and my car broke down wouldn t start so I couldn t move it. Luckily my mum was with me and I had my 1 year old daughter was in the car and I was late for picking up my son from playgroup. 2 guys helped push it back Into the petrol station out of the way as it was blocking the road for everyone to get out. But unknown to me we pushed it onto the fuel tanker bit. By this time the guys had gone. My mum went into the fuel station to let them know the situation but the member of staff was extremely rude and she wasent interested that my car was broken down all she cared about was that I had to get my car moved as tesco would get charged if the tanker can t get in! I was stressed enough as I was on the phone trying to get my son picked up didn t need her rudeness! She also accused my mum of telling her to shut her peep well I can tell you now that did not happen. My mum couldn t get a word in as the member of staff was too interest in getting charged I the tanker came! Eventually she did phone down to the store and 3 manager guys helped push it out the way and they were laughing at me I wasent very amused! And I don t think I will be back to tesco after the horrible customer care!					2016-01-11T20:27:51+0000	1452544071	2016-01-11 21:27:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The time was shortly before 10am and staff were heading down onto the shop floor and to the tills ready to start serving customers at 10am.  NINE members of staff walked passed pieces of cardboard in the middle of the aisle.  NINE of them.  They even walked around the cardboard but not one of them had the gumption to pick it up off the floor.  I had to go back to that aisle a few minute later and a staff member had moved his trolley full of cardboard OVER it instead of picking it up.  Shocking.  Hope no one actually fell on that piece of card or tripped on it.					2016-01-11T16:49:23+0000	1452530963	2016-01-11 17:49:23	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I normally spend around ¬£127 in Tesco on a normal weekly shop! Not quite sure how your brand match guarantee (that you so proudly boast about on your awful adverts with that awful  acting ) works because the brands I brought today in Sainsbury were definitely cheaper than Tesco!? I d urge all of your loyal customers (like I was) to shop elsewhere for a week and see how they re being ripped off for their loyalty.

My daughter fell over just as we entered the shop and cut open her lip  there was a lot of blood and even more tears (from the both of us). A number of staff went out of their way to help (including staff I believe were finishing shifts and/or off duty)... getting a toy from your toy department to try and cheer up my daughter; keeping my 7month old son occupied in the trolley while I was looking after my daughter; administering first aid; offering to get any urgent shopping for me before I left the shop; and helping me back to my car as I had to carry my daughter. I really hope you are able to get this message back to them  as all the help didn t go unnoticed. My daughter and I were a bit shaken by it  but your staff did an amazing job to make sure we were all OK and couldn t have been more helpful and calm in such a horrible situation.

If he didn t eat gluten free food my husband would be seriously ill - this remark just shows that your food staff are completely ignorant to food intolerance   Luckily my husband laughed saying the Doncaster cafe reminded him of an episode of  The Royal Family  - wafer thin ham ...

My chocolate hazelnut spread & my ready salted crisps...!!  I usually stick to the branded goodies  we all know who i m talking about here...... but on my last shop i tried your products..! I have to say i found them both  not only matching in quality to the others but surpassing them in every way.!! The spread   in my opinion is better as it spreads easily onto the bread straight from the jar even when its cold..... making for a more enjoyable breakfast experience..!!  The crisps are far tastier than your rivals too..! And  BONUS.... both products cost less... saving me money... ill definitely be buying these products again on my shop with you in the future..!

My daughter bought a hudl 2 from the Blue Boar Lane shop in Norwich in June. It was with her birthday money  so was paid for in cash. It no longer charges and I have a very upset 9 year old.   My problem is  I can t find the receipt so am wondering if there is any way Tesco can find a record of the purchase so that the hudl can be repaired? As it is still under a year old  it is still under warranty.  I would be really grateful if someone could help.  Many thanks.

I can t be bothered to return them to my local Tesco Express as the customer service there is so awful it would be more effort than it s worth. And the fiscal worth of said custard creams is 40p. However I am annoyed enough that it passed quality control to post this. Not just one custard cream is burnt. The whole packet is. Custard creams should never brown should they? Just yellow. Well the edges of these are brown. Distinctly so. I won t be buying again as I ve just discovered Lidyl s custard creams are much nicer. Creamier biscuit  more cream inside the sandwich and not as yet burnt/brown/overdone. Call it what you will. And cheaper. Its a small thing really but there again it s the small things that matter and show you care. And therewith the real problem Tesco - I just don t believe you do care anymore.					2016-01-11T00:01:08+0000	1452470468	2016-01-11 01:01:08	1	11	1	0	12	11	3	8	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I found this out this morning with our Daughters iPod. The iPod would not charge  plugged in only to feel a voltage of the back of the metal casing when plugged into the wall. Have been in touch with tesco and are replacing but there was no concern regarding the fault. Not helpful really considering people may get electrocuted.					2016-01-10T21:27:56+0000	1452461276	2016-01-10 22:27:56	0	2	0	1	3	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I saw an LG sound bar  however having my three year old daughter  a basket of shopping and being 8months pregnant there was no way I could manage that as well! Harry not only went to check if there was another one as the one on display had been opened  as there wasn t  so he offered to try and tape it back up after checking everything was in there. He then carried it to the customer service till so I could pay for it  then waited with me whilst I completed my Scan and Shop purchase  but carried it out and loaded in to my car too.  Please pass this on to his manager  and take this in to consideration for any Employee of the month/customer service bonus scheme you may have.					2016-01-10T19:44:42+0000	1452455082	2016-01-10 20:44:42	3	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can understand Tesco charging for the items to be delivered to our front door but it s wrong to charge us for an item that may already be on the shop floor.  I ve spent a lot of money with Tesco but after this I very much doubt I will use click and collect in future when I can get the same items reserved at Argos for free. I feel many others will follow because this is a step too far and you are wrong.					2016-01-10T19:25:22+0000	1452453922	2016-01-10 20:25:22	4	8	4	0	12	8	3	5	9	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

As the Duck was in a  roasting bag  it was very difficult to assess the quality of the bird that we were buying  and as a consequence what we ended up with appeared to be 90% bone and cartilage and although the remaining 10% was tasty enough  the claim that it serves 2-3 people is laughable. (Also if you followed the cooking instructions on the bag  then the  cooked  duck could probably be brought round by a skilled vet.... yes I know duck is supposed to be pink.... but even with an extra 10 mins it was still running red).  Won t be buying that again that s for sure.					2016-01-10T19:10:14+0000	1452453014	2016-01-10 20:10:14	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

All the above products did not have the minimum number of days left on the use by date as promised on the online shopping site. I ve already had a refund for the whole chicken and the mince but have only just discovered the Chinese chicken went out of date on the 8th when I went to make sandwich for work tomorrow with it. It is pointless me having my shopping delivered when I now still have to go out and do shopping to replace these items. I shouldn t have to check the dates on my entire shop I should be able to trust Tescos advertised number of days left fresh.

Tesco denied they were negligent. The trolley bay was missing plastic sides and roof and the trolley man told my mother he d warned manager about it  the manager just claimed act of God then taped off said trolley bay so obviously was an issue. So my parents both OAPs are now left with being out of pocket  they ve contacted head office after being fobbed off by manager at store. But reply showed they weren t even interested in reading the complaint and just waffled usual rubbish  and obviously never read complaint properly as their reply didn t involve what had actually happened. And a phone call after the reply resulted in more being fobbed off. The incident was witnessed by someone and they kindly took pictures. Luckily my mother wasn t putting shopping in car at time or a child was walking past. But tesco don t care					2016-01-10T17:46:05+0000	1452447965	2016-01-10 18:46:05	3	9	3	3	15	4	3	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only today I had an extra surprise from tesco - 5kg of granulated sugar I hadn t ordered. Wouldn t have been an issue only it wasn t in its bag  it was spread all through my bags of shopping! I m still unclear as to why the delivery driver thought it was ok to deliver my shopping totally covered in sugar. What should have been a simple 5 minute transaction of taking my groceries at the door turned into 20 minutes of hunt the food items not totally covered in sugar. My shopping is delivered in bags  every single bag had to be checked  all shopping removed  sugar removed (if it could be  as you are probably aware sugar granules get everywhere) and where the sugar couldn t be removed I gave back the items. Which then meant my husband having to go shopping to get these items  defeating the object of having my shopping delivered! Maybe if it was a couple of bags I wouldn t of minded  but this was ¬£100 worth of groceries  a weeks worth of shopping for our family. The shopping I did accept needed wiping down as it was all sticky  as I m sure you can appreciate this breeds germs  not what I want on my children s food items  especially my 8month old baby s food and my 2 year old who has short bowel syndrome and isn t allowed to have sugar of any kind. When questioned where the sugar had come from the delivery driver we were told the shopping above ours in transit had become damaged. While i understand that things like this can happen (although in all my years of shopping I have never come across exploding bags of sugar) I am totally shocked that this shopping would still be delivered to us  the only alternative given was to return the whole shop which would have meant going to the store ourselves. I don t do internet shopping because I m too lazy to leave my house  in fact there are times I m happy to come to the store to do it while my husband keeps the kids at home as it gives me time out! But I do the majority of my shopping online as with 2 autistic children and a baby time is of the essence! Having to spend nearly an hour in total cleaning the groceries of all the sugar and hoovering the carpet thought out the house where the sugar had escaped was not the best way for me to spend my time today! We asked if it had been a sticky drink eg a bottle of Coke that had spilt all over our shopping would it still be delivered and the answer was yes!!! Shocking!!! Maybe you need to address this issue and until I am assured this won t happen again I ll be taking my custom to asda!					2016-01-10T17:37:26+0000	1452447446	2016-01-10 18:37:26	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I contacted tesco Mobile to say that unless I connect through wifi at home I get no access to the internet. I was advised that tesco use O2 masts and that there is only 2G in my area and that my phone is only use for making/receiving texts and calls. If I had been advised of this I would have stayed with EE who provide excellent coverage. I asked to cancel my contract as it is no use to me and was told that it would cost me ¬£480. The lady apologised and offered me ¬£30 credit which I refused. In my opinion these contracts are being missold and I will be taking further advise about my rights.					2016-01-10T17:15:49+0000	1452446149	2016-01-10 18:15:49	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been shopping in the tesco branch today. The week before last I bought a packet of sweet potatoes. Mid week when i opened them they were full of a vinegary fluid so i threw them away  i didnt bother following it up as thought it was a one off. Last week I bought a packet of sweet potatoes which when i got out of the cupboard in the middle of the week had gone off before the best before date. I brought these into the store today to the customer service desk. I was advised that I should have opened the packet straight away before putting them in the cupboard. I asked if this was advised on the packet and they said yes (afterwards i checked and it does not say this - only to store in a cool dry place). They refunded the potatoes anyway which I brought in but would not refund from the week before.                                   Please can you clarify your policy in relation to faulty/ off goods as I have been receiving conflicting information. I don t really see why I should make a trip out of the way to bring in off veg when its going to cost me time and petrol money to replace. I didn t find the attitude of the Skipton staff at the customer service desk very helpful. Many thanks.					2016-01-10T17:08:24+0000	1452445704	2016-01-10 18:08:24	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered an electronics package on Friday 8th  on the promise that it ll be available for pick-up in my nearest store the next day after 3pm. I came to the store today (leaving you an extra 24 hours to deliver it just in case)  and the package was nowhere to be found. The owner had no idea where it could be and I had to call two different customer services number from my own phone to be told that my package  may arrive in the next 24 to 48 hours but we can t be sure . So nobody could tell me with certainty where my package was. When this is an order of more than ¬£50  I think it s unacceptable that you can t have a clearer tracking service  let alone that you are more than 24h late on the promised delivery slot. I needed this package for professional purposes and now I have to rearrange my schedule because of this. Why do you send me an email saying my order is available to collect from the store when it isn t? Why do you promise next-day delivery when your systems and processes are clearly not smooth enough to deliver on that? I hope you can understand my frustration.

I did mention on this page before about the Basildon tesco  s ranges disappearing rapidly range   which I had been told would be looked into  but since asking the store myself I have been told that the vegetarian section in Langdon hills is now one door only (hence sausages) and will stay that way and it looks like the mayflower is going the same way!  Asda has a full range of Quorn products including the vegan range!

June last year I was told I had a dairy intolerance which was a huge shock and very difficult to change my diet at a click of a finger.  I wasn t going to let this get the better of me but I realised I had to make a lot of changes. I have been using your free from range which helped a lot  but recently my local store  Loughborough have moved the free from range into a corner of the store  it is never stocked up and on the last three visits haven t had any of the products I buy week in week out and it s a total mess.   I have visited my nearest asda and sainsburys to discover they have so much more to choose from but are more expensive than you and I have to travel further. I don t want to change where I shop and want to know why this department is not seen as important to you as a company as it is to those who suffer with food allergies.   We need to eat like everybody else From a very concerned customer					2016-01-10T15:18:04+0000	1452439084	2016-01-10 16:18:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called up in December to pay off (and I quote)  what I owed  in order to clear my card  and then close my credit card as I have a better deal else where. The girl I spoke to was helpful  I paid off the amount she said in full  she said she d close the account now paid off  and that was it. A week or so later  I received a letter confirming the credit card account was closed.  Great!  Until the beginning of this week! ¬£200 came out of our bank account to Tesco credit card  so I called to say it s a mistake- but was then told that no  this wasn t a mistake and I actually had ¬£300+ still on the card from transactions not accounted for between 17th November and the date I called to close the account on the 15th December. The card had bot been used for a week before my call.  At no point on my payment phone call was I told there may be outstanding transactions to still pay  at no point was I told that the account could be closed with remaining balances to pay  at no point was I told that there was a  blind spot  equivalent amount of time which meant that the figure I was told was untrue!!!!!  So  as you can imagine  after paying off my initial FULL balance as I wanted to  we enjoyed Christmas and relaxed  we bought a new mattress as we had some available funds to do so  we were able to get a few extra people presents....... And now  we have this new balance  we weren t told of  that we would have happily paid off at the time had we been told about it  and no longer have the money for.  I am truly upset by the lack of communication  the lack of help from the team when I called up about it  and the lack of responsibility taken on Tesco s part for  surprising  us with a bill we had specifically tried to pay off before Christmas.  I hope you can understand why this is so upsetting. We had every intention to settle whatever we owed  and did so to our knowledge  and now  have been stung!   I hope someone on here is able to shed light on this stressful situation  and some responsibility taken and compromise on the final bill due to the lack of information given on the original call.  Yours sincerely   Laura Goodesmith					2016-01-10T14:16:17+0000	1452435377	2016-01-10 15:16:17	4	17	4	2	23	17	13	4	6	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I emailed tesco photo support and another was sent out immediately which was great and excellent customer service. However  on receipt I was really disappointed with the quality  the picture was quite blurry. I emailed on the 7 December to feed back and received no response so sent another email on the 24 December and to date have still received no response  not even an acknowledgement. The frustrating thing is I tried to upload the original photo taken by a professional wedding photographer at our wedding so the quality was perfect  however your site wouldn t permit the upload saying the file was too large so I had to reduce it in order that I could upload and get the canvas. I wanted to know if there was a way I could send the original photo and get a non blurry canvas print. The canvas was a gift for a family member of one of our wedding photos so quite special and unfortunately it just doesn t feel very special anymore. I don t like resorting to social media with my query but I m getting no response to email and there s no phone number to call. Really hoping you can assist please. Thank you.					2016-01-10T11:17:01+0000	1452424621	2016-01-10 12:17:01	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The lady at the checkout was clearly ill  a hacking spluttering cough and sneezing everywhere. Whilst I appreciate her commitment to work  I do not think it s appropriate that she coughs and sneezes and splutters all over my shopping. No hand gel  nothing. Coughing and sneezing into her hands and over my shopping. What might hopefully just be a cold for her could turn into something a lot worse for other people. Whilst I appreciate that people often come into contact with germs there is a big difference between casual contact and someone spluttering coughing and sneezing all over your food.

Had a 6-7pm slot and turned up at 8.07pm. No answer from the store it was coming from  no call back to explain where it was (as promised from your Groceries helpline).  On a previous delivery  the driver was a few minutes late and had the decency to call to say he was running late due to traffic.  I wasn t here when the shopping was delivered  and my partner wasn t too pleased with just the  sorry I am running late  reply he got when asked why he was an hour late.					2016-01-10T10:05:05+0000	1452420305	2016-01-10 11:05:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I complained to the Chief Executive. They tried to fob me off with a goodwill gesture from one of their Executive Response team. They cancelled an order I placed with them without telling me. Then they tried to blame it on the Government  when they knew this was not true. Then they tried to say I didn t have a valid contract with them. Don t trust them. They overstated their accounts so why wouldn t they cheat their customers.					2016-01-10T00:35:52+0000	1452386152	2016-01-10 01:35:52	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed a wine order with them for a get-together I was having on New Year s Eve. They didn t deliver the order and then blamed it on the Government because they said they weren t allowed to sell wine below minimum alcohol pricing levels. I wrote to them and proved that the price I paid was above minimum pricing levels.Then they said I didn t have a valid contract with them because  according to their terms and conditions  they don t recognize a contract until a product has been dispatched. I told them I have a screenshot which showed the wine had been dispatched. I told them they can t have it both ways. (1) Either they dispatched the wine  in which case I had a valid contract  or (2) They knowingly provided me with untrue information when they said the wine had been dispatched when they knew they had cancelled the order. Either way  they have acted dishonestly. They are still refusing to honour the deal. I bought the wine at ¬£2.75 per bottle. They are now selling it at ¬£7 per bottle. This is the real reason they won t honour my contract. I think they made a mistake on their website and now they are trying to get out of fulfilling their contractual obligations. They mis-priced the wine. My wife waited in all day for a delivery they knew wouldn t arrive. They offered me a goodwill gesture   but I don t want that. I want them to honour the deal. Don t trust Tesco. They falsified their accounts  so why should I be surprised that they will cheat their customers. Cowboys. I don t need to save a few quid. This is a point of principle. I don t like being cheated by charlatans like these.					2016-01-10T00:26:40+0000	1452385600	2016-01-10 01:26:40	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

From the well presented butcher s counter we thought we d treat ourselves and have a couple of pieces of sirloin from the Finest range.   The steaks on offer looked great but had a large knuckle of fat on one end. No problem though  we thought we d just ask the butcher (who was very obliging) to trim the fat off and thereby only charge us for the price of the meat we d be taking home.   Alas no. The butcher rather embarrassingly said that whilst he could trim the steaks  he d still have to charge us for the weight of the fat that obviously was going in the bin.   So  the two steaks which should have cost us roughly ¬£10 ended up costing ¬£14.19.   So I guess Every Little really does Help...... inflate your profits Tesco  when you charge people for the extra weight of meat fat that goes in the bin.  Still  the steaks did taste good I suppose.

Have been waiting patiently for my shopping to arrive at my allocated slot of 6-7pm. This was a delivery that I paid for as it seems you don t offer free delivery. 7pm came and went with no delivery and no contact to inform me what was happening. I finally received a text at 7.15 to say my delivery would now be delivered any time up until 8.59pm. Pretty shocking service and have now resorted to ordering a take away...shall I sent you the ¬£28 bill? Lesson learned and shall use sainsburys from now on. Should I also expect a refund on the delivery charge that u paid for the 6-7pm slot?					2016-01-09T20:38:10+0000	1452371890	2016-01-09 21:38:10	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called and was told it could be delivered the next day late in the afternoon - I booked a certain time slot because I needed my shopping then not the following day - I expressed my concern to the Tesco operative that the money may have been taken from my card for this shopping  which he assured me would not have happened - I telephoned my bank to be told yes Tesco had taken the money!  I phoned Tesco back to be told yes they had taken it  but it would be refunded in 3-5 days!!!! So not only did I have to go shopping  when I hadnt planned to  that night   thats why I have my shopping delivered as I find it difficult to get to the supermarket  I have also paid twice  once for the Tesco cancelled order and once for the replacement shopping  which I bought from an alternative supermarket  for the record - I now have to wait for my refund  which when you live on a tight budget is a huge inconvenience  as all my money is spoken for and I cannot afford to be out of pocket for this  interim  time!! Lets just say I wont be using Tesco Groceries on line again!!!					2016-01-09T19:09:24+0000	1452366564	2016-01-09 20:09:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having to argue with a member of staff when it was their actions that caused the error. Not often that the customer remains calm and the member of staff escalates the situation. Standards are slipping and you won t keep your customers like that.					2016-01-09T18:58:15+0000	1452365895	2016-01-09 19:58:15	6	9	6	1	16	9	9	0	6	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

As we left the store (¬£62.36 lighter) the alarms went off. I stopped  embarrassed  and waited for the security guard to approach me. He asked to see my receipt as I looked through my trolley to see what it might have been. I handed him a pyjama set that d I d bought as I saw it still had a security tag on; he took it from me  went to removed the tag and handed it back with no hint of an apology. The fact that I was made to feel/look like a criminal has left me feeling upset and angry  my 11 year old daughter also also felt distressed by the incident. Surely till staff should be trained to removed security tags to avoid such incidences and security staff trained to deal with such occurrences more sensitively with an apology at the very least?					2016-01-09T18:32:45+0000	1452364365	2016-01-09 19:32:45	0	10	0	0	10	6	3	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They must be freezing!  It regularly floods along there (making use of the P&C bays and access to the store difficult) but today it s worse than I ve ever seen it.  When you re running from car to store with hood up and head down you don t often see the flooding until you re ankle deep in water!  Might be worth getting someone to take a look at at the drainage there as this happens every time we get heavy rain.					2016-01-09T15:54:13+0000	1452354853	2016-01-09 16:54:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last night at 6pm when I arrived home there was nothing on my doorstep.  This morning at around 8 am when I opened my front door somebody have left the tesco delivery in the rain on my doorstep. Nobody knocked. Nobody even attempted to let us know they were delivering this parcel. Just put it down in the rain and walked away despite the fact it clearly was not a waterproof parcel.  If it was laid against the door it would not have been soaked.  The mind boggles. And it appears now that I am unable to actually get into contact with Max Spielmann because there is no customer service number and the button to press to go to e-mail them does not allow me to do anything.  So the gift I ordered is ruined.   I have tried to dry it but I think it is a lost cause.  The product is sold under the Tesco brand therefore I would like my complaint to be acknowledged by yourselves and please to get in touch with me.					2016-01-09T14:30:14+0000	1452349814	2016-01-09 15:30:14	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I made my partner s first and as he went into the living room to eat his  i continued with cooking my own. I wasn t even half way through cooking my bacon when my partner called to me saying that it didn t taste right.. I tried his roll and immediately spat it out..it tasted of washing up liquid. We checked the eggs and the bacon  both tasted fine  then we tried the rolls..once again immediately spat it out  they tasted vile. Checking the date on the rolls  they went out of date yesterday  the day they were delivered. I then checked the other pack of 6 rolls  they go out of date today!! I am absolutely disguted!

Iv just had a big argument with someone who s parked in one of the parent and toddler bays when they had no kids with them. Fortunately we did manage to get another bay as we had our 6 month old baby with us but iv been told that if there aren t any parent bays available we could use the disabled bays as there seems to be a lot more disabled then parent bay s. Is this the case as any parent would agree trying to get a child out the car in the smaller normal bays is a struggle and could potentially cause damage to the cars. And if you could answer why there always seems to be dozens of disabled bay s  and half of them seem to be empty but only a few parent bays that are always full. Thanks for your help and advice.					2016-01-09T13:09:41+0000	1452344981	2016-01-09 14:09:41	2	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

If one of the fundraisers asks me to support their campaign and i politely decline  I expect to be left alone after that  not have a load of questions directed at me  I dont expect to have to justifiy myself to some pushy  young guy who is doing it for the commission he gets for himself from the PDSA as happened today. Nobody wants pushy little salesmen  especially when your store in St Leonards  East Kilbride seems to have a couple of different charity canvassers  every week. Not all are like him tho. Anyway its food for thought. I understand charities need to make money - but hassling  guilt tripping and the like will just send your hard earned customers elsewhere and trust me  theres plenty of alternatives!					2016-01-09T13:06:36+0000	1452344796	2016-01-09 14:06:36	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

Making shopping easier for adults with autism and parents of children with autism is  I believe  very important. Doing so also fits in with a number of the Big Six measures. So who should I contact with my thoughts and ideas?					2016-01-09T11:29:53+0000	1452338993	2016-01-09 12:29:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was assured by the lady that I spoke to that the store the delivery came from would contact me in 24 hours. I have heard nothing! I have a 3 month old baby & the last thing I need is extra things to do (like scrubbing the carpet!) The marks have faded  but not completely gone  after a lot of effort!

I was told there was nothing that could be done as the gift card number was untraceable. Feeling deflated I went back to the store and asked at customer services who told me they wouldn t even be able to go back far enough on the system to find the receipt. I did my shopping and tried my luck once more at checkouts  your till supervisor ( Rob I think his name was ) was the first person I spoke to who really knew the system  within 5 minutes he had gone through the till system and found the original receipt  printed it and the gift card number out  so happy with the service! It s a shame that the people higher up at head office and customer services were unaware that this could even be done.

I would like to support this request and you could be the first company to help all these parents in need. Often special needs children are still not dry until later in their little lives. Often they need larger size nappies. Sometimes the NHS will provide these but not in all cases. How wonderful it would be if a large company like Tesco would support these families. Not only would the parents be grateful but I m sure the newspapers would give you praise for your community spirit. PLEASE help.

And to top it off the high chairs were dangerous as all the screws were very lose when they should be inspected daily!!!! And there were parts missing when I inform the staff the attitude was   oh really  and seemed to find it funny. When the panini eventually arrived it was pretty much thrown on to the table and she then stormed off mumbling will not be using this cafe again until standards have been raised as it was completely unacceptable  especially when parents expect the high chairs to be safe!!!! I hope other parents read this and avoid that cafe!!!					2016-01-09T08:42:13+0000	1452328933	2016-01-09 09:42:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I don t have the receipt  I live in Surrey and when I unpacked the cooker after returning home from our Christmas I threw away the box .  So last night having spent a small four tune buying all kinds of wired and wonderful ingredients to make a chicken Rohan kwarmi curry  I thought I d cut down the 3 hr cooking time and put it in my pressure cooker! Genius!!!  I thought the litre valve on the top seemed very loose but didn t think much off it so had the cooker on for 30 min turn off built up to courage to let out the steam(had visions in my head of it exploding and ripping a huge gaping hole in my face or ceiling) tried to let out the steam...  And nothing no pressure release so I left it 15-20 min and attempted to get the lip off ... And couldn t this was at 7.30pm yesterday evening ... Both myself and my husband tried using brute force to get the bloody lid off but failed miserably! And so the bloody this is still holding what I m assuming to be the best curry I ve ever made hostage! Mean while we had to eat a plain nann   and chocolate chunk and hazelnut cookies (with milk obviously) for dinner! I would like to exchange my cooker for a less hostile one please					2016-01-09T07:53:43+0000	1452326023	2016-01-09 08:53:43	2	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We paid a visit to the Tesco Metro right across from the Arndale and we were blown away with the customer service! We have no idea what the guys name was but we were upstairs talking amongst ourselves about how we thought the shop was small with only one floor (we hadnt realised there was a downstairs) and we couldn t find any oat biscuits and out of nowhere he turned to us and said he hears everything and said he had oat biscuits downstairs. Not only did he walk us downstairs but he walked us straight to the oat biscuits in their aisle. On the way down the escalator he could see we were struggling with all the products in our hands and before we could say we needed a basket out of nowhere he produced a basket! He was genuinely so helpful and so friendly and so nice we just had to say how thankful we were! We couldn t have been happier with the service we received! Thank you so much your staff is amazing :-)					2016-01-08T23:05:22+0000	1452294322	2016-01-09 00:05:22	3	2	3	0	5	2	1	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today i traveled on the 1100 am Fife Coastliner 95 to St Andrews. the double-decker bus conveying some 20 souls was forced to make an unscheduled stop as a result of the activities of a tesco delivery van. Rather than back up a few yards the tesco employee leisurely delivered two green boxes to a residence and finally allowed the bus to continue. On arrival in st andrews i visited the Tesco Metro to inquire about company policy. the manager was extremely courteous however was unable to offer any resolution for he explained the internet division was outwith his control. could i inquire threw this page company policy on Community relations. My current experience lends me to the belief that Tesco Core Values are a moveable feast.					2016-01-08T22:15:43+0000	1452291343	2016-01-08 23:15:43	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Feeling very disappointed as manners cost nothing but mean such a lot. I have never experienced anything like this before.					2016-01-08T21:59:22+0000	1452290362	2016-01-08 22:59:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I dropped my purse somewhere between the store and the parking bays. Another customer had found it and handed it into a member of staff in your store.  I was contacted by the team leader there (Gary Noble) who managed to find me and contact me on Facebook. I wasn t even aware that I d lost anything  but within 30 minutes of losing it I was reunited with my purse containing all my personal belongings  cash and cards. Massive thanks to Gary and your staff there  they went the extra mile for me today! üòä					2016-01-08T21:59:10+0000	1452290350	2016-01-08 22:59:10	8	2	8	0	10	2	2	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s hammering down with rain and I live on a narrow road which meant he had to move the van twice. He was polite  and moved it without delay.. All the time he was getting soaked.   He did have his name badge on but I didn t catch his name.   A credit to Tesco.   Thank you.					2016-01-08T21:50:25+0000	1452289825	2016-01-08 22:50:25	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can understand a mistake had been made somewhere somehow. I rang to state that I had received a totally wrong order & I was notified that a replacement would be made & arrive on Friday & someone would come pick up the Hoover. Not only did I stay in all day the next day for someone to collect this  no one turned up. I then rang back & queried as to why no one turned up & when will my order arrive. I was notified that no replacement had been made & the lady had to do it all again & this was after I d been told it was done  so I would have been waiting for nothing. Did it all again & someone did come to pick up the Hoover today & I was notified when I had to do this process again that my TV would definitely be arriving today  yet it still hasn t arrived. I m really disappointed and not happy with the confusion and messing around that s went on.					2016-01-08T21:40:01+0000	1452289201	2016-01-08 22:40:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My cousin took him to the toilet and on the way out he was hit very hard and knocked to the floor by a staff member opening the door quite fast. My son Joel obviously started crying straight away in pain. A bruise appeared on his cheek right away and his cheek swelled. I heard his screams from the other side of the store. I took him to the security guard at customer services where we were treated in a lovely way.   He summoned the manager/first aider straight away who was obviously mortified that my son was hurt. The duty managers name was Christina. She couldn t have been more apologetic and came armed with everything Minion to soothe him which he loved.   I d just like to say again  thank you for treating us so well and also no hard feelings towards the staff member who hurt him as it was an accident waiting to happen and he seems back to his old self now.					2016-01-08T18:58:28+0000	1452279508	2016-01-08 19:58:28	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Cut into it and it was hollow.  Took it back and had it replaced.  Opened the second one and exactly the same.  Hollow!  Been into Tesco and saw the Hot cross bun loaves so bought one and guess what yes hollow! !!!!! Don t you think you should teach your bakers how to bake?					2016-01-08T17:08:51+0000	1452272931	2016-01-08 18:08:51	0	8	0	0	8	8	1	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Im still waiting for a response to my complaint to a faulty electrical item. I just keep getting passed back and forth from the main customer service and electrical helpline and no one is taking any responsibility and keep saying speak to the other team. Please can someone respond to me as I am far from happy about the customer service I have received so far about returning a faulty item.

I seriously cannot thank him enough  he was so kind  caring and understanding! One of the most professional staff members I ve met who works at Tesco. His name is Niel and he s a first aider at the St. Stephens mall in Hull. I m pregnant and I collapsed in the store from abdominal pain. I was rushed to hospital from the store  he was brilliant! My partner and I really cannot thank him enough!! I went to the store when I was discharged from hospital to say a huge thank you but he d just gone home. Thank you for having such wonderful staff! Unfortunately when I had collapsed there were three members of staff that didn t even come over to see if I was okay!! Luckily my partner was with me!					2016-01-08T16:46:24+0000	1452271584	2016-01-08 17:46:24	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It wasn t a huge deal but she got very upset and tearful and wouldn t speak to any of us  especially me! We were served by  Wayne  (no idea of surname I m afraid) and he noticed she was upset and asked her if she d like to help scan the shopping. This small act of kindness not only cheered her right up  as soon as we walked away she apologised to me AND her brother...almost unheard of without a little persuasion! So I d like to pass on my thanks to a great staff member and also a positive post amongst (I m sure) a few negative ones. Happy new year :)					2016-01-08T16:33:39+0000	1452270819	2016-01-08 17:33:39	212	20	212	5	237	20	14	6	30	0	207	0	0	0	0	0	0

I stopped my grocery shopping with you over a year ago due to your prices  I shall now no longer use Tesco Direct for any shopping. You have no respect for your customers  every little helps (Tesco)!!!!   From early FÔªøebruary 2Ôªø016  we will be introducing a ¬£2 delivery charge for Click+Collect orders under ¬£30 at Tesco direct. This will help ensure we can continue to offer you the convenience of picking up your order from your chosen store at a time that suits you.  A free Click+Collect option will still be available for orders over ¬£30 on Tesco direct  and there s no change to our home delivery options. Our Delivery Saver customers will benefit from a minimum spend of just ¬£10 for free Click+Collect on Tesco direct.  We will be in touch again with more information before these changes come into effect.  Find out more about Delivery Saver here.

The majority of products would have been under ¬£30.00-but over the years  would have added up to a few hundred pounds I would guess. Had a ¬£2.00 charge already been in place  most of these items (mainly household) would have come from Argos. I live in fairly Central London where we don t have any  big  Tescos. The ONLY way access to all this stock is through Click and Collect if Tesco want me to buy it from them.  I ve been looking at your replies to previous posts stating how Tesco is really listening to feedback on this. What about an option to Click and Collect that s still free for orders under ¬£30.00 but without the Next Day delivery to store aspect? Most items I buy aren t urgently needed and it d be no problem to wait  say a week for them. A bit like the difference between  next day  and free  super saver  (slower) delivery options on ebay. Choice is always good. If  free  orders were sent in bigger groups  less often  I d presume the cost would have to be less. Is it worth looking into?

I won t be paying a delivery charge when you are able to deliver sooooo many orders to a store in one go and save a lot of money!  In future I ll buy online elsewhere and shop at morrisons  it s closer.  I chose tesco to do my shopping because I could  kill 2 birds with one stone  and collect my direct orders at the same time!

Including my daughters bike which came with completely the wrong seat that you were far from helpful with and we had to go on a 90+ mile round trip to the factory that made it to get it replaced for the correct seat (they don t even make the seat in the box so it s entirely YOUR fault) and now I get an email telling me you re charging ¬£2 for this already shocking service  for me to make the 12 mile round trip to your store to collect anything I order on click and collect under ¬£30. Sorry but you ve now lost my custom and that s worth over ¬£200 a week to you with food  petrol & mobile phones.

However  I have a coop that is only 2 minutes away and Amazon (and various other retailers) on my phone that offer free click and collect so I will be using those options in future. You ve not just lost the Tesco direct orders off me but also a regular top up grocery shop.					2016-01-08T13:27:55+0000	1452259675	2016-01-08 14:27:55	3	7	3	0	10	7	6	1	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I use the service a lot  and have answered every survey that follows a click and collect sale to say my main reason for using it is the free delivery.  I bought ink cartridges and DVDs from you this way recently  instead of using Amazon as I always have done before because of their free delivery charge minimum being increased to ¬£20. There is absolutely no incentive to using Tesco now.  Back to Amazon for me.  What a shame that something great that Tesco does is being stopped.					2016-01-08T12:57:04+0000	1452257824	2016-01-08 13:57:04	6	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I tend to use Click & Collect because I live on my own and can t get time off work for postal deliveries but Amazon drops off at places nearby me so I can pick up without a charge. A shame for people who don t have that option though.					2016-01-08T12:48:06+0000	1452257286	2016-01-08 13:48:06	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son is nearly 4 and is disabled. He currently wears your 6+ nappies  which are great  but they are getting too small.   When you ve got a child with additional support needs they  at some stage  get referred to a continence service and receive nappies; however  there is often a huge wait to receive this service and once you do  you receive a limited amount of nappies.  Nappies that you can buy online  and largely not in supermarkets  aimed at children with continence issues are hugely overpriced  much like many products in ASN market.   There are a lot of us out there with this problem and a huge gap in the market. Every little helps...pleaseeeeeee please help us out.  Thanks for listening.

Last item: Finish Quantum Dishwasher Tablets (60s at ¬£10)...what a surprise  another empty shelf. Ridiculous!

Humax HDR1800T 320GB Freeview+ HD Recorder with Twin Tuners Item never arrived!!! DON T BOTHER... I ordered this item (TV Recorder) for Grandma s birthday as a gift from all the family  she wanted this so she wouldn t miss all her favourite Christmas telly so it would be an ideal gift  I ordered on the 7th of December for guaranteed delivery in 2 to 4 days in time for her birthday on the 15th  got the email straight away to confirm all this  however it never arrived at my chosen store. her birthday came and went but still no item  after many calls and many promises Tesco advised me to either cancel the order or wait  by now it was too close to Christmas to be guaranteed delivery by the end of the year!!!

It says 1-2 people put I put it up by myself.The tree was delivered on time.The only negative comment is  I had left instructions at the front of the house as to where the tree should be left. it was left in area where the public could get access  so may not have been there when I got home from work. hence a 4* rating rather than a 5* which I would of given.lovely good value tree though.

We always buy chicken on our weekly shop  freeze it and use it as and when  but we have noticed it gradually getting worse and worse quality. I ve just had to cut of so much of the veiny bloody bits  ive lost over half of what ive bought  We always find this and like i say the quality is going down  we didnt have this when we shopped at different supermarkets I have to admit i am slightly fussy about eating lean and clean bits of chicken  but it is becoming beyond a joke  we get multiple skinless chicken breast on one of your deals  but really it isnt a great deal because of all the waste. We would be so much better off going on a seperate shop to a butchers as you know your getting the quality with your purchase  which would still be a lot cheaper after you take away all the waste. I do hope your quality checks can be improved because with our busy lifes we dont have enough spare time to do seperate shops all the time.					2016-01-07T18:13:34+0000	1452190414	2016-01-07 19:13:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would preferably like to purchase them in store.  Could you possibly tell me when you are due to expect these in your Loughborough Rushes branch?

You take my money straight away  i wait all day for the email to say my order can be collected.  It didn t arrive  So i called you on the 6th and you say the parcel was  lost in transit   ok fair enough  things happen. You say you will re order it for me and i can collect Today. Again no email from you.   I call up and you now say the item is out of stock. And all you can do is refund me.   Which takes 5 working days.   So essentially i have just given you a pay day loan  so to speak. I pay for something you don t send out the goods and I m out of pocket for 14 days while its sorted.   Once again Tesco I applaud your excellent customer service					2016-01-07T16:43:53+0000	1452185033	2016-01-07 17:43:53	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This would be okay with me if it was a case of me being too lazy to go to the shop but it is not  it is because you do not always stock the items in your shops  they are only available online  so i have no alternative but to order it  if i want to shop with Tesco s.  All those small gifts like a doll  video  dress or a certain book for some childs birthday will have to be bought elsewhere  like shopping at Amazon who still do FREE delivery for most purchases however minor the item.  I have to say i am very disappointed by this change  especially since fuel prices have dropped so dramatically lately  so it i not as if you are doing it to offset and extra charges.					2016-01-07T16:29:10+0000	1452184150	2016-01-07 17:29:10	0	11	0	0	11	11	5	6	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called into our local Tesco as if been given ¬£100 in vouchers.With it being just after Christmas I thought I d spend them on groceries as a family of 8 you can appreciate how much that costs! I had three of my children with me today -the older two helping to load the belt while the baby was in a sling nursing.  Yes we had a fair amount of shopping which you d think would be a good thing for Tesco but the attitude of the cashier was awful! Huffing and puffing with the occasional tut!  Then I noticed that is picked up smoked bacon instead of unsmoked in my 3 for ¬£10. I apologised and asked to swap it.  One member of staff went away (there were 3 just stood around) came back and announced they had none -the area was over filled with smoked which is why I d obviously mistakenly picked it up. They suggested 2 single packs. All fine aside when I pointed out that wouldn t work with the 3 for 10 offer I was actually met with  no it won t...  I asked what they d like me to do and the cashier along with 2 other members of staff all looked at me ..bags of shopping around my feet and three small children and said I d  have to search through and get the other items back out   No one was helpful or proactive.  Would it have been sensible (having worked in retail for years myself) to have apologised for the over fill of the incorrect product given me the two packs of unsmoked and scanned the pack of smoked to ensure the offer worked?  The staffs attitude was appalling and clearly my large shopping bill was too much trouble.  I think I ll stick to Aldi in future.					2016-01-07T13:15:31+0000	1452172531	2016-01-07 14:15:31	8	3	8	0	11	3	3	0	0	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have an idea  it may have been mentioned before but I ve neither seen nor heard anything so here goes...    There should be a way of uploading a shopping list  with a limited number of items  onto the tesco site - then when you scan your clubcard on to the zapper thingy in the store your list pops up and when you scan that item that s on your list it starts totting up the total as normal.....   Maybe...!?					2016-01-07T11:29:49+0000	1452166189	2016-01-07 12:29:49	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The last thing I ordered from tesco was not there to collect when I was informed it would be available and I was told by staff that  you didn t know where it was . I was offered a refund as the easy solvable solution which did not help the matter. The store manager also told me that yodel aren t very reliable and have been known to forge signatures when signing for deliveries. If this is the case  then why are you using them? When I later spoke to a person at tesco direct  they were told by the store that they had no recollection of speaking to me.  I would suggest only applying this new charge to customers if you can offer the highest standard of service  which I did not receive recently at your Tiverton store in Devon.  I d like to add this was the second time that I ordered something and it wasn t there because you didn t know where it as or it was at an entirely different store.   Appalling service and needless to say I won t be using tesco direct again.					2016-01-07T10:52:18+0000	1452163938	2016-01-07 11:52:18	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

You will find your coupons from the last 6 months listed below and you can print the active ones you want to use  - quote from Tesco clubcard coupon section.  Tesco obviously don t appreciate the ¬£5k+ pa I spend as I haven t had any  thank-yous  for the past 12-18mths - I have spoken to customer services who say they are randomly allocated.  If that s the case  please don t put a quote that says they re to say thank you!  I can handle not having money off coupons  but the lack of a thank-you is incredible.

I am not a moaner and have very little time to write these posts but I can t help myself today because I find this disgraceful.   I must have spent around ¬£7K with the Tesco brand in the last five years and a minimum of ¬£1000 with Tesco Direct. I use Tesco direct because Tesco force me to  because they don t have what I want in the local stores (there are five in a one mile radius from my house) and because I am forced to use their online channel  they now expect me to pay for delivery when it would be cheaper to walk to a shop. But I can t because they DON T STOCK what I need!!!! I called their customer service team to air my thoughts and was  talked over  by a Scottish customer service Representative who wanted to make the point that Tesco are losing money from not charging delivery to their stores. He says it was like having it delivered to my home for free. What nonsense!  I argued with this and said that Tesco deliver to their own stores (one destination)with a truck full of items (and if they don t have this strategy then there is no hope for them coming out of the financial hole they are in) and therefore there is just one delivery cost! Why should customers be involved in their lack of process? The customer representative didn t listen  argued with me and talked over me when I spoke. I ended up putting the phone down after such disrespect.  To this end   I would like to say that Tesco  unfortunately  is a necessity to many people. It is convenient. But that is it. Other major stores are far customer centric and have ways of engaging returning customers so they remain loyal. I m changing my shopping methods and going to keep these organisations afloat  not Tesco. Not anymore.   Over and Out.					2016-01-07T10:15:14+0000	1452161714	2016-01-07 11:15:14	0	7	0	1	8	7	4	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The cleaner was cleaning the floor  made me move out of his way so he continue to clean the floor. I did so but went and complained to customer services. Apparently he is the cleaning manager  but clearly he needs to be re trained. When I went back to where I was shopping he looked as if he was going to ask me to move again so I told him I wasn t going to. He then proceeded to argue with me as to how he asked me to move rather than running me over. He could easily have waited as I was in the process of trying to move my big trolley. I walked off because he should not be speaking to customers like that. Tesco should be looking at re-training some of their managers. The lady at customer service was lovely but feel I have to raise it further as he argued with me.... Not acceptable or appropriate!					2016-01-07T08:55:58+0000	1452156958	2016-01-07 09:55:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For my Christmas present my mum and sister bought me two pairs of maternity pyjamas  two night dresses and a dressing gown through the online service as NO store stocks any maternity wear. Unfortunately the pyjamas and night dresses are too big and I need a size smaller. We have been told that we can not do an exchange through the online service as part of the payment was using the  boost vouchers  and that we can only exchange in store. This would prove to be difficult as I have previously stated NO store stocks maternity wear  meaning that I would have to exchange for pyjamas and night dresses designed for someone who is NOT pregnant - but I am pregnant and need maternity clothing. Now your policy is fine for the every day woman but appalling for those who are pregnant. I am now stuck with either maternity clothing that is too big or exchanging for clothing that is not suitable for my condition. This needs to be sorted and addressed ASAP.					2016-01-07T08:51:26+0000	1452156686	2016-01-07 09:51:26	1	12	1	1	14	12	7	5	12	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your loampit vale  tesco express store has gone from a decent store to an absolutely awful store that actually needs a deep clean and refurbish. No wonder the new sainsburys local has taken off.  I used to be on first name basis with many of the staff but in the past year it seems there has been an almost whole store staff change.   I walked in today to buy something for dinner and i couldn t concentrate  the stench was awful. It smelt like rotten milk and old  food  the store was empty and barely anyone was working.   I think this is something that seriously needs to be looked into as to be honest environmental health would probably have a field day with this store.  I used to come to the store daily now its only in pure desperation and the odd hopes that it has improved. Still waiting for the change. It was a great local store. I hope it can be rescued before it s closed down.					2016-01-06T21:53:37+0000	1452117217	2016-01-06 22:53:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was speaking to his cleaner in a very debasing  patronising and demoralising way and the poor chap was just standing there taking it while he was being told how bad he is at his job  while his manager openly and quite loudly ridiculed his work and basically spoke to him like he was an imbecile.  I could not stand by and let this happen as  being a compassionate human being  I know that this is not an acceptable way to treat or speak to any other human being in the 21st century.  I approached the pair while he was in mid rant (I had watched him criticize the man s work at 3 petrol pumps before stepping in) and asked for the manager s name.  He told me his name was Roger and that he was the cleaning manager.  I then asked him to apologise to his stall member as that is the least he should do and he sniggered at me.  I explained my upset at his manner  words and attitude to his staff member and he told me he was  sorry I felt like that but he has an audit tomorrow and he needs to make sure everything is done properly .  I explained that I didn t care about his audit and that it was nothing to do with how I feel  it is all to do with his attitude towards his staff  that if he treats them with respect and encouragement they will be more responsive and more likely to give him the results he is after than they will if he speaks to them like that.  I then told the staff member that he should never allow this man - or anyone else for that matter - to treat him in that way again.  I again asked  Roger  to apologise and  give him his due  he did but it was obvious he was just paying me lip service.  Come on Tesco  this is truly unacceptable in this modern day and age   Nobody is on this earth to be another s  whipping boy  but this manager seems to think otherwise.  Nobody should gain pleasure from debasing and humiliating another (Unless of course it is part of a consensual act) but again   Roger  appeared to lose sight of this today.  I left the petrol station incredibly upset at the way this man had been treated and will make a point of saying hello to him if I see him again - if he has not been sacked today to give  Roger  an extra power boost.  I sincerely hope not.  What I would have liked to have seen is Roger rolling up his sleeves and showing the poor man exactly what a good job looks like  if he was not getting the results that were expected of him and  Leading by example and  if the audit is that important to him  mucking in as part of his team but instead I saw an example of complete and utterly unacceptable behaviour which MUST NOT be condoned by any company - be it my own small inependent business or a multi national like Tesco. We are all working to provide for our families just as  I am sure  this man is.  I don t know his background but I am sure he hasn t taken on a cleaning job as the job of his dreams but as a way to support himself and maybe his family.  Maybe Roger needs to be reminded of this human angle as well?  Please look into this as if all the cleaning team are being treated like this then this tyrant needs to be stopped - immediately.  Thank you.					2016-01-06T19:49:35+0000	1452109775	2016-01-06 20:49:35	10	4	10	0	14	4	3	1	2	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went today to the Hartlepool Extra store and saw at least 4 people without children get into their cars which were parked the closest to the store...I had to park further away and run across the car park  in the rain with my 13 month old. Just after Christmas I went on 2 separate occasions to find no spaces...probably because they were full of people with no children who a) couldn t be bothered to walk a bit further or b) didn t want to get their car doors dented.  And I won t even mention the people that park on the double yellow lines outside the front entrance...there s going to be a serious accident one of these days. The whole car park needs redesigning with someone who actually patrols it and tells people they shouldn t be parking in places that weren t designed for them					2016-01-06T18:12:24+0000	1452103944	2016-01-06 19:12:24	4	13	4	0	17	12	1	11	8	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

You had my favourite De Cecco spaghetti on offer. I selected no substitutes and guess whatdelivery turns up no De Cecco but has Napolina substituted (inferior). It was for tonights dinner so had no choice......very poor Tesco....gave you a chance and you failed.					2016-01-06T16:48:16+0000	1452098896	2016-01-06 17:48:16	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in to buy a Shaver. The one I wanted was ¬£90 but it s being advertised online for ¬£45. Why are you advertising the same things for two different prices? I asked one of the members of staff why they are different and he said online is always different  so I asked if I could take it for 45 as advertised online as I need it for tonight. He said that unfortuantly he can t but I can order it from Click and Collect for tomorrow (Not helpful as I need it ASAP)  It makes no sense to me why things are priced different online and in store					2016-01-06T16:01:34+0000	1452096094	2016-01-06 17:01:34	1	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After receiving an email telling me my money was ready to be collected  I went to your Blackpool store and was initially asked to come back in 15 minutes because they were changing shifts and had to wait for the computers to update.   When I said I would wait (as I d made a special journey to the store)  I was then told the computer system was now down so would have to come back at another time.  When I mentioned to the assistant that your service was never straightforward  her exact reply was  it never is  you should try working here    Not a particularly helpful remark and it did nothing to improve my already dim view of your service!  She offered to call me when the computers were working again but never called - no surprise there!   Maybe I have just been unlucky on each occasion I ve tried your service  but surely you can train your staff better than to just use flippant remarks when things aren t working properly and the customer is not happy.  I used Tesco s because  according to Moneysavingexpert.com  they were offering the best exchange rate. However  the extra time and costs involved in making a second journey have probably wiped out any savings I might have made.  Every little helps I guess  or not in this case....					2016-01-06T15:14:15+0000	1452093255	2016-01-06 16:14:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They charged but only if the lead was held at a specific angle. You kindly offered to repair this. My children were delighted they got their tablets back.  Remember how I said they charged but only if the lead was held at a specific angle? Well what your repair team did was put in a part that disintegrated after just over 90 days. Yes disintegrated. No longer even able to charge if held at a specific angle.  You ask why I mention the 90 days? Well your technical support team called me today to tell me that since it is over the 90 days warranty Tesco will do nothing to repair it.  So Tesco have taken a barely working Hudl and turned it into a not-working Hudl.  Your ever so polite technical team rep who phoned me and was polite enough to only cut me off when speaking a handful of times told me that Tesco rather than repair the Hudl would give me ¬£30.  When I asked how I was supposed to tell a 6 year old that Tesco put a poor standard part into his Hudl which at least worked but no longer does  here is ¬£30 but no tablet. His response was  Not my problem this is what Tesco are doing and that s the final say. I speak on behalf of Tesco   So Tesco how coincidental that you replace a part with one that has a 90 day warranty and just over the 90 days it falls apart.  I m sure that my 6 year old will be delighted to know that he can have ¬£30 and will have to save a lot more than that to get his tablet back as the repair cost to repair Tesco s shoddy work is ¬£59.  When I asked for this to be escalated and for a manager to call me back his response was  you ll get the same answer from him as i speak on behalf of Tesco .   Well Tesco I speak on behalf of your customers. I speak as someone who has regularly bought goods from Tesco. Even after an ipod was stolen in delivery for my eldest son s birthday leaving him without on his birthday.  You may think that fobbing a customer off with ¬£30 when they will have to spend more to replace what you should have done when it was within warranty is acceptable but I do not. I will make it my life s goal to spread the word round as far as possible that Tesco s products are not to be trusted. their warranty is ficticious as they will damage your goods further.  i will tell my 6 year old that Tesco make millions of pounds in profit but he has not to get his tablet back as they messed up and refuse to pay for it to be replaced back to a working state.  I don t care how many times I have to post and share this message I will do so until my dying day.  Kindest warm regards and a Happy New Year to you all.

I hold you completely responsible for my lapse in New Years resolutions!!! Everything was planned  healthy breakfasts of kale and spinach smoothies  high protein packed lunches  lean meat and veg for dinner. All due to start on Monday 4th when we returned home after our Christmas break! All organised  planned and ordered before Christmas!!! The online order was delivered  over 25 hours late  leaving me at unable to feed and increasingly  HANGRY  boy to deal with!!! We were told no information leaving us to wait until 11pm on Monday  hoping our order may turn up. AGAIN on Tuesday after waiting ALL day for you to confirm OUR order  we were told it would be delivered at 8pm. No one was able to give us an update  other than the driver was on his way  and would hopefully make it to us  but only AFTER all other deliveries were made. So we spent over two ours patiently watching numerous Tesco s vans drive right on by!  EVENTUALLY the delivery turned up  after 10pm last night  but alas the order was not complete! Over half of our fresh veg and ALL of the meat was not delivered  NO cereal (which at 10.30pm after a froglets dinner would have gone a long way to solve the HANGRY boy)  and ALL of the frozen items were ALL partially defrosted! Had our order been on the delivery van for the full 24hours it had taken to get to us?! The customer care team on the phone were good at reading out their cue cards  empathy and sincerity in the apologist lines read verbatim were greatly appreciated. *said with much sarcasm*  And despite promises of refunds  discounts and gestures of good will  nothing has been sent..... Perhaps that will take over 24hours too?					2016-01-06T10:26:40+0000	1452076000	2016-01-06 11:26:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I done my online grocery shop on the Monday wanting it for the Tuesday between 9pm-10pm. I then received a text message saying it will be delayed until 10.15pm-10.45pm which was slightly enjoying as it was late anyway but I understand some delays can t be helped.  So it got to  10.30pm... 11.00pm... 11.30pm... MIDNIGHT.. My delivery still hadn t turned up and I had no phone call to say it wasn t coming either.  I then had a phone call in the morning saying it will come in the morning but they can t give me a time.  No apologies and no mention of any discount for the inconvenience this has caused me and my family.  It is now 9.43am on Wednesday and STILL no delivery. Me my partner and my son are not impressed to say the least.  This is the first time this has happened how ever it s the way these problems get dealt with that cause the issues and in this case the the problem was not handles in the correct way whatsoever ever.  WARNING to people who are thinking of online shopping with Tescos you may get it 2 days later than you wanted and you will probably have about 10 replacement items.					2016-01-06T09:43:11+0000	1452073391	2016-01-06 10:43:11	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

What on earth is this stupid Nickname for a recipient‚Äôs address? On my first attempt  I think I was timed out during payment authorisation because after waiting for 5 minutes I got a message saying my card was rejected. So I started again  but could not use the same Nickname (told I was already using it! for the same address??!) So I just typed some random rubbish letters. When my payment was eventually accepted  I could see no trace of this Nickname anywhere in my order details. So what is the use of it?					2016-01-05T22:39:26+0000	1452033566	2016-01-05 23:39:26	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After defrosting the turkey I prepared it in the usual manner i.e. Removing giblets from body and the plastic from neck and cooking the turkey for the correct time. Upon carving the turkey I found that there were two green bits equal distance in the top of the breast which looked like some kind of stuffing but as I carved I could clearly see that it was the flesh of the turkey itself. Not wanting to risk eating the turkey (especially with my six year old son ) we had to sadly throw it all away leaving me and my wife very upset and my guests very disappointed with no turkey for Christmas Day or leftover turkey to last into the remainder of the festive holiday. I have always bought Tesco s turkey s before and always been pleased with the results but sadly I feel this year Christmas dinner was ruined for us and all our guests. I bring this to your attention in the hope you do something to rectify this issue. Look forward to hearing from you.    Yours regretfully   John Seaton Robinson					2016-01-05T21:27:57+0000	1452029277	2016-01-05 22:27:57	0	16	0	0	16	16	3	13	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The lady at the cafe even responded  well it wasn t on the plate when I gave it you you and this has never happened before     I m utterly shocked the duty manager didn t even say two words to me #tescos shocking   Waiting for a call from the manager if the staff had dealt with it with a simple level of customer service as you would expect then I wouldn t of had to complain .    Just glad my 15 month old didn t have that piece of toast.					2016-01-05T21:14:11+0000	1452028451	2016-01-05 22:14:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Children with additional needs seem to be let down and I wondered if some of you could take just a fee moments to like or share this post. Thank You .    Hello Tesco .... I believe that the only way to get your attention to certain matters ... is to attempt to do something like this ..... so I will commence  .... as a mother to special needs children and a friend to other parents of special needs children ... can I ask please if or when you plan to introduce nappies larger than a 6 +. Children with additional needs often take longer to toilet train or may be unable to toilet train and many areas don t help families anymore with provision for nappies for our children. It appears  my dear friends  that you are missing a good opportunity to increase your profits. Please spare a thought for families who need your help. Many thanks for taking the time to read this.					2016-01-05T20:59:00+0000	1452027540	2016-01-05 21:59:00	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had arranged for a home delivery on saturday for food for my daughters birthday party being held at lunchtime on Sunday.  Being 7 months pregnant the main reason for this was the easy entertain sandwich platters  of which I ordered four (80 sandwiches) thus majorly cutting down on effort required on sunday. I dutifully gave more than the required 3 days notice and received no error message that I had done anything wrong. When the delivery came on saturday night at 9.30pm....the printed reciept simply said easy entertain products unavailable! No alternative  no phone call to warn me of this  thus leaving me the night before the party with no sandwiches or items to make any with!!! A huge  huge inconvenience!!! I have been trying to phone tesco ever since to express my disappointment and to find out exactly what went wrong but I keep getting stuck in a phone queue at their  busy time  (this seems to be all the time). I eventually did get through last night to be told it would be investigated in store and they would call back within 30 mins. It s now been 25 hours and no reply  I expected better tesco!!!!!					2016-01-05T20:20:03+0000	1452025203	2016-01-05 21:20:03	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I was packing away my delivery there was a tray of chilled items missing from off the van . The driver was really apologetic and tried to contact the store but couldn t get through. He then went above and beyond by taking my address and contacting me when he returned to the store and then came out of his way to deliver my shopping to me on his late run . I had contacted customer services spoke to a lovely lady called Christina land who contacted the store for me but they said my shopping wasn t there which is very strange that the driver found it as soon as he returned. The driver I unfortunately didn t get his name but just wanted to say a big thank you for all he did .					2016-01-05T19:37:08+0000	1452022628	2016-01-05 20:37:08	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They were due to be delivered between the 15th-18th Dec  on the 22nd they still haven t arrived so after checking the online tracker  they had been dispatched on the 10th and the courier had collected the item and they were out to delivery. I called tesco to ask where my delivery was  and they said they should have been delivered by now the courier was  hermes  I spoke to a very friendly and helpful advisor called Georgia and she said she would contact Hermes and get back to me within the hour. To which she did and said unfortunately Hermes had  lost  the item but she had called my local tesco extra store and fortunately they had the item and would I mind travelling to get it  as if she sent one out to me that day  it would never arrive before Christmas as she assumed it was a present. It was  and I told her I was most grateful. The item was put back as promised. I would like tesco to say thank you to Georgia  as she was very friendly and extremely helpful to find a replacement and in a short space of time!					2016-01-05T15:54:25+0000	1452009265	2016-01-05 16:54:25	3	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday the 4th Jan I bought two finest chilled soups and ate one for lunch without a second thought. Later that day I noticed the other (Morrocan Spiced Chicken) soup had a sell by date of 31 Dec. Please note one of my work colleagues also had an issue of having bought an out of date item on the same day that was from 28 Dec and has already gone to Twitter with their complaint. I didn t want to make a fuss so I went in today to make them aware of issue and just accepted a refund. However low and behold when I went in a few hours later to buy my lunch I find the exact same soup back in the fridge. I demanded to speak with the manager who didn t seem very apologetic or empathetic to the magnitude of the problem. He seemed more interested in providing excuses and furthering the argument. He even said that every store in the UK has out of date food on their shelves. So I m being forced to take this issue further as I find his attitude and response utterly unacceptable!					2016-01-05T15:44:20+0000	1452008660	2016-01-05 16:44:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought some bathroom scales from Tesco click and collect just before Christmas. They are faulty so I rang the helpline to request a replacement. I was told I would have to drive to Maldon or Basildon to collect said replacement. There are 3 Tesco stores in Chelmsford but a replacement can t be sent to any of them apparently. Instead I either have to go for a 20 - 30 minute drive or to take the faulty scales back to one of our stores for a refund and reorder a new set. Well I m not wasting more money on petrol after already having had to shell out for new batteries for scales that don t work. They ll be going back and needless to say I won t be ordering them from Tesco.					2016-01-05T15:09:58+0000	1452006598	2016-01-05 16:09:58	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But imagine my shock this morning when making breakfast for my son to notice that my lurpak spreadable which was delivered (21/12/15) went out of date on the (25/11/15) so was already nearly 4 weeks past its use by date and subsequently I have been using for another 2 weeks!

Ordered a home delivery for between 8-9pm  it came 11pm! I had called customer services at 9:45 and was told should be another 15 min as driver was an hour behind due to traffic. Another hour later he turned up. Found out 5 vans had broken down! I certainly dont blame this driver at all  he was lovely and polite. They did refund me my 2 pounds delivery charge  but I had to be up at 5am  for work today and I m knackered!! I do want to say though that the food delivery drivers have always been so polite and helpful and their customer service is brilliant and it has never been late before. I will be using his tesco again  but only one more chance then I m swapping to sainsbury if it s late again. Vouchers would be nice also as I m a kranky dragon this morning I m so tired! Thanks!					2016-01-05T08:06:02+0000	1451981162	2016-01-05 09:06:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But today they have redone the shelves and the icing sugar has been taken off. Please reconsider this. It s nice to have a choice of 6 sugars but only the one missing makes smooth icing for cakes.  I did ask the staff at Kingsley park terrace.

I think we should now make a stand  by business  boycotting Tesco for any item that has VAT on it until they can produce a VAT receipt at the point of sale.

So  very badly. For something that claims to be  ultra dry  and provide  day and night protection confidence  or some nonsense  they fail spectacularly. I should have known better than to buy a packet of these glorified handkerchiefs  but I did and now I pay the price.   All three of my son s sleeping bags were in the wash today  having each been soaked through over the last three nights. I had to dry one with a hairdryer after washing it to make sure he had something to wear tonight but lo and behold  he has woken up for his first feed of the night soaked through only a couple of hours after going to bed. Not cool  Tesco. Not cool. I can t afford more spare sleeping bags  nor the running costs of extra washing cycles purely for pee soaked bed things.    I use Tesco for all my household and food shopping but I have to go to Asda to get nappies I can rely on. Without a car this isn t easy to lug grocery shopping or bulky packets of nappies between supermarkets whilst carrying a 19lb 5 month old hulk-child.   You guys need to seriously revisit the product design of your nappies (which are notorious amongst the parenting community for being unreliable) as they are failing on their main purpose. This isn t something I should have go deal with at 4am on a couple hours sleep  especially when said nappy wasn t even full!  Please kindly sort it out.   Yours   An irritated new mother and her 5 month old  son who both smell vaguely of baby pee.					2016-01-05T04:09:58+0000	1451966998	2016-01-05 05:09:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called customer services today after being unsuccessful in changing my address online. My postcode was bringing up a different address to mine  and there was no other option in the drop down.  After a drawn-out conversation with the member of staff  I was told that the option isn t there for my address to be changed so my option was to order it to the address that comes up and It should turn up at mine! Appalling! I advised her that I will not being doing that  I just want my address changed so I can order my groceries with Tesco. (I m trying to spend my hard earned money with your company) I was then shockingly told that she can not do it as this  option  isn t available so I best just go and order with someone else!  My word! Shocked is an understatement. Is this correct? I m confused? Is there something I am missing.   It goes without saying that I went on to order with Sainsbury s.  I would be very grateful for an explanation to this situation please. I look forward to hearing from you					2016-01-04T23:29:44+0000	1451950184	2016-01-05 00:29:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was shopping with my 9 year old son when he started coughing and it turned into an asthma attack. I started to panic when I realised we had left his inhaler at home! A member of staff (I didn t get her name) quickly found another member of staff  Caroline H who came to our rescue. She sat my son down in the staff room and quickly connected up her nebuliser.  After a few minutes my son was looking a much better colour  and breathing normally again. So please accept a huge thank you to these two lovely ladies  especially to Caroline H  as her swift assistance really was appreciated. My son and I are extremely grateful!

I have just been to Tesco Express and tried to buy the meal deal of stir fry veg  noodles and stir fry sauce for ¬£3. They had the noodles and the veg but there wasnt any sauce! Guess what they told me they can never get the sauce as they are a Tesco extra!!!!!!!!!! So I spoke to the manager and said surely advertising an offer which is available until 29 February must be against trading standards. I asked him to remove the signs for the offer and he said he couldn t do that either as its against the law to not show the prices of the goods!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When we asked him to move his van and showed him our private parking signs he verbally abused my husband and I  waking our two daughters up. He finally moved when I started to take down the registration but then slammed his door and reved the engine parking behind our car and blocking our car in. Rather than take the food directly to our neighbour he decided to walk across our drive in an attempt to gain a reaction. He then reversed back into our drive when pulling off. We phoned the store immediately and spoke to the duty manager who is looking into this but wanted to make head office aware In the mean time as this is disgusting behaviour and our eldest daughter witnessed the man shouting at my husband and I.					2016-01-04T20:10:56+0000	1451938256	2016-01-04 21:10:56	0	6	0	1	7	5	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I went to a tesco store in Antrim the next day  they had the television in stock. I spoke to both the store manager and a person who worked in the electrical department and they both assured me if I rang tesco direct I could cancel my order and get a refund  so I purchased a television in store  came home and rang to cancel the order. I was told I would receive an email within 24hrs to let me know that it had gone through.  The next day I rang and spoke to Ryan who told me the the girl I had been speaking to the previous day hadn t processed the cancellation properly and he would do that for me. He called me back two hours later to let me know that this had happened and the money would be back in my account within 3-5 working days. I have included a recording of this telephone conversation as an attachment.   I received an email this morning to tell me the television which was meant to have been cancelled a week ago was going to be deliveredtomorrow on the original date. When I rang this evening to query this  I was told that my order hadn t actually been cancelled and the girl would do that for me now and my money would be in my account within 3-5 working days.  This is the third time I ve had to ring and try to cancel this order to get my money back  money which I have been waiting for as I had used remaining savings to buy the television on the 27/12/15 thinking I would be receiving a refund shortly. I am extremely angry about this  and I certainly will not be using tesco direct again and will not be recommending it to anyone. Your customer service is appalling and no one seems to know what the other one is doing  even though it should be quite easy to type what is spoken down the telephone onto the computer in front of them.  If you could get back to me as soon as possible with regards to this matter as I am also going to be contacting trading standards about your inability to give me a refund.					2016-01-04T18:50:17+0000	1451933417	2016-01-04 19:50:17	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got an email from Tesco saying they had dispatched the dvd player and it would be delivered on 30th Dec. The tracking on the website wasn t working so I phoned Tesco and was told it would be delivered by 7pm that night. It didn t arrive so I called Tesco on 31st Dec. Discovered that the dvd player was coming from an external supplier called Box. I called Box - to be told they had another supplier sending the dvd player out to me. I was refunded the postage cost but have had no information sent to me from Tesco or Box. Called Tesco again today - got cut off during call and had to call back again. I was told the dvd player would be with me tomorrow  but still can t find out roughly when it will be delivered tomorrow as the tracking is still not working. So after waiting in all day on 30th Dec I will have to wait in tomorrow again in the hope that the dvd player will arrive.

Delivery slot 1pm - 2pm finally arrived at 3.15 pm (no phone call to let me know it was going to be late). I   yes I called Customer Services at 2.15 to find out where it was.  After Tesco had rung round a number of people /  stores I was told that it looks like there MAY have been a problem at the store and it MAY have gone on a different van and he MAY be running late due to problems at the store . But not to worry it would definately be delivered at some point today   they just didn t know when !!!!!! So was given delivery free (¬£2.50 refund) and a ¬£5 good will voucher to use on my next shop (as if).   And if by 3pm no-one had arrived I needed to call the  .com  manager on her mobile !!!!!!  So after it eventually turned up I noticed a number of things that I knew I hadn t ordered but was told   sorry but they are on your list !!!!!  And wasn t informed of any substitutions.   When unpacking my shopping 4 items had a best before date of 2nd January and 1 item best before tomorrow - none of which were highlighted to me.  GLUTEN FREE quorn mince was then substituted its meat free mince CONTAINING gluten .  And burgers instead of sausages - again none of which was highlighted to me.  So again it s left to me to call Customer Services to get my refund and bulk standard apology .  Sort it out Tesco - I m sorry to say I won t be shopping with you again and will not be recommending any part of your business.					2016-01-04T17:22:16+0000	1451928136	2016-01-04 18:22:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter slipped on some sort of spillage that nobody had noticed before. This understandably caused her distress and she got very upset and was rubbing the side of her leg. I told the cashier who couldn t seem less interested if she tried. Her simple reply was   ok I ll get that cleared up . There was no urgency to get anyone to clean the floor and there was zero concern shown for my daughters well being. Once getting home and looking at her hip with no leggings on she has a nice bruise from falling over! I am shocked at the lack of customer service and suggest more staff training for certain staff members!					2016-01-04T17:12:23+0000	1451927543	2016-01-04 18:12:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And refunded the delivery and went away to refund 2 meals which also was missing.    Then my order finally came  and our lass said they still had problems and in a hurry as she was 3 hours late on her run.  She is always a great deliver driver. Sorted out the 1st 2 missing item. I went on line (as their computer has broken down and they could not print anything out and I could not sign for) so after we went over it (I asked about my cigarettes she said yep) so she left saying she would refund the 2 meals which were charged (one missing  the other had a different meal in which I did not want)  I had had the delivery charge refunded and sent was a evoucher for ¬£5.00 emailed to me. I was happy with this.  So I start unpacking the shopping and lass of all I looked into the last little bag  there was 3 rothmans menthol not 6 as ordered an been charged for.  So I had to ring back about the missing cigarettes  . But when I rang again about the cigarettes being missing the man said OK after he checked if they were out of stock  which they were not. He said I will refund the cost to your bank  he said tight the bank holds the payment for 3 days and then they send it to the person bank. To which I tried to tell him this was not a thing I wanted to as I had budget my money and it takes 3 to 5 days to come back to my account. I said this as soon as he said the time it takes.   He said that its was all he could do  I asked can you not give me a voucher/ Speak to the local store and I would have them collected for me for he said no as the money that had been refunded for (I am disabled and had planned my shopping to be delivered and there is a ¬£4 charge for orders under ¬£40 and this was my fortnightly shop I will not be doing any to the next fortnight.   I once again said this would not work for me. And again I was told it was all he will do  and he had put the refund through (this had been while I was telling him I needed something else done)   I also told him I was stuck as he was making it hard for me by doing it that way to which I had no choice to take as he had put it through  You now have over ¬£20 of my money which I could have to wait 3 to 5 days to come back to my account.h.   Then I asked about a refund as this was the 2nd call  1st for late delivery (different department) and missing items (also another department I had to go to) and it was costing me money and all the messing around I had and would have to do as I needed to replace meals etc. Which means I have to try and go out in this bad weather  to go and buy more I told him I was very unhappy about this classically with the 1st delivery being sorted and me having to sort this out) but I was told I could get no other payment of  good  will)  well I said but I had 2 calls about 2 different problems with 2 different departments each which cost me to do for something was nothing to do with me. And has now caused me a problem with replacing the things and find the money to buy them as I budget to buy my shopping and have it delivered as I can t get it another way unless I go to the shop and get a taxi back!  Not happy at all. Am thinking of changing my shop which is a shame as I have been with tests for many years including insurance  but maybe time to go to another supermarket. As it is clear that I end up the worse off by using tests delivery. And the either supermarket is nearer for me to get to  it feel like being a long standing customer means nothing to Tescos.					2016-01-04T15:30:13+0000	1451921413	2016-01-04 16:30:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You ve put banners up over yr butchery counters with the word LOVE in.  what are you thinking ?  The counter below is full of the rotting corpses of young female animals who have been killed  sentient creatures who wanted to live ..and they have been killed And thus is yr idea of LOVE ?  You really do need to think again.					2016-01-04T15:14:13+0000	1451920453	2016-01-04 16:14:13	5	12	5	1	18	12	9	3	42	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Saw the offer for the Nokia Lumia 635 with free lebara ¬£10 preloaded sim and asked if the lebara deal was available in store and was told it was but on checking the sim I was given it wasn t preloaded with the credit. Went back into the store today to be told that it is an online deal and all they could do was refund me if I brought the phone and sim back; not really a good option as i have already been setting up the phone. Sorry guys  a zero for customer service on this one.					2016-01-04T13:29:44+0000	1451914184	2016-01-04 14:29:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You listened to the call  apologised and offered me a ¬£20 voucher ( despite ruining a birthday which ended up costing me a lot more to fix) and said it would be sent the 5 th Dec. When I didn t recieve it   you said it had actually not been sent until the 17th ( which in itself tell me you really couldn t have cared less about fixing the problem). I STILL have not recieved the voucher. Is this really how a company who basically claims to be family orientated says sorry? Is the voucher even Coming? Because frankly it is not about the voucher  more about validation that you have accepted your treatment of a loyal customer was disgraceful.

I visited your oaktree tesco extra store in Mansfield today with my 4 month old baby and 2 year old toddler. I obviously needed a trolley with a baby seats and a toddler seat for the children. Do they have any at that store? Apparently not! Apparently the couple they did have were stolen a while ago and tesco won t replace them. So I have woken a sleeping baby  got both children wet from the rain  stood in the supermarket for 10 minutes waiting for someone to help me find a trolley to then be told you don t have them! You should  be ashamed of yourselves tesco. I will take my custom elsewhere from now on!					2016-01-04T11:35:45+0000	1451907345	2016-01-04 12:35:45	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I could have got over the late delivery of my shopping  the fact that I m not dressed at 10.35am because I daren t go in the shower in case it arrives  that my children haven t had anything other than Christmas chocolate for breakfast because we have no food in the house.  I ordered my shopping for the first available slot today  knowing we d be landing in the UK at 22.30 yesterday and would have no essentials in the house so a later slot would be useless.  In fact I d have preferred earlier  but there was no option for that.  So I got up at 6am today  I have been working from home  in my living room  with the door open to the hall (and with the drive in plain sight).  Drinking black tea (which is disgusting  but again I ll get over it).  At 9.03 I realise my delivery is now late.  I call customer service.  Can t get hold of driver  send me ¬£5 apology.  By now  I really have had enough of black tea and children would like breakfast.  I ll cut it short  several calls and conversations later - I m told the driver tried to deliver at 08.40am.    Where did the driver try to deliver my shopping to?  Because it was not my home.  Believe me  I ve been in it all morning.  So we still aren t resolved here  I ve gone from fury to tears on the phone as I can t get a resolution or my shopping  just a ¬£5 credit off my next shop (really  you think I d risk this again?!).  What really  really  winds me up Tesco  and what I can t get over is that your driver has lied about attempting to deliver here.  Blatantly lied.  As I said to the delivery team manager - if he was genuinely outside my house  why not call my landline?  I have been offered no explanation as to why he didn t do that.  My suggestion is that he did not  because he was not here.  I don t know why he would lie  but I don t really care.  I cannot get over being made out to be wrong or a liar myself because one of your drivers  says he tried to deliver .  So your lying staff have caused you to lose a customer  I hope it s investigated but I suspect it won t be.  I am realising why the default customer service  apology gesture  is a voucher code off my next shop.  I guess you know it will never be redeemed  saves you losing any money over your incompetence though!    I am not sure my rant even foes justice to how angry and upset I am right now Tesco  because either your driver is lying or I am.  Except I am not.  So where does that leave us?  Well  it leaves me with no shopping  and you with one less future customer.  I suspect I care most.					2016-01-04T10:52:59+0000	1451904779	2016-01-04 11:52:59	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After a couple of weeks it stopped charging and was packed away in its box awaiting for me to take it back to store. Months passed and I completely forgot   Whilst tidying away gifts this year I ve found the broken Hudl. After some investigation  I understand that the charging port problems are a known fault.   Are you able to resolve this issue for me please ?					2016-01-04T02:41:19+0000	1451875279	2016-01-04 03:41:19	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The person was not only rude  but also threw out racist remarks to such an extent that my accompanying nine years old daughter was scared and cried. She doe sit want to go to TESCO as she is so scared that this guy would harm us. It is a shame to find out that although TESCO name is used for this car wash but it is not owned by TESCO and is in fact run by independent Franchise who rent space from TESCO. Would Tesco have some power to stop such people from operating from their premises and make profit from renting out space when people are clearly and openly racist? If TESCO doe sot take an action then such people would feel stronger and continue to do what they want rather than be polite and not be racist. Is TESCO strong enough to say NO TO RACISM and poor customer experience? Only TESCO can answer this question and lead the way by setting an example that such a behaviour is not accepted in western developed society.					2016-01-03T17:37:38+0000	1451842658	2016-01-03 18:37:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Monday I went to the Pool store I was interested in buying a Braun Tassimo T40 that was displayed on the shelf with NO price. I took it to a counter and asked for a price check this came up at ¬£49.50 and I was Happy to purchase at this price . I continued shopping in store and also spent time selecting T Discs for it. When I went to check out it came up at ¬£119.99. I told the checkout girl that the price check was ¬£49.50. But she said she couldn t sell it to me at that price. So I refused to buy it. I then checked the price on your Click and Collect website whilst still in store on my mobile this also stated ¬£49.50. I then went down to the back of the store to the click and collect  and asked them to again price check the inshore price  she scanned the box and the price again came up at ¬£49.50 but when she went to put the sale through it again came up at ¬£119.99. She also said she couldn t sell it at the cheaper price as her systems wouldn t allow it. I refused to buy it at the higher price obviously  and asked her to place an order for me for Click and Collect which she did and the price was ¬£49.50 which I paid there and then  and was told to come back to collect on Wednesday. I was so annoyed to have my time and fuel WASTED in this way. Your instore price check was ¬£49.50  Click and Collect was ¬£49.50 unyet if you tried to buy instore it came up at ¬£119.99  surely someone could of overridden the system with the correct price of ¬£49.50 to save me having a wasted return journey !!! I would like someone to contact me with regards to this matter as would like some kind of compensation for the in store embarrassment   and time and fuel wasted					2016-01-03T17:27:20+0000	1451842040	2016-01-03 18:27:20	3	12	3	0	15	12	8	4	5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

What planet are your click and collect pickers actually on. I ordered a three pack of Persimmon fruit which wasn t available. So why on earth would the picker think that substituting three Persimmon fruit with one single fruit was clever or acceptable. Surely logic would dictate that if the customer ordered a three pack  then three fruit was the minimum they wanted?  I suppose I should be grateful that they substituted them with the same fruit. Just means that in order to make the recipe that uses three Persimmon fruit  I now need to go to the ruddy store. Which goes against the whole point of click and collect.

Having just got back from christmas with my family  I call into my local tesco metro only to find that lying there upon the shelves already is the easter selection of chocolate. We re not even 3 days into January and I for one still have my christmas tree up! Why on Earth are we already being subjected to Easter in January  I for one would prefer it to be up around March nearer to the event...					2016-01-03T16:02:19+0000	1451836939	2016-01-03 17:02:19	4	13	4	1	18	13	7	6	27	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Placed an order for delivery this morning between 10-11am as I normally do  it was a couple of minutes late but can live with that. Driver came to the door and sadly a lot of fresh items were missing. The driver was very apologetic (we knew it was not his fault) and refunded all missing items. Phoned customer service to let them know so they can relay back to the store as they clearly have issues they need to sort.  But the reason I m writing this post  is that the driver from this morning has just visited with our tray of missing items that were found back at the store along with a few others for other customers. He is a credit to your company and we are so grateful he did this! We sadly didn t get his name  but please pass our thanks onto him. Happy new year!					2016-01-03T15:54:12+0000	1451836452	2016-01-03 16:54:12	18	3	18	2	23	3	1	2	3	0	17	0	0	0	0	0	0

On 15th December  I attended the store to order my Christmas Food from your New Christmas Range which was 2 days before the advertised deadline for this service. I ordered a ¬£29.59 Turkey Crown suitable for 17 servings. I attempted to order the Christmas Cracker dessert and the Lemon Bouche dessert  but was told these desserts were both unavailable despite still being advertised and my order being within the order period.   I collected the Turkey Crown on 22nd December 2015 and noted the Use By date was the 26th December 2015. I duly took it home and stored it  as per the storage instructions  in my refrigerator.   On Christmas morning  I took the Turkey Crown from the packaging and was distraught when I discovered that it smelt completely disgusting. It had clearly gone off and was completely inedible. In fact  the smell was so repulsive that my young children came into the kitchen to enquire what was in there.   I had a large number of people coming to my house for Christmas Lunch  and I had no other meat to cook. The Christmas meal had been planned for many months as it was the first Christmas since I had been recently married. I was extremely embarrassed to tell my guests as they arrived that the Christmas Lunch would be without Turkey. My children were so upset  the only explanation I could give them was we had given the Turkey to a family less fortunate than ourselves.   I have been a customer at Tesco for nearly 20 years. I spend at least ¬£500 a month on grocery shopping and petrol. I am normally very happy with the service you provide  but on this occasion  my expectations have not been met. I feel completely let down  and to compound my disappointment  this incident has occurred on Christmas Day when there was no way to rectify this unfortunate situation.   I returned the Turkey to the Larkfield Store on 26th December 2015. I went to the customer services desk  who refunded my Turkey Crown without question. I got the impression I was not the first person into the store to return their Turkey.   I believe I have shown great loyalty to Tesco. In times where Lidl and Aldi are constantly in the national press with advertisements stating how much money can be saved on comparative shopping  I have continued to shop at Tesco.   I look forward to hearing your comments on this matter.   Kind Regards   Stefanie Goodwin					2016-01-03T14:40:10+0000	1451832010	2016-01-03 15:40:10	2	6	2	0	8	6	4	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just seen this photo on Facebook and I am flabbergasted!! As a record collector the artwork on the sleeve is as equally important as the record and is one of the main reasons vinyl records have never gone away. Any serious record buyer would want a reduction on these due to sleeve being damaged. Treating records like knitted jumpers is appalling. If you are going to sell records you should at least train the staff to treat them correctly. There is several hundred pounds worth of stock here  which in my opinion  and I suspect trading standard s opinion  that are no longer fit for sale.

No wonder you re losing business the way your stores are run!  ******ALLOA STORE******  Started last week when advised by Tesco direct that a tablet online was the same price in store and just to nip in and pick one up......low and behold got in there and tablet still at the higher price even though everything else in the sale online had changed in store!  Manager and staff couldn t have been less helpful and not interested in the slightest.   So goes back in this morning at 7.30am for a newspaper and pain killers because you know Tesco is open 24 hours and I ll let you guess shall I............. You ll never get it! Oh yeah you will the tablet is now at the lower price less than 4 days since I was last in. So picks one up  no one at the up stairs desks  not a sole to be seen except some laxidasical cleaner half heartedly pushing a sweeping brush about  missing half the floor while she listens to music on the speaker docks at full volume. I must say it just screams professionalism. I then head down to the checkouts on the ground floor where I m greeted with a grunt from the woman? operating the self service checkouts   and when I say operating I actually mean dossing about  looking at her nails  chatting to other staff. She explains that I need to see someone up stairs about the tablet then looks at me like I m the one who s stupid! So she goes and tries to locate this tablet but you ll never guess what SOMEONE has went HOME with the keys of where these tablets are kept and they won t be back in until either 9am or 11am so can I just come back then!   Firstly what staff member is allowed to take keys home for a locked cupboard and secondly is there only one set of keys because if so that s pretty worrying!  Asked to speak to a manager and to be honest it was a bit like speaking to forest gump   the guy didn t have a clue either where or who had the keys or when whoever had them was due in but what he did suggest is that he calls when the person does arrive!   Eh no thanks. You ve had 2 chances to make a sale and you re certainly not going to get a 3rd!  Haven t shopped in tesco for years and this has just confirmed the reasons why because yous couldn t run a menage  WHAT AN ABSOLUTE SHAMBLES  #TESCO #SHAMBLES #FAILINGBUSSINESSMODEL #INCOMPETANTSTAFF #EVENWORSEMANAGERS #WONTBEBACK					2016-01-03T08:56:34+0000	1451811394	2016-01-03 09:56:34	21	6	21	2	29	5	2	3	2	0	21	0	0	0	0	0	0

So a huge thank you to the tesco delivery people :) you make our day run so much smoother and as much as us customers must annoy you sometimes  you don t snap (which is pretty amazing considering the stuff I burble about first thing in the morning)					2016-01-03T08:49:24+0000	1451810964	2016-01-03 09:49:24	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

You need to check the clocks on the tills in your Express store in Bearsted (Maidstone)  Kent.  Apparently the clock in my car  my watch (which is set by the Rugby time clock)  and BBC Radio s news programming are all running slow as the doors were locked well before 1155.  The other customer who was standing at the door looking puzzled before me must have had the same problem.  In reality  we both know your tills will have accurate time otherwise you d have great difficulty in evidencing fraudulent transactions.  I thought your member of staff was rude and unapologetic.  If she s happy to lie to a customer  it makes you wonder if she s honest when filling in her time sheet  cashing up the tills or dealing with stock discrepancies.  Regards.					2016-01-03T01:39:56+0000	1451785196	2016-01-03 02:39:56	1	5	1	0	6	5	4	1	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Re - Taplow  Buckinghamshire store  This has been flagged numerous times to store and on here. For more than 6 months  the in store price check scanners have not been working (x2).  the store has only been open a short time  and the scanners only worked for a month or two from store opening. Despite being advised that it will be reported and repaired  nothing has been done. It is a pain having to go up to a till to price check an item.  When will these be working again? If never just remove them? Thanks					2016-01-02T23:21:13+0000	1451776873	2016-01-03 00:21:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Fair play if I wanted to do a weekly shop but if I was after just 1 item that s situated next to the check outs?

The reason for my question is that I was in store purchasing a Kindle Paperwhite on 30th and wanted to boost my vouchers after having checked this was still available online and I was told that I couldn t do this.  When I enquired with customer services  I was told that the boost in store had ended on the 27th however  online this didn t finish until 31st.  Surely consistency should be carried from online to store so that confusion like this doesn t happen? I was totally disappointed that I couldn t boost my vouchers as I had been saving these to get the paperwhite and it was the only chance I had to go to store as my son has been unwell since Christmas day.					2016-01-02T20:58:21+0000	1451768301	2016-01-02 21:58:21	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You dont know the meaning of customer care and I will no longer be shopping at Tesco. We were seriously inconvienced when Tesco knew about this issue  it affected 3 family members. Why no announcement to warn customers of the issue which was casued by Tesco? Why did the duty manager not come down  why did we spend 30 mins in the store embarrassed... why did we have to spend time calling RBS to find out what was going on. Why did Tesco deny it was there issue? Whay did we have to then go back in to town to sort the vcards out  all on Jan 1st? Why do you not care that 3 people have been messed about by Tescos  what do you offer back  a sorry...  This has been very badly handled by Tesco and sorry but I will no longer be shopping at Tesco  so do the sums and work out what you have lost. You have shown you dont care or value your customers. Very poorly handled. Goodbye Tesco!					2016-01-02T20:45:57+0000	1451767557	2016-01-02 21:45:57	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

How embarrassing not just for her and the poor people who have received these gift cards who have then had to pay out of their money when their cards are turned down  but also for your staff. Not good service at all. She s very stressed out at returning yet again especially when the staff clearly don t even know what they are doing!

Very displeased. This is the fourth problem I ve had with tesco in the last two months!. I will be taking my custom else where I think. The customer service in the store I visit is horrendous  the click and collect service I attempted to use before Christmas was disgusting!  out of date food being sold at full price and sour grapes even though they are sold are sweet ones... Big warning signs to take my money and spend it else where I think.					2016-01-02T18:05:54+0000	1451757954	2016-01-02 19:05:54	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Turns out there is a security tag on rib eye steak. What the hell! To make me feel even more humiliated he then checked my receipt whilst I repacked my 198 pounds of food into the bags. Unbelievable.

As I entered the store I saw a very young staffy dog tied up outside by himself   I thought to myself perhaps the owner had popped in quickly and thought nothing of it. 40/50 minutes later I came out and saw that the same dog was still outside in the pouring rain shivering as it was so cold and wet!!! The member of staff who I believe was a trolley man was comforting the clearly distressed dog and cuddling him to keep him as warm as possible. This man was around 20 years old with dark hair and had a high vis jacket on. His act of kindness really has touched my heart. Now I understand people leave dogs outside shops for a few minutes but for that long on the rain   cold and dark in my opinion is neglectful and I hope the owners will think twice about doing this again. I heard other customers saying they were going to call the dog warden and rspca also. Well done to this young man and thank you.					2016-01-02T17:10:15+0000	1451754615	2016-01-02 18:10:15	7	2	7	0	9	2	2	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Noticing that the price reduction on them was down to just 33p  I asked them   Is Tesco really going to throw these way rather than reduce them further?  I was told that although other departments reduced down to as low as 3p  the in-store bakery refuse to as they would then  make a loss . I did ask why they would prefer to make a 100% loss rather than try to re-coop some of that  the staff said they had no idea. Do stores receive some sort of subsidy for unsold  fresh baked  goods that they do not get from other goods? Because if they do then that is despicable! Supermarkets should be FORCED to prevent this sort of waste!!! A woman who overheard this asked them why they did not donate the rolls to the homeless and they told her it was ILLEGAL to do so! That is totally untrue! Tesco  you should be ashamed of yourselves!					2016-01-02T16:26:21+0000	1451751981	2016-01-02 17:26:21	1	9	1	0	10	9	1	8	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had purchased 3 different bags of potatoes  namely Maris Pipers  Baking Potatoes and your everyday value White potatoes but the checkout operator put them all through at 3 @ ¬£2.00  when in fact one bag was only ¬£1.18. So  off I went to customer services to get a refund for being overcharged. All was going well until I mentioned the Double the Difference policy when being overcharged. I was informed that this policy was only in force if the SHELF label differed from the actual price I was charged at the checkout and NOT by a mistake made by the checkout operator. Now according to your company policy if I am overcharged I can get Double the Difference back. An overcharge is an overcharge whether it be the fault of the shelf label or checkout operator in my opinion. Please could you clarify because if your company policy has changed regarding this then you also need to change the company policy guidelines on your website.  I did get Double the Difference back in the end as a goodwill gesture and this one time only by the duty manager but I had to argue my case before this was given.   Thank you and a Happy New Year to you all					2016-01-02T16:18:52+0000	1451751532	2016-01-02 17:18:52	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just picture it  a 4 year old little girl having the last few pennies (¬£5 to be precise!) Of some money santa had given her to choose some toys  off we pop to tesco after hearing they have the all new season 4 shopkins in stock  excitedly shes ran to the toys aisle and found the box of  blind bag  shopkins  she has picked two packs to buy to start her collection off  shes been as good as gold walking round the store holding these two packs  finally get to the check out  and they wont scan.... Not bothered her mummy has explained that the man is going to find the special number so the  till lady  can put the through....stood waiting and the man comes back minus the two packs of shopkins.....his words...   There not on file  they wont scan we cant sell them  and he walks away.....  The four year old bursts into tears.....mummy has to explain to her that the shop till cant make them  beep  so we cant buy them.....little girl is heartbroken and asks if she has been naughty and is that why she cant have them.....still sobbing her mummy pays for the rest of the shopping and leaves the store....  Well that was my shopping experience today  my 4 year old named Daizee-Rai is still upset and still doesnt why she cant have her toys! Thanks tesco! Why put toys on the shelfs if you cant ACTUALLY sell them....  every little helps?..... Maybe your staff should help the little customers and not be so rude and blunt!

I had  visited  my Local Tesco Extra  store  intending to purchase  a specific TV.. it was marked at that  time  ¬£189  which I thought was a good deal.. Having  stood in a queue  at the appropriate desk  the Assistant took the  ticket  went through a set of doors for maybe 10 seconds  returned said  there were none in stock and I should order on line..  I was  slightly  confused to find when I ordered on line  the TV was in fact ¬£10.00  more expensive.  I realise  not a large amount of money however  is this a tactic used by Tesco to  artificially  offer price reductions knowing the item on line is dearer..  I was amazed  at the speed of click and collect in the same store in less than 24 hrs .. Could the  assistant  not have ordered  this in store ?					2016-01-02T13:25:03+0000	1451741103	2016-01-02 14:25:03	1	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Doing a big shop with a 2 year old is never easy  but when said 2 year old starts their tantrum 10 minutes before you hit the checkout you know you re in trouble... Then I just happened to pick the checkout with the worst employee I have ever encountered in ANY business.   He did nothing but look the other way yawning and rubbing his eyes the whole time I loaded the belt with ¬£160 worth of shopping as my son persistently screamed wanting to be picked up. Could he not have started scanning things and perhaps put a few things in bags for me? Maybe make a light joke? Ask if I needed any help? When I loaded everything on he then spoke the only few words he would say to me for that whole 15 minutes ordeal -  how many bags do you want?  (He didn t even tell me how much the shopping was at the end  he just looked at me awaiting to be handed payment.  He then watched me struggle to pack everything by myself  not once offering any help as concerned (and disgusted) shoppers looked on at how much I was struggling  my child screaming louder and louder.   By the time I left your store I was in floods of tears  an experience I do not EVER want to repeat.   It should probably also be brought to your attention that when a similar thing in happened in Sainsburys just before Christmas I had 2 additional people come to my rescue and pack all of my shopping up for me - what a difference that intuition and compassion made to my trip.  I will now shop with the supermarket that I feel more welcome with and better meets my needs as a mother shopping with a toddler.

Right now in your bishop Auckland store you have a line at the customer service desk. And the tabacco kiosk.  Security have confirmed the same person is running both.  Customers are walking out. If I didn t have a full shop to do I would do the same.   Not very good at all  is it?					2016-01-02T10:50:49+0000	1451731849	2016-01-02 11:50:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We went into store to be told that they have instructions not to deal with the Hudl. We then called the helpline who said in the first conversation that it was likely to be our fault and to send photos.  They confirmed that we have damaged the port and that we can pay for a repair.  Given the number of complaints on the internet of the same issue it is clearly a known issue and weakness in the Hudl. The power lead has only been used twice by an adult who has plenty of experience with the same lead and mobile phones without any problems.  Extremely disappointed daughter and parents. Do not touch the Hudl.  We will not ever be shopping at Tesco.					2016-01-02T09:43:02+0000	1451727782	2016-01-02 10:43:02	0	16	0	0	16	15	11	4	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I work in a customer facing job and found this to be very unprofessional. Maybe you need to train your nightstaff again at this store. Also when i asked to see the manager i was told he was not available to justify his decision to close the top floor.

I went to the baby section to get my daughters  milk and noticed that several of the milk cartons were missing the security seal on the front of the cow and gate box  I informed a member of staff to be told  well they re sealed on the inside  I find this disgusting as the milk could very well have been tampered with and needs to be removed from the shelves.					2016-01-01T16:11:56+0000	1451664716	2016-01-01 17:11:56	1	7	1	0	8	7	3	4	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The smell was delicious it took an extra 30 mins to cook instead of 1 hour 30 mins then there was more fat than pork meat and the stuffing was overly greasy to the point my son vomited pure grease. Tescos sort this out its meant to be meat NOT fat.

Got a bit of a problem..Went in your lovely Walkden 24Hr store today..   Saw a Goodmans sound bar on Sale ¬£22.00..   Bargain I thought. After a swift phone call I decided to buy it..   Opened it found the bags with all the wires in had been opened..  Ex display I thought but alas no..   It had a crhristmas card in from Agnus with love to Tom...   I find this very strange could you advise me on what to do next?  I purchased this item on the understanding it was new and not second hand......					2016-01-01T15:16:59+0000	1451661419	2016-01-01 16:16:59	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

If you bank with natwest DO NOT USE TESCOS! Their machines are all screwing the cards up  which means next step is an atm to reset the card....if that doesn t work then it s the bank....and if they can t a new one needs to be sent out. Bloody awesome  nice to see no notices up warning customers or sales assistants letting you know instead they just say everyone is having a problem  no they re not as I ve used my card in other places today all ok!  its only Tescos that have the problem!  So massive thank you to Tescos for your complete selfish service and greed!  Share this and make sure you have cash in your pocket!!					2016-01-01T15:06:07+0000	1451660767	2016-01-01 16:06:07	0	9	0	0	9	9	8	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You need to get this sorted so your website has a correct view of what stock you have.

My OH went to our local store (15 min drive away) and purchased a lot of frozen food.  At the till the lady said to him he was entitled to a free freezer bag and then asked someone to go and get it for him.  She stated it needed to be scanned and when he s got home he told me and then checked the receipt to which he s been charged ¬£3.99 for it.  He had all his bags for life with him  so didn t actually need it.  He s since phoned the store involved and spoken to a man who had a Scottish accent who said he shouldn t have got one for free and he s been charged correctly and to take it back for a refund.  He asked if he wanted to find the person involved as obviously she is misleading the public and then deceiving them by taking money by deception but he wasn t at all interested.  This isn t a good start for the New Year for Tesco s and really needs to be looked into  it would be a shame for you to get into trouble via Trading Standards something a member of your staff  had he been bothered could have dealt with.  Thank you for your time and look forward to hearing from you.					2016-01-01T12:29:18+0000	1451651358	2016-01-01 13:29:18	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Some times the smallest gestures can make a huge difference!  Thanks Tesco! X					2016-01-01T10:43:24+0000	1451645004	2016-01-01 11:43:24	11	1	11	0	12	1	1	0	1	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0
