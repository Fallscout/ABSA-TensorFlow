I work at a local primary school and asked what happened to the Halloween bunting and the very large cardboard spooky house after Halloween  as the possibilities for enhancing learning at school were endless and they couldn t have done more to help after saying I could take it! The team dismantled it for me  helped me carry it to my car and were genuinely interested in what I would do with it and were pleased for it to go to a good home! Great customer service and such a willingness to help when I m sure it would have been much easier for them to just bin it!  Thank you so much :)  From a very happy Reception teacher & no doubt some very excited children in the morning!					2016-10-31T21:22:42+0000	1477948962	2016-10-31 22:22:42	69	14	73	2	89	14	7	7	14	0	69	4	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter went to have one after dinner  and thankfully checked the date!     they are 11 days out of date    the use by date is 20 October!! This would have made her very ill. When I informed My husband he said there was lots of them there  so there may be more with that date? Please check so that no one gets ill..... This is the second time this has happened.

I spent about ¬£30 on my daily shop and after I paid for my shopping I queried how can I vote. I was informed that because I did not purchased a carrier bag I could not vote. Really! I thought that the whole point of supermarkets charging for carrier bags is to reduce the usage of them and now if I would like to vote I am being encourage to purchase a bag I don t need? Why? I would understand if Tesco put a limit -  lets say of ¬£10 of money spent on shopping before customer is allowed to vote  but encouraging plastic bag purchasing seems wrong! Please  can you explain to me the reasoning behind Tesco s thinking for having to purchase a disposable bag to be allowed to vote? Surely spending money on shopping should be enough to qualify to vote. Thank you.					2016-10-31T20:09:22+0000	1477944562	2016-10-31 21:09:22	0	7	0	1	8	7	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were really pleased to have saved just shy of ¬£50 worth of Clubcard vouchers which we thought would double up to ¬£100 with  Tesco Direct  to put towards Christmas presents for our daughter.   Imagine our disappointment to find out that this is no longer the case having read a poorly publicised article stating that the last ever event was last May. It has also taken the edge off the card we received from Tesco celebrating our 350th shop with you and a slightly ironic award of an extra 250 Clubcard points!  With the cost of living increasing rapidly again  this really would have assisted with the expense of Christmas. Not the way to keep customers I m afraid :(.					2016-10-31T20:06:38+0000	1477944398	2016-10-31 21:06:38	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not what I asked for and now completely wrecked what I had planned for dinner. For the money I paid am really disappointed.					2016-10-31T19:57:42+0000	1477943862	2016-10-31 20:57:42	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was helping out at the SSAFA Big Brew Up at RAF Lossiemouth today  which was supported by Tesco Elgin  and Lynda was there representing Tesco. As well as making numerous cuppas  she also spent time playing with my shy 3 year old  who normally wouldn t say boo to a goose in the company of strangers! Lynda was friendly and interested in what Eve had to say  as well as spending a good while playing with her with balloons! I think Eve might be a little bit in love with her now! People are quick enough to complain and moan so it s only fair to give praise where it s due too! Lynda is a credit to your Elgin store and the company üòÄ	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14910374_10153838032181510_6282606927479439771_n.jpg?oh=bd4898cbf1c1bd0e47ee8f250c428c6c&oe=58EE8527	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/14910374_10153838032181510_6282606927479439771_n.jpg?oh=bfabe354fb6eb4219a6c53f2570d7fa9&oe=591CA234	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153838032181510&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-31T19:40:54+0000	1477942854	2016-10-31 20:40:54	79	10	91	1	102	10	10	0	6	0	78	12	0	0	0	0	0

I am so angry I have felt the need to post my problems on here to warn other customers how misleading and unhelpful your company is.   Last night my husband and I spent a few hours surfing the internet for presents for our daughter. Tesco had what we thought was an excellent 3 for 2 offer on toys. This offer made Tesco the cheapest place to buy the 3 toys a total of ¬£65.   All of their toys clearly state with a red sticker if they are on the 3 for 2 offer on the website. Other items we would have purchased clearly stated they were out of stock or not included in the offer.   So we clicked on our 3 selected items and added them to basket. No item showed as free. We were perplexed  baring in mind this was 10pm and we have 2 small children running around and demanding attention from 7am. We were tired!!!   Thinking we had missed something we removed the items and tried again. Same thing. All 3 times showing with none free.   It was late so we just ordered them and thought we d go to store in the morning and sort it out. After a trip to our local store we were sent back to Tesco direct to sort them problem.   After a quick chat they informed me one of the toys was in fact out of stock with Tesco and was provided by a 3rd party which is why we didn t get one free.   At no point the the website alert me to the fact this one toy was not included in the offer or that I had missed an offer as I had added two qualifying items.    So here s my problem. They stated they were unable to refund any item separately or add another item to our order. They could only refund the entire order when it was delivered to the store. The refund would then take 3-5 working days to clear back to my bank account. I could then re-order the items required  but hang on the offer on toys ends tonight.   No like most hard working parents of two small children and two teenagers I don t have a spare ¬£90 in my bank account.   So now am I left with no toys and no money for toys for my daughters birthday present which is on Friday and all I got from YOU Tesco was sorry you (as in me) should have noticed!!!!!  Well Tesco I spend thousands of pounds at your petrol station every year as I do a 65 mile round trip to work every day. Plus all the food shopping and clothes for our 4 children. Guess what your not having my custom any more!!! Something tells me the bigger picture is your loss not mine!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-0/s130x130/14479511_10154546621067165_6603654968320502641_n.jpg?oh=c79871406b88b4f6ec3082fa41f4e70b&oe=58D940DF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-9/s720x720/14479511_10154546621067165_6603654968320502641_n.jpg?oh=a43728a94ebb3a46a4a893228c281990&oe=58DBBED2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154546621067165&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-31T18:55:57+0000	1477940157	2016-10-31 19:55:57	0	8	0	0	8	8	5	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This evening I received a phone call from  ALRIC  on behalf of Tesco  who advised me there was a problem with my payment.  There was no problem in rectifying this problem  as I was very happy to confirm all details of the payment and correct any errors that had clearly occurred (as the payment had shown cleared on my account the day before). However  throughout the entire telephone conversation  I found  Alric  to be extremely short tempered  abrupt and bordering rude to me.  I found this completely unnecessary as it was obviously a hiccup within the system and  Alric  was not at all representative of the excellent customer service that I would expect from Tesco.  It took a long time for him to explain the situation to me (he went all round the houses with it - confusing himself and me!)  hence it took  longer than it really should have to reach a resolution - an error in the expiry date as it turned out.  He made me feel very negative about a situation that could have been sorted far quicker had he adopted a more positive attitude.  Very disappointing customer service from Tesco!					2016-10-31T18:10:16+0000	1477937416	2016-10-31 19:10:16	2	9	2	0	11	8	5	3	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Before I made my way there I called to check that they did in fact have stock. The automated message stated that stock could not be checked and items could not be reserved-great service. I still spoke to a lovely lady who confirmed that the offer was still on in store and as I would have to travel there by myself with a one year old during rush hour  offered to check the stock for me- there were seven in store. So we travelled to the store  got the three etch a sketches  but as they weren t in the toy aisle I went to customer services to check. The lady searched and came back and said that they were on the tills as stationary and so was not part of the offer. This meant that instead of paying the ¬£24 had I been able to buy them online  I would have to pay ¬£45. I explained about the phone call and how on the website they were a different price and in the offer. The explanation I was given was that they had had a few things like that. Needless to say  I wont be trusting the website or phone calls again.					2016-10-31T17:12:44+0000	1477933964	2016-10-31 18:12:44	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When asked when will the next delivery come  the customer advisor did not know. My husband and I have found more recently that the selection is not a good as it used to be. For example we haven t seen a marrow on the shelves for a few months. I am certainly contemplating either changing to a different shopermarket or having to travel further afield to Tescos in Milton Keynes to get the choices we like.					2016-10-31T16:39:54+0000	1477931994	2016-10-31 17:39:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We go into tesco and pick it up there s a small hole but we don t think anything of it.  We get home and before we can even start to carve it we notice 3 little squrming maggots on the pumpkin and a foul retched stench  obviously we started to asume  that the pumpkin has gone off (by the way they didn t have dates on)   I called up tesco to ask what we can do and see if there was anyway to get a refund but am rudely told that  all we can do is apologise    It genuinely makes me feel sick they don t have people checking these pumpkins well enough to notice when one has gone out of date. There where maggots in a food store and where small children go with their family to get fresh food.  The inside was BLACK and smelt like a corpse   filled with maggots and God knows what else could of been hiding in there.  Since all they can do is apologies all I can do is write a status.

At home I use quorn chicken and make bbq chicken and salad rolls  hullumi and sweet chilli wraps  quorn chicken and sweetcorn rolls; the list is endless. ...however when I m in a rush or fancy a quick fix   I am so sick of the only options for veggies in Tescos ready made sections being something with cheese; cheese and onion  cheese and pickle  cheddar ploughman or egg; egg and cress or egg mayo. The only other option is a falafel wrap which tastes disgusting and on the very very odd occasion a three bean wrap which are not in very often. After 3 years it gets very very boring... Wish supermarkets would realise that we do actually eat other things. I understand Quorn is a product of its own so supermarkets maybe can t use it in their fillings  but the same old cheddar cheese or egg and cress is very old and very bland next to all the exciting new flavours brought out for meat eaters. Even Asda have cottoned on and have at least brought out a veggie sushi which changes things up a little. Really wish you would sort this out Tesco :(					2016-10-31T15:32:37+0000	1477927957	2016-10-31 16:32:37	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Blatant lie as still able to buy the item but at a much more expensive price. Either honour your own mistakes or man up and tell the truth. Disgusted.

My tesco order  due between 8 and 9pm last night didn t arrive.  Had a voicemail just after 9 saying he was just coming up to the Runcorn bridge and would be another half an hour.  Didn t arrive.  A couple of hours later tweeted them and contacted them via the website.  I ve just phoned and apparently my shopping had been delivered the van came back empty and the delivery was signed for!!  It contained sweets for Halloween  so thanks Tesco driver  that s great!!!  I ve had to re-book the delivery for tomorrow and pay out again until they can refund me.  I m on benefits  so thanks for that and also  I have agoraphobia  so can t get out to buy more sweets  so sorry kids  I ll just have to ignore you tonight. Fuming!  I thought the vans were all tracked now anyway so how don t they know if he came to our address or not.  They re going to phone me when they talk to the driver later.  I can t wait to see what he has to say.					2016-10-31T13:20:10+0000	1477920010	2016-10-31 14:20:10	0	10	0	0	10	10	1	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What is it with you people and plastic packaging? After an early start with the chores on this beautiful autumn morning  I thought I d take a break from the usual healthy eating and treat myself to a nice thick bacon sandwich. Great I thought  this will hit the spot. That was before I was confronted by a sinister enemy that just wasn t prepared to go down without a fight  the bacon. Now I know I m not exactly built like Arnold Scwarzenegger but I like to think that I m a reasonably strong man and should have no problem opening a packet of bacon  especially when those nice Tesco people have left a convenient little flap on the corner of the packet to be able to peel back the lid. However  this was anything but the case because your suppliers seem to be under the impression that the product shouldn t be just sealed but arc welded too. After the first few attempts just slipped through the fingers (very little purchase on such a small area of plastic). I know  I thought to myself  I ll get my thumbnail under it  that should give me the necessary leverage. CRACK! No it didn t  it just broke my thumbnail. Next it was on to using my teeth (not very hygienic I know but by now desperation is setting in) and more to the point this didn t work either  it just kept slipping through my clenched teeth. By now  even though I m a pretty laid back kind of guy  I m starting to take it personally and finally decided I needed backup  The Knife. I realised immediately that this was too big a job for a simple table knife and was going to require the stabbing skills of a pointed knife  preferably with a serrated edge. So  armed with my favourite 6 inch blade I set off on my latest mission. Approaching the packet of bacon for the umpteenth time  like a marine storming a foreign beach in wartime I was filled with adrenalin and a mixture of excitement  fear  anger and bravado. I even said to the pack  let s see what you ve got. This time it s just you  me and the knife . It s at this point I finally lost the war and my appetite for bacon  because the knife decided to defect to the other side by refusing to pierce the film but slide off of it and stab my other hand instead. This isn t the first time I ve had to do battle with a packet of bacon but if a hospital trip is the price of a bacon sandwich it sure will be the last.					2016-10-31T11:58:10+0000	1477915090	2016-10-31 12:58:10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner accepted the delivery. In my receipt theres one item with a short date (beef mince 30/10/16) which we accepted. Upon further inspection  there werw a number of products with short dates that we weren t made aware of.  Chicken breast fillets - 30/10/16 Kingsmill wholemeal crustless bread -30/10/16 Strawberries - 29/10/16 Weight watchers wraps - 28/10/16  Why weren t these products pointed out to us? I d have certainly returned some of them at the time had we been made aware of the short dates :(					2016-10-31T11:49:02+0000	1477914542	2016-10-31 12:49:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

First we received this message   Thank you for your message  I have checked the progress of your repair and can confirm that unfortunately your item was found to be beyond economic repair.   As this item is over 3 years of age due to depreciation there is no residual value left to refund.   This item has now been put through our internal recycling process on your behalf.   If we can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us.   Kind regards   Chris   Customer Service Representative  Tesco Outlet  Since the television had only been used for about 2 hours a week  we asked for a partial refund. We received this reply from you   Thank you for your message   As your product was was out of warranty what the issue was reported to us on the 20.9.16  however in line with your consumer rights we offered to return your item for possible repair. Unfortunately due to the age of the system replacement components had become obsolete and and therfore rendered the unit beyond economic repair.    As the item exceeds three years of age we contest that this item had any intrinsic fault  as such faults normally found within the first six months of usage. In addition with regards to any information provided to the amount of usage as this can not be substantiated it is nothing more than hearsay and superfluous to our decision.   This decision is final and we are not prepared to enter into any discussion with regards to a compensation claim.   Kind regards   Chris ‚Äã  Customer Service Representative  Tesco Outlet  I don t accept that 200 hours of use is an acceptable length of service for a television. Clearly it was designed badly or it was made badly.   Are you really not willing even to entertain any responsibility for selling this item?

Times must be hard for Tesco these days as none of these offers apply any longer other than the ¬£6 a month delivery saver and even at that you have to spend ¬£40 now. Which means if your driver forgets to give you half of your shopping and leaves you with 3 half dinners (like what happened to me on Saturday) and you have to reorder the stuff  you have to order a load of stuff you don t need just to meet the minimum delivery. No money off vouchers any more  no clubcard boost  no petrol discounts. Nothing. Not much reason to be loyal to Tesco any more. This comes from someone who posted on your wall a year ago saying how good it was to be a Tesco customer. Not feeling loved any more Tesco. You ve really let yourself go.					2016-10-31T11:13:00+0000	1477912380	2016-10-31 12:13:00	3	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I paid the full amount for the four items and was told it could be more easily sorted out at customer services. I went to customer services where the assistant asked if I was sure I had actually picked the items from the ¬£10 Meal Deal display? Where the Hell did she think I d got them from? There was not enough staff to check if I had indeed picked up the correct combination for a Meal Deal so she offered me a refund on the said items. I suspect the culprit was the wine  it usually is. I m not sure of the intelligence level of your shelf fillers but I can tell you this isn t the first time it has happened. I felt cheated and annoyed as I left the store and I also  more importantly  didn t feel valued as a customer. In fact I felt as if my honesty had been doubted too. Perhaps  instead of encouraging your staff to wear amusing Hallowe en costumes you could teach them a bit more about customer service and courtesy though to be honest more staff would be more of a help. The poor witch was manning the Customer Service desk alone. I ve sent this as a message with till receipts attached............in case you doubt me.					2016-10-31T11:10:52+0000	1477912252	2016-10-31 12:10:52	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Recently my wonderful neighbours donated this cat litter to us. Sadly their cat Pumpkin passed away (rip sweetheart)  Now we foster a LOT of cats and kittens  we come across them daily in our line of work. We set up a ltd company that works hard in trying to reunite owners with lost pets. Animals Lost and Found in Kent.   What can I say about this litter? Well it s AWESOME for ginger cats  it truly accentuates their natural tones and highlighted fur beautifully... Not so great on white pawed kittens (photo in comments) I m guessing they wanted to be oompa loompas for Halloween? Or found a tomato soup puddle? Either way they re stomping around proud to be orange today.   Now to the annoying part... I scrubbed the floor on all fours this morning  kittens smell  they kick poo around the room and when they eat they make a mess and it has to be scrubbed regularly  I got to the doorway... Turned around to bask in the glory of the room smelling fresh and HORROR there was a haze of orange powder residue all over the floor. I reached for your anti+bac floor wipes and redid the floor. Satisfied I d got it all I waited for it to dry and again... It s still there! What do I do now? Is this stuff safe for kittens? I could discontinue using it  but I won t as it s been kindly donated. We re on day two. Will this get worse?   Just a heads up  rebrand this as  tanning beads  and put it in the beauty aisle - you could add an extra tenner on the bag! ... This stuff actually works on skin!   But for now  the cream five foot cat scratcher is now orange  the white toy mice resemble odd shaped goldfish and I m struggling to keep the kitten room looking like the tango man hasn t sneezed all over it! Send in the cleaners!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14938152_10155124929447662_2045905796631984380_n.jpg?oh=ea5716a5bb80d1dad50dda7eb8fddde2&oe=592212D9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14938152_10155124929447662_2045905796631984380_n.jpg?oh=77caba769d46019a0cd59b85a5ea8ffb&oe=591C4ED4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155124929447662&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-31T11:03:05+0000	1477911785	2016-10-31 12:03:05	0	4	6	2	12	4	3	1	10	0	0	0	1	5	0	0	0

Having had a multitude of delivery from the Leighton buzzard branch with little or no problems for years. Since moving and having possibly approx 8 deliveries so far they have been consistently late texting me later times I have had numerous items missing. On one delivery my husband found glass in one of the bags. This is now becoming a joke Tescos. Today I have arrangements and need to leave at 11.20am hence I arranged a slot of 10-11am and yet again you cannot commit. I requested a call back from the store last time it happened and I am still awaiting. This is the last time now I spend thousands with you and if the Kingston store in Milton Keynes cannot cope then don t offer it or better still see how the Leighton buzzard branch do it. The store is a disgrace. !!!!!					2016-10-31T10:39:48+0000	1477910388	2016-10-31 11:39:48	3	4	3	2	9	4	1	3	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

He came back to it the other morning after popping in to get some items for lunch at work and found a parking charge notice for ¬£100 stuck to it.  We watched the Arena store being built as we live about a 7 minute wall from Tesco s doors.  We as a family have used this store for our weekly shopping  our petrol and as a  corner store  as we live so close to it and can use it when we need one-off or essential items at various times of the day/night. Although it is a very large shop  because we use it so often we get to know some of the staff and value that personal welcome that you miss in some of the larger stores. However  to now be  fined  for parking his scooter where he has parked for years (and not in anyones way) is just a kick in the teeth from Tesco Management.  Tesco Management must value the income from these car parking companies but this ticket was unfair as my husband parked near to some support pillars (but out of everyone s way so as not to cause an obstruction) to protect his scooter from the car drivers who reverse into your motorbike or scooter and then drive off. Believe me it happens! I am so sad that it has come to this from a shop we enjoyed using.					2016-10-31T10:28:47+0000	1477909727	2016-10-31 11:28:47	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Over the weekend I planned to buy some toys for Xmas in your 3 for 2 sale. Well what do you know.....it s not really a 3 for 2 sale when buying online is it? It only works on certain toys that are supplied directly from tesco not ALL toys like you say. Out of 6 items I put in my basket only 2 were included in the offer. Couldn t phone over the weekend as tesco direct line isn t operated then. Well tesco  I m taking my ¬£200 I was going to spend on your offer and giving it to toyrus for their sale. Your advertisement for this offer is totally misleading and quite frankly a con if you have to buy online. If I went into one of your larger stores these toys would be on the shelves included in 3 for 2 wouldn t they? We only have a small store here so we a stuffed basically and miss out???					2016-10-31T10:11:33+0000	1477908693	2016-10-31 11:11:33	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ended up getting a flat tyre on my way this morning to pick up a few bits for the children for Halloween tonight. Both children with me age 1 and 2  I went into the customer service and explained the situation. Alison ran around the store looking for someone who could help me and then found the manager Daryl who changed the tyre for me  while I continued my shop. Very happy customer thank you so much for your help!					2016-10-31T10:09:11+0000	1477908551	2016-10-31 11:09:11	24	1	29	7	37	1	1	0	4	0	24	5	0	0	0	0	0

You state you have flexible options regarding your contracts in your employment handbook for parental leave and it s nothing but words. Threatening to sack my wife who suffers from anxiety just because a change in circumstances has forced her to give up her Sunday shift to look after our children. It s disgusting.

I bought this for my 11 month old as our new house has only a shower cubicle.  At 11 months she can sit perfectly but obviously I never move away while she is in the bath. This bath is so slippy it really is unsafe. As she was playing she slipped around  i managed to catch her arm before she went under the water but in the process she banged the side of her face/eye on the high side of the bath leaving a very red mark on her face....Could ve been much worse. Why don t your baby baths have non-slip stickers in the bottom? i know they re probably not designed for older more mobile babies but i m sure parents of new borns must have the same issue with them sliding about while trying to bath them one handed!					2016-10-31T09:35:55+0000	1477906555	2016-10-31 10:35:55	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No call to explain  even after I d reported it  zero explanation. On hold on three occasions for in excess of 10 minutes  until someone declared  it s not one that we d be able to redeliver - would you like me to cancel it?  Like he was doing me a favour.

I went in looking for a micro hdmi cable and the shop was getting a refit by the looks of it. So I can understand staff may be harassed but it was not busy. I asked politely for help so not to go near the workmen and I got a sigh when I asked about the cable and got a very blunt aw we will never find it in there. Woman went off and came back and said we don t know as it could be anywhere. So left empty handed felt like I was made to feel like I had inconvenienced her. I feel if you are that harassed and can t be bothered to look for stock maybe you should close a shop for an hour or two during a refit. Sorry Tesco I shop here and I am a regular customer but left feeling very dissatisfied with the lack of customer service in store.

I understand there has been done improvements made but some just appear stupid.   1. the trolley shelters in the car park were all ripped out to make way for new ones fair enough they look nicer but why were they not put on the purpose laid concrete pads that the old ones were on ? They have all been put 2 spaces away.  2. Having revamped the bakery in the same store it now seems that to get a fresh in store loaf we must now choose a loaf that is no longer per wrapped in perforated plastic as it has been for many many years. And now must choose a loaf that has already had many other customers hands all over it and put in a bag ourselves. Then fight with the self service checkout to find the item rather than just scan it.  3. Now the aisle markers have been moved to the end of the aisles there is a lot less info on them.  4. Cigarette/lotto/click&collect/customer service counter. There now appears to be too many things going on at this counter and no logical queing for each part causing long delays to anyone using the services offered there					2016-10-30T20:08:25+0000	1477858105	2016-10-30 21:08:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only was he on his own and rushed off his feet  he was very cheerful  no one felt neglected  and exceptionally helpful - when he went on his well earned break he came with me to my car and connected my new phone to the bluetooth for me (as I was really struggling)  using his own phone to google how to do it on my make and model of car.  What a thoroughly nice young man who deserves some recognition!					2016-10-30T19:06:39+0000	1477854399	2016-10-30 20:06:39	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son is allergic to dairy and does not like the unsweetened one. Had to buy alpro brand which was 50p a litre more expensive!  You seem to be cutting back on this range.

When arriving at the check-out she decided to tell my partner without prompting  he s outgrown that seat and he doesn t like laying down like that  (the seat she was talking about is part of our pram age range 6M-3Y (my son is 11M) I know I may not have been anything too offensive that she said but for my partner the tone in which she said it and responded when he challenged her statements is just not acceptable. In future could you tell your staff members to keep their inaccurate opinions to themselves unless asked.					2016-10-30T18:27:52+0000	1477852072	2016-10-30 19:27:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When it s warm and spread with Lurpak it s the perfect partner to your equally fab tortellini (and frequently the reason why my fianc√© and I fail our low carb diets!) On Thursday I was shopping for my usual daily groceries in your Knaresborough High Street store and saw there was a Three Cheese loaf left in the bakery.  Great! Added to basket with the pasta and thinking  the diet can start again tomorrow . I got home to find a second Three Cheese Bloomer in my kitchen that my fianc√© had purchased from the same store earlier in the day (great minds think alike and it s our favourite bread!) Only later on when I cut into a load did I realise there was NO CHEESE! üò± I cut into the second loaf and alas that too was totally cheese-less. I double checked the packaging to make sure we d picked up the right products but they were both definitely packaged as Three Cheese Bloomers (photos in comments) I think somebody in your bakery/packaging department may have made a tiny mistake and used a Three Cheese Bloomer wrapper for a boring regular White Bloomer (I cannot stress the disappointment this causes to cheese fans...) We ate the bread with the pasta as planned and it didn t ruin our weekend but I am confused. Is this a sign from the Gods telling me to stick to a low carb diet? Please help! üôè					2016-10-30T18:03:39+0000	1477850619	2016-10-30 19:03:39	1	7	1	0	8	7	6	1	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As we was walking to our local park we spied one of your trucks delivering to someone. My three year old loves cars/lorries/vans etc so we pointed it out and was talking about the fruit and vegetables on the truck when the driver turned the van around and pulled over by us and started talking to us   he then gave my little man a chocolate apple and Halloween activity pack. (He also offered us one for our one year old as well  which we politely declined and am now kicking myself I didn t accept so I could eat it as my little dudes chocolate apple smells so scrummy! üôäüòÇ).   I just wanted to say a big thank you for this random act of kindness from your driver this afternoon üòÉ in went a long way as it s been a very looooong day here what with the clocks changing and someone starting the day at 5am! üò¥  Thanks From the L-Bs of Chislehurst  Kent.					2016-10-30T17:10:11+0000	1477847411	2016-10-30 18:10:11	12	1	13	2	16	1	1	0	0	0	12	1	0	0	0	0	0

I understand you have merged F&F with Tesco direct and I understand delivery charges which were once not applicable are now in operation and it is the customers choice to do the click and collect or pay the delivery charge ( i opt for click and collect  I do miss the free delivery option on the clothes after a certain spend amount) I have just purchased some clothes and when I came to pay was very sad with what I say  some of the clothes I had purchased  despite being sold in your store and not through an associate on your website there was no click and collection option and the system forced me to pay the delivery charge. What is your explanation for this  forcing people to pay? One unhappy customer.					2016-10-30T15:02:29+0000	1477839749	2016-10-30 16:02:29	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just been to your Aylesbury Tring road branch and they re even worse there! Yes it s only one day until Halloween but surely someone should be taking the mouldy pumpkins out because they ll make all the others mouldy and if they re all mouldy you should take them off of sale. It s extremely off-putting when they absolutely stink and there are flies all around them and you still expect customers to pay ¬£3 for 2!! I got some of the mouldy pulp on my hand which ended up on my daughter s pushchair handle and when I got home I realised there was some on the sleeve of my brand new top! Not impressed Tesco!

I cheekily bought this child s Cape in the sale last year. Finally opening it today  I unravelled it to find a dirty black sock balled up in the middle of it - eeeeew!! The packet had not been tampered with at all so I assume it s been put in when it was packaged. I hope there s not a poor lady been wandering around in China for a year with only one sock!

I appreciate you have a small selection in your frozen section but would absolutely love to see some more please  also a few more choices in the cheese and red wine section would be amazing  save us having to drive to Canterbury to do our shopping.  To all the other vegans in Thanet  if you agree with this request  how about showing your support  lets get the supermarkets on board.

We have visited Tesco on multiple occasions (2 different local stores) in the past weeks and to describe the trip as frustrating would be an understatement. My grandmother uses a wheelchair  which I push around. Accordingly  we use the adapted trolleys available at your stores which attach to the wheelchair. The problem does not lie in attaching the trolley to the wheelchair but in maneuvering the trolley around the store.  Whenever we attempt to reverse the trolley the wheels hit the front of the wheelchair or my grandmothers foot/ankle. After this it is a nightmare to free the wheel of the trolley which becomes stuck and immobile behind the front of the wheelchair. During our most recent visit  we had to ask for the help of an employee who could do nothing more than kick the wheel of the trolley until it became free and mobile again. In addition  on the same trip we became stuck in front of the checkouts and a fellow shopper had to help us free the wheel. Sometimes we can be stuck in this position for many minutes and not only does it delay us but it can also be embarrassing. This is especially so for my grandmother who is trying to regain mobility and does not wish to draw attention to herself in the wheelchair as it is  despite the fact that I am constantly reminding her in the modern world there should be no accessibility problems.  I am sure we cannot be the only people who are inconvenienced in such a manner and  if we are honest  it puts us off returning to your stores despite the fact that my grandmother has been a clubcard holder for years.					2016-10-30T12:56:12+0000	1477832172	2016-10-30 13:56:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After cutting the lid off we discovered the inside was rotten !

Orange squash perhaps? Gravy maybe? Do you not understand the concept of a dairy free product as an alternative for people who cannot have dairy products? There are precious few dairy free alternatives as it is & you decide to make that list shorter ( you have also decided not to sell Alpro chocolate dessets   milk & dark  as well  so well done  you really know how to annoy your customers.) I have sent a PM to you about this but wanted to highlight it here & find out what other customers who can t have dairy think about this.					2016-10-30T12:51:06+0000	1477831866	2016-10-30 13:51:06	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I contact customer services and am told that because 1 of the items I wanted is out of stock you will outsource it to another company- so I get my item  but that means I don t get 3 for 2 AND I have to pay 2 delivery charges?!   No thank you! I ll take my custom elsewhere.					2016-10-30T11:50:35+0000	1477828235	2016-10-30 12:50:35	0	8	1	0	9	8	3	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you tell me where in my area these are stocked please as its a big thing. This is the product im after and i would like a few if possible.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-0/p130x130/14610977_10157699540960444_3077026833146234053_n.jpg?oh=e1b03dac5f00d7fcefd1926815f44c76&oe=58DDEEB4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-9/14610977_10157699540960444_3077026833146234053_n.jpg?oh=03c7693db4413e6278478a3783cfd136&oe=58EB4259	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157699540960444&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-30T11:41:13+0000	1477827673	2016-10-30 12:41:13	2	23	3	1	27	23	4	19	10	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

To then be told my shopping was on another drivers van and he would deliver when he was in the area.  Its now Sunday and NO SHOPPING.   Thanks Tesco no Sunday dinner for me.  No explanation why they did not turn up or a call to say they were not coming.  Very disappointed Tesco.					2016-10-30T11:24:49+0000	1477826689	2016-10-30 12:24:49	0	3	0	1	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is an absolutely nonsense sentence spouted by your self service machines when you scan your club card.  It annoys me way more than it should.  Unless it s just a general reminder like  every little helps  and isn t actually anything to do with the recent addition of club card points. If this is the case  the way it is delivered is incorrect to portray the meaning.  Can you please change it to something like  Tesco points have been added to your total  which makes more sense.					2016-10-30T07:49:44+0000	1477813784	2016-10-30 08:49:44	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I boil the kettle  tip my sachet of healthy living chicken noodle soup in my mug and think yep this is going to hit the spot. I m on a diet  not that that relates to my consumption of cheesy pasta of course.   I pour the boiled water into my mug and stir continuously as instructed in order to dissolve that health giving powder.   There s a chunk. I try to smoosh it against the side of the mug thinking it could be some undissolved powder. Im a bit weary what with having to work an extra hour for free tonight  so hope it s just my weak arm meaning it won t smoosh. But no.   I consider it might be a crouton  but I upon checking the pack there is no croutons in it.   I spoon it out  take a tenuous bite and discover it s a piece of GRISTLE AND BONE!!   I know it s Halloween  bones an all that. But really  this caused me significant emotional distress.

(Don t usually take them out at night but have been at a party) we bought teething crystals  dummies  (for my 6 month old baby girl) rabbit food and a bottle of water for my son. And when we arrived at our check we found a checkier asleep  after waking her we paid for our items and got cash back and proceeded to leave the store... upon doing so we got stopped by said cashier and another member of staff only to be accused of stealing products that were already under our pushchair from the party that we had earlier been too. Just because we have 4 children I felt like we were steriotyped. My husband and myself work very hard to support our family and to be shouted at and embarrassed in front of our children and other customers is humiliating... we shall think twice before we choose to shop in tesco again. I cannot believe the lack of professionalism and the awful way that we were treated.					2016-10-29T21:25:13+0000	1477776313	2016-10-29 23:25:13	0	15	0	0	15	15	6	9	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I booked home delivery today for the 4.00-5.00pm slot... at 9.35pm it still hasn t arrived and no-one can tell us why.  Apparently  neither the driver nor the store are answering their phones for the last 4+ hours.  Surely that s a bit of a health and safety concern?!  Plus  I just got an email stating that my original order for ¬£177  will now cost ¬£211!!!  Seriously?!?  What part of this complete debacle is good customer service? I d love an explanation as I m at a loss for any rational explanation.  This does remind me why I haven t done a Tesco home delivery order in 11 months  as this is very similar to what happened last time.  I gave you the benefit of the doubt only to be let down again.					2016-10-29T20:40:47+0000	1477773647	2016-10-29 22:40:47	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am a regular shopper in your store and have been looking out for a product on offer in your electrical department which has been out of stock. Tonight around 6.10pm I visited your store to see if the product was in stock. After waiting for 15minutes in a queue at the electrical desk (where no one appeared) I left to do some shopping. I popped back to the (still empty) desk for another 5 minutes before I decided to pay at the checkouts. On my way to the electrical desk for a third time I approached the Customer Service desk to ask if there was someone available at electrics. The lady said there was a member of staff but that they were also covering fireworks. I asked the man if he was available and he asked me to wait again at the desk. After waiting a further 15mins I approached the customer service desk again where I was simply told no one was available to help me  not even to tell me whether the products were in stock let alone serve me. I think it s very poor service that despite being in your store for 45 mins and approaching 2 different members of staff no one was available to assist me. I could not wait any longer and so left your store feeling very disappointed.  Perhaps you should consider the allocation of staff in each department.					2016-10-29T20:36:51+0000	1477773411	2016-10-29 22:36:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your frozen free from tasted great before you decided to start using gram flour (derived from chick pea) in the majority of items  my child is severely anaphylaxis to wheat gluten egg nuts lentils pulses plus many other foods and fruits ...after discovering sainsbury (a few weeks ago)  had decided to change ingredients and started using gram flour in everything (which meant a whole range from one supermarket was no longer available) I started double checking all the regular bits we brought from your stores (feeling relieved and a happy 12yr old still be able to eat a few bits from your range) only to discover that Tesco had followed the herd and joined the gram flour bandwagon..I now have a miserable 12yr old that now cannot have anything from your supermarket either!! My 12 yr old says  please stop using gram flour and while I m moaning egg too in your freefrom...I have real allergies and while your concentrating on coeliacs and the range got really big recently ...you have completely forgotten about those of us with mulitple anaphylaxis allergies . So while your increasing your range for some your completely letting down others ...I walk in a supermarket and get nothing ...maybe you should try it and see whether your decisions are so great ...thank you for taking away what little food enjoyment I got Tesco!					2016-10-29T19:33:46+0000	1477769626	2016-10-29 21:33:46	3	2	7	1	10	2	2	0	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	4	0

We popped in to Tesco to see if we could spot a nice Christmas present for my daughter  and we did.  Two nice presents in fact.  And a fantastic looking Hot Wheels Advent calendar.  I agreed to get it  as it was part of the 3 for 2 offer on toys.  Unfortunately the Take n Play Thomas set wouldn t scan on our scanner  so when we got to the checkout we pressed the button to ask for assistance.  The assistance we got was very limited.  We were told that as the item didn t scan  then they couldn t sell it to us  but he did call over another assistant to try and help us.  The second assistant said exactly the same as the first  and the toy was taken away and put in a trolley with other items that were destined to go back on the shelves (I hope it wasn t put back on the shelf to disappoint another small child).  I explained to the assistant that we were getting three toys because of the 3 for 2 offer and asked what he could do to help us in this situation.  He repeated that he couldn t sell me the item  as it didn t scan in  and then wandered off to help another shopper. In the end we left without any of the toys  much to the disappointment of my five year old. There was no offer to try and help resolve things  just an insistence that I couldn t be sold the item.  Having worked in retail  I know that it is perfectly possible to resolve a situation like this to everyone s satisfaction. Please can you double check that items scan  before they go on the shelf  so that you don t get any more upset children who had been looking forward to getting their sister a lovely Christmas present.					2016-10-29T19:22:46+0000	1477768966	2016-10-29 21:22:46	0	10	1	0	11	10	2	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

My 3 year old son was bursting for the toilet and I d said he d have to hold on when a young lady (she had pink hair!) offered for us to use the toilet in the shop without us even asking. She took us through the back and even the staff back there working were so friendly to my son. Brilliant customer service.

My son in particular is tricky  being intolerant to wheat  dairy  soya and sesame (so far!) and our food journey with him has been a real challenge. We have shopped with you for years and have watched your free-from selection grow and develop which has helped us enormously. Recently I tweeted your customer services team wondering if there was any chance you could start stocking a particular brand of coconut yoghurts that we had only been able to find at an online rival that were the only brand our son liked as they weren t solid and very rich like other coconut yoghurts. For a child the other brands are too much to take  whereas one we found was more like regular yoghurts in consistency and flavour and he loved them. Jake from the team replied promptly and said he had logged it on the internal system so hopefully they d consider it. I walked into Tescos on Winwick Road in Warrington yesterday (which already has a fab selection for us) to find the fridge free-from selection massively expanded and the yoghurts I had requested sat on the shelf! Was absolutely over the moon  bought a tonne of them amongst other interesting new things we found in the section and had a very happy baby! Thank you so much for listening to your customers and making our lives as parents so much easier. And thank you from our happy children who can enjoy the same things as their friends.					2016-10-29T17:52:57+0000	1477763577	2016-10-29 19:52:57	5	3	6	0	9	3	2	1	3	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	0

Now I keep receiving a text from XinWin to tell me I have now joined the Tesco 500.00 draw for 4.50 a week unless I send stop to 88227.

Ordered a washing machine as go on holiday Thursday morning...waited in this morning...arrived...Lovely delivery guys....yet the brand new washing machine is broke  their installers couldn t believe it we d been sent one that hadn t been tested before leaving the manufacturer.  Now no washing machine...earliest we can get another delivered is Friday when we re already away...arrived we got was a ¬£20 off next purchase...what good is that tesco  were going to spend more than that at the launderette last minute for holiday clothes!  Expected to have at least got a replacement out in time. Very disappointed.					2016-10-29T16:22:25+0000	1477758145	2016-10-29 18:22:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your pharmacy at Clay Cross has got to be the worst run pharmacy in the country. I can t remember the last time I went to collect something from there where it wasn t lost. 9 out of ten times  I have to write down my repeat on a scrap of paper because the electronic prescription doesn t work  and they have lost the reorder slip.   What makes it worse is hearing the pharmacist calling names of other people waiting while they still are searching for mine  for them to give up and get it off the shelf and start again.   Confidence in patient safety? I wouldn t trust them to microwave a ready meal. Hint  it s in the microwave...					2016-10-29T16:09:04+0000	1477757344	2016-10-29 18:09:04	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A member of your staff  anne sat down with us while i had great fun colouring in my creepy picture  she explained that she is in charge of community projects and would like feedback on what everyone thinks about the work our store does.  I for one think its great  we ve been in a few times and the kids table has been out.  My lil girl always makes a bee line for it and if im honest i do too  we grown ups enjoy colouring in too üòÇ.  Today my wee one is super happy because she got a pumpkin to take home  a sweetie in her pocket  she had an apple and a juice while fair talking away to anne and colouring in her pumpkin.  Your employee  anne  has a heart of gold.  She spent hours today looking after kids while mums/dads went and got shopping  was happy to sit and colour with us grown ups too and she had such a positive cheerful attitude.  She definitely made my trip to tesco today a successful one with no temper tantrums from my wee one  well done and thankyou anne!					2016-10-29T14:45:59+0000	1477752359	2016-10-29 16:45:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought three items last night and paid full price  so I rang them today to be told I don t qualify for the 3 for 2 offer because they are not available through Tesco and and coming from third parties. No where on the payment page does it highlight this before you hit pay. Honestly I m so angry! How can you advertise a 3 for 2 like this? Good luck trying to find three items you want that TESCO have in stock is all I can say. Absolutely ridiculous.

My daughter went in looking for a toy (as usual) and came out with a free halloween bag she got to decorate herself in store along with a sweet and free tasters. She enjoyed visiting so much she forgot about the toy (to my delight). All staff are dressed to impress and extra helpful and in the spirt. A lovely lady helped my 5yr old daughter scan her pumpkins.  They are also doing face painting but we didn t have the time to wait around after my daughter took so long decorating her free halloween bag lol. Lovely customer experience today for me and my 5yr old.

(and yes my carving skills are rubbish)  However I think you possibly need to call your large pumpkins  large compared to a plum . The one on the left is from you ;)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14907677_10154618102516064_6051248021700304245_n.jpg?oh=efa9b5857b8b424f74f76b9cd8aec145&oe=58E97785	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14907677_10154618102516064_6051248021700304245_n.jpg?oh=ee12b7b2fe9a96b760d8e1fac5e215c6&oe=58E13F88	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154618102516064&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-29T13:11:13+0000	1477746673	2016-10-29 15:11:13	4	3	5	0	8	2	2	0	0	0	4	1	0	0	0	0	0

I have heard that you are no longer doing the Tesco Own Brand of Sliced Free From Bread (GF  WF & DF)  and no longer stock the Udi Bagel range - both of these products were my favourite and tasted as close to regular as possible. I am going to have a look at Morrisons and Aldi to see what else I can buy from them. Also I was disappointed to see that the Dairy Free Chilled section in my local (Top Valley  Nottingham) has been reduced to just a small section.					2016-10-29T12:10:46+0000	1477743046	2016-10-29 14:10:46	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my family do a big shop at your Pulborough store every week. Spend a fair amount of money. You need to have a serious word with your security guard as he has followed us round the shop as soon as my girlfriend openly put a case of champagne under the buggy as our basket was full. He then followed us around the shop as we went and purchased fresh meat and spent more money. Once we had paid he then went and stood in the doorway and blatantly looked under the buggy and gave us a funny look so I said  everything alright mate?  And he said  yeah and you?  Then went back into the store. He blatantly judged us because were young and have a pram. He doesnt know us at all  we spent a lot of money just then and do so every week and im sorry but idiots like that make us not want to even shop in the store anymore. Have a word please					2016-10-29T11:56:33+0000	1477742193	2016-10-29 13:56:33	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tried to find a Daily Mail newspaper in the appropriate rack   with the others. Not only did I take a few minutes finding one but the first 2 newspapers had the magazine (showing the Tv programmes for the week) removed. It seems like some customers like to do this without paying for the newspaper. Therefore everybody its vital to check that the magazine is inside before purchasing it. I ve told the manager about this and swift action should be taken to ensure this is ceased. It may be a difficult task to undertake though.

I ve just had my weekly delivery  which included a cake for my daughter s first birthday today. It was packed on it s side  and as such arrived squashed and cracked. The delivery lady refunded it without question  and allowed us to keep the smashed cake. Though I appreciate the thought  I m unable to go to the store today and have guests arriving this afternoon so am pretty disappointed in general. Could it be passed onto the store that this is not an acceptable way to pack celebration cakes??					2016-10-29T10:49:57+0000	1477738197	2016-10-29 12:49:57	0	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	4	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

I receive a text at 11.11am to tell me of the delay  with an unspecified time of when it will be available for collection . What use is that when we are sat here (with a very fed up toddler). Furthermore  a manager appears to apologies  but then informs us this happens most Saturday mornings and Friday nights. Then why aren t the slots blocked as unavailable or the problem is addressed?

My HOME switch was broken  Apple did not want to know they just wanted to sell off their discontinued range at by saying they do not undertake repairs of iPads.  Tesco wouldnt accept any responsibility for selling it as they insist on a Repair Report from Apple and only Apple which they know customers cannot get.  But you can actually access the HOME button by switching on the iPad and after a few tweaks the HOME buttom becomes a screen button.

I am vegan and use this store on a regular basis or used to I should say. All over Facebook in the vegan groups people are praising you for the increase in the range and space dedicated to products suitable for vegans and lactose free diets. However in this store it is very quickly disappearing!  It is not convenient for me to traipse across town to the other store so I am afraid you have lost me as a customer unless you get it sorted out.					2016-10-29T08:31:04+0000	1477729864	2016-10-29 10:31:04	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I find it disgusting when staff members of any business choose to take their cigarette breaks in the customer carpark  But when the staff of your store choose to congregate right next to the parent and child parking spaces it is appalling.  This week I had to get my 7 week old baby out of the car into a cloud of smoke caused by the 6 members of staff sat smoking right next to the parent and baby section of the car park. I suggest an area out of sight and   Health risk to your customers should be considered.					2016-10-28T22:08:21+0000	1477692501	2016-10-29 00:08:21	3	5	4	0	9	5	2	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	1	0

I m 99.9% sure it said on the packaging  Make a wish . It definitely says  Make a wisah . Seems like one of your employee s didn t get a GCSE in English. Luckily I like things that are a bit different so I m not overly bothered  it actually cheered me up. I m just a tad concerned tomorrow when Harris blows out his candles he s going to make a wisah instead of a wish. I can guess now it s probably going to be something like  I wisah I was Spider-Man  or  I wisah I had a lifetime supply of cheese and my own tiger . The last one might be my wisah. But if he s not Spider-Man at some point in his life he ll always blame that 7th birthday wisah. So I m warning you in advance Tesco  Harris may come for vengance in the near future.

We have been buying Morrisons and sainsbury nappies for using in the car and reusables at home  more recently we ve been using disposables more frequently   we ve never had any problems until recently when we thought we d try Tesco nappies! I ve not been impressed because every night despite changing her we have had leaks and had to use reusables instead. But never did I expect these disposables to be a danger to my daughter.  My poor 3 month old has been miserable all afternoon  apart from a brief while when she had some nappy free time and then we went for a walk and she had a nap. Ive just changed her nappy again to get her ready for bed and I ve noticed a tiny cut where the nappy sits. It looks like a paper cut caused by the nappy. My poor baby has been cut by one of these horrendous nappies. I am extremely unhappy and so is my daughter.

Please do not ignore this drunken message of distress (thank you for putting barefoot moscato on offer... though mad you was out of stock of the bubbly variety).  Anyway on with my tale of horrors.  Picture this... I m sat with a large glass of the previously mentioned wine. When all of a sudden I hear a horrified gasp coming from the kitchen.  MAXINEEEEEEEE... OH LORD... MAXINEEEE COME QUICK .  Of course I responded  FOR CHRIST SAKE ANDREW WHAT????    COME HERE I NEED YOU TO CHECK SOMETHING .  So off I go to the kitchen  ruining my relaxing one on one action with Mr Moscato!  Anyway as I arrive in the kitchen my boyfriend is stood looking confused and dare I say it... hurt!  He directs me to the packaging and asks me how many slices are supposed to be contained in the glorious garlic goodness... 6... not 5... 6! I mean don t get me wrong I don t really care at this point because I have wine so it doesn t effect me in the slightest!   BUT WHO WILL HAVE THE EXTRA SLICE... it should be 3 each    Andrew I don t care I have wine you have it   To which my delightful yet slightly mad and hangry boyfriend replied in disgust...  You don t care about garlic bread   So basically here I am pretty drunk complaining about a missing slice of garlic bread not because I care but to save my relationship. Because apparently garlic bread is life!!!   I don t feel you owe me an apology but if you could send one to Andrew Stevenson I would appreciate it!  Off to finish the wine!

However they so rudely didn t eat all the goodies I bought. So I brought some home for pudding tonight but when I opened this packet of cookies they were more dough then üç™! Only a very small nibbleable halo was cooked and lovely and chewy. The rest is a big pile of sog! Now I m not objecting to turning these into cookie dough ice cream but nothing I could do would beat Ben and jerrys so I think I might just not bother. Please can I have some more cookies?? üòÅ üç™üç™üç™	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14639820_10153756706616307_1557563158354863403_n.jpg?oh=d2e38ec98229b1214bb692962221e6eb&oe=591E10C4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/14639820_10153756706616307_1557563158354863403_n.jpg?oh=e58efa1f9c2480900309423073e73468&oe=58E58B31	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153756706616307&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-28T20:52:20+0000	1477687940	2016-10-28 22:52:20	3	2	4	0	6	2	1	1	0	0	3	0	0	1	0	0	0

I m sure I used to be able to get these from your Kingston Park store but not anymore! I am of course talking about the McCoys Spicy Variety  Pack  3 flavours...  Mexican Chilli (The best flavour)  Thai Sweet Chicken (The 2nd best flavour) Sizzling King Prawn Flavour (the whatever flavour  not bothered about these)  I can find them on the Sainsburys website but have yet to look in store  I do prefer to shop at Tesco and have no issues with your stores however these crisps are pretty important to me and if Sainsburys sell them it maybe worth the extra few mile drive.....					2016-10-28T20:17:56+0000	1477685876	2016-10-28 22:17:56	2	4	2	0	6	4	1	3	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please explain to me how it is that I am being told by my local store that all the things I am looking to buy are no longer available  or out of stock. If there is so little demand  then how is it that items you do stock have always run out.  It is a no win situation.  If you stock items we all want and we buy them  then they run out.  If you stock items we want but nobody else does  then there is plenty of availability but no demand  so you discontinue them.  Maybe you would have more space in your store for things we want if you waited until closer to Christmas before stocking your shelves with chocolate Santa  mince pies and festive fare.  Wouldn t.t get that at Sainsburys.					2016-10-28T19:34:07+0000	1477683247	2016-10-28 21:34:07	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last week I complained about being sold out of date yoghurts that my daughter ate and that made her poorly. Tonight someone from the store in question has been to visit us about the matter. I was really upset with how you had handled this but tonight you have restored my full faith and got a customer for life. Sadly I couldn t speak to the manager who visited as I was too poorly but my husband did and what she did coming to visit us at home and travelling far  was totally above and beyond anything I expected. She even brought a gift for my daughter (that she s currently cuddling in bed now!). Thank you so much  you ve proved that you do care and that your customers do matter. I m truly touched and hugely impressed by how you resolved this and the action taken. Thank you Tesco!					2016-10-28T19:33:14+0000	1477683194	2016-10-28 21:33:14	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today my mother went in and was approached by Dan( staff member ) and asked how she was.... Unfortunately we had to break the news she had passed away on Tues. My mum was then presented with flowers and a Sympathy card. We are overwhelmed at the kindness and lovely words given to us. My Nana was 85 and has always shopped in the store so I m sure she would of been so happy to of received theses. Thank you so so much.

On Wednesday I received an email notifying me that I had been refunded for an item for not collecting. I did actually want the item but realised I forgot about it because I did not get an email confirming it was ready for collection. (I had ordered a fair amount of other things at the same time) I have spoken to customer services who have apologised but I m now expected to reorder which means paying double because it was half price when I originally ordered.  I m really not impressed after spending quite a fair bit of money on everything else I ordered from yourselves!					2016-10-28T18:01:43+0000	1477677703	2016-10-28 20:01:43	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Diverted my journey home thru Stone Cross in West Bromwich at 5.30pm tea-time  on my way back from work  to fill up with petrol & get some groceries from the shop at the Tesco Express there.  I did attempt to do exactly the same LAST night but there was a delivery van there (...brilliant timing!) & so it was coned off & shut. Have a guess what? 5.30pm Friday night rush-hour & there s yet ANOTHER delivery van there!!! (...more perfect timing!) & so it was coned off & shut yet AGAIN!! >.< This petrol station with shop has been my weekly regular for a long time - but just lately I m lucky to catch the bloody place OPEN on my way back from work at around 5.30 - it happened to me LAST week as well! >.< WHY can t you receive your deliveries at a quieter time in the day?? Say 10.30am  or just after lunch? OK Tesco - so you ve wasted my time TWICE this week  but you re not gonna waste it AGAIN! - I pass a Shell petrol station with grocery shop earlier on in my journey & there s a Jet station & shop a bit further past my home - so I will  from now on  be taking my wallet & my custom ELSEWHERE!!! #Boycotted!					2016-10-28T17:57:04+0000	1477677424	2016-10-28 19:57:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At the till he was asked for the ID as was his girlfriend who is only 17 and not attempting to purchase said bottle  now I understand that he might have been buying it for her! However would she have admitted at that moment to only being 17 AND more importantly show me a 17 year old that drinks red wine!! I preferred hooch  diamond white and castaway you know get proper hammered on alcohol with more sugar and E numbers than woolies pick n mix  a modicum of common sense would surly prevail at this point but no!!!  Upon returning to the store after his girlfriend getting a bus home he was again refused and flanked by 2 security guards he subsequently asked to speak to a manager. Now your Burnley store is a large store but apparently only has 1 manager on shift who took 10mins to grace him with his presence  I was on the phone during this conversation he was rather rude and maybe needs a refresher course on customer service and staff rotation as clearly one manager isn t enough poor man had had to leave his tea bless!!					2016-10-28T16:50:02+0000	1477673402	2016-10-28 18:50:02	0	11	0	0	11	11	3	8	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This offer is not on-line!!!  Phoned leatherhead and spoke to lovely scottish lady - none there either but she helpfully checked all other local stores to no avail!!!!! I asked if I could buy display and she said they should be able to sell to me and got me put through to Horsham - after holding on for ever while the customer services lady went to check - got told none in stock.  Asked to buy display got told no as it was a special offer and they couldn t sell it s while still on offer!!!!!!  So you have none in stock but still want to tempt people to buy an item you have no stock of and frustrate them hugely into the bargain - I don t get it!!!!!!

I have often gone out of my way to find a tesco for this deal as you are one of the few places that had an option for gluten intolerant and coeliac people. I went hungry this week  and spent 20 minutes on hold to customer services to complain before giving up. Any plans to reinstate the sushi or have another gluten free option?					2016-10-28T15:16:45+0000	1477667805	2016-10-28 17:16:45	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The other day I had a number of things to buy so was very keen to use my vouchers that you recently sent me where you got a decent discount if you spent ¬£50 or more in one shop. Unfortunately I hadn t put the voucher in my wallet as I had thought having left them at home. Once I explained the situation  Georgian who was helping me at the self scan till  consulted her colleague Paul Jamieson who quickly and without any question authorised the equivalent voucher amount to be taken off the total  trusting my word!  Every little helps! 					2016-10-28T14:46:59+0000	1477666019	2016-10-28 16:46:59	5	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I approached a member of staff who was doing a online order. I asked him where I could find a member of staff to help me to find something (the store has recently been moved around) he informed me that he didn t know and couldn t help me!  I wasn t asking him to personally help  I could see he was doing something but to completely brush me off is not good customer service. I have shopped online for years but today s visit has made my mind up to stop shopping with you! I m sure a company your size won t miss by ¬£100+ weekly food shop!					2016-10-28T14:39:43+0000	1477665583	2016-10-28 16:39:43	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Usually it s the rude staff/managers blocking the Isles and having their extremely personal but loud conversations that frustrates me. However  today it was getting home and opening Feta Cheese I had bought 30 mins before and  it being completely off! It was a light brown in colour and absolutely stunk....either the fridge was broken or it had not been stored properly...I would have returned it if I hadn t already thrown the receipt.

The staff at this store know my son has additional needs and every time we go here they offer customer service that can t be faulted. Today approx 1345 we went to the store (I forgot to get a receipt but it was very quiet so it wouldn t be hard to track down the staff member that excelled herself today) and the self service check out was card only we were paying cash.. My son love s to scan the shopping and the lady that served us today asked my son if he would like to scan the items. To your average customer with children additional needs or not this makes shopping fun for children and give ;s them a sense of achievement. The shop was quiet and the lady asked my son if he would like to scan the items which she didn t have to do and the lady knew my son wouldn t say yes please or thank you as he has select mutism (he will only talk to my immediate family). I did thank the lady for such a lovely gesture  I just wanted Head Office to know about the shining stars of Tesco Express Rowner Gosport as this isn t the 1st time I have contacted you about the staff of this store and the support they have given to us.					2016-10-28T13:19:05+0000	1477660745	2016-10-28 15:19:05	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They had carrots and Parsnips. so I chose 3 deformed parsnips and 2 three legged carrots. I put them in a veg/fruit see through bag because they didn t have any dedicated bags for them and when I had finished my shopping went to the checkout. The checkout assistant took them out of the bag and weighed the parsnips at full price and then the carrots. so I said  no they are scary veg.  what?  so I repeated it. she looked at me in that  should I call Security  way. So I quickly explained that Tesco was selling what they called scary veg at 30p per 5 items and it said so on the stand. She knew nothing about it and called a supervisor who also knew nothing about it. They eventually let me have my 5 items for 30p but it made me feel really uncomfortable. Even my husband said to just leave it  it wasnt worth the hassle. You would think that Tesco would tell their staff what they were doing. I m just surprised kids haven t been arrested for eating the free fruit on offer on the same stand.					2016-10-28T12:19:48+0000	1477657188	2016-10-28 14:19:48	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were shopping for birthday things as he is 8 tomorrow and the checkout lady made a fuss of his birthday  she then asked him about his thick lip which Oscar( my son) told her he d bite it whilst it was numb from a visit to the dentist yesterday. Upon this she asked the supervisor if they could do something for Oscar!!! So off Oscar went with the supervisor to pick a toy!!! I can not explain how grateful we and Oscar were!!! What fantastic service and how heartwarming it made me feel I actually could of cried. People are too quick to complain or take to social media when things go wrong or are not quite right but no one speaks out when good things are done. This was beyond first class service. Thank you so much you ve made one little boys day and have made my day too. Apolggise if i have got your names complety wrong. Again thank you so much xxxxx					2016-10-28T12:07:15+0000	1477656435	2016-10-28 14:07:15	70	15	72	9	96	15	9	6	15	0	70	2	0	0	0	0	0

So  every one of these green bags has ONE item in it  ONE!! ONE small pot of olives  ONE pack of ham  ONE pack of french beans and so on. Does the St. Neots branch really think it necessary to use SO MANY BAGS when using your delivery service?? I mean  it s not like this is the first time  it s every week!   On the other hand  the white bag has so many items in it  that the bag handles failed whilst I was carrying it through into the house... I could honestly gain some serious muscle with this one bag alone!  Why use so many bags is my burning question? I had 32 bags with my shopping today (before anyone mentions the fact that I can have it delivered without bags  I m aware of this however I would prefer not to have people come into the house  and the green crates are way too heavy to carry when full... it s an option available to consumers and it s my option to choose the option!)  I managed to very easily (and sensibly I might add; meat with meat  fresh produce with fresh produce etc. etc.)  get my shopping into just 14 bags... THAT S 18 BAGS MORE THAN NEEDED!!!  So Tesco  I guess you would at this stage think of offering a money off voucher or something along those lines as a way of saying  we re sorry . I m not interested in money off my next shop  this is what I want you to do...   For every bag over that you delivered to me today (that s 18 extra bags remember)  I would like you to donate ¬£5.00 to a local charity in St. Neots  Cambridgeshire along with an extra ¬£5.00 for the split handle bag (it was very inconvenient  food rolling around the floor  trying to desperately escape my grasp... I ve seen that food movie!! üò±) That s a donation of ¬£95.00... (you could always round up to a ¬£100.00 if your feeling generous! üòâüòâ).  Please let me know which charity you have chosen  I m sure they will be delighted with the gesture from you. After all  every little helps right!  Many thanks and look forward to hearing from you.

Brought a frozen bike for my little girl at the end of September for click and collect at my local store in Preston paignton. Not heard a thing (normally notifications via email) so decided to track and it s ready. Went there and they had them all in 2 weeks ago and almost all were sent back due to non collection. The shop assistant phoned and you re out of stock and no idea when you ll get more. Can you please explain why this has happened and let me know when I can get one as it s a Christmas present					2016-10-28T11:00:16+0000	1477652416	2016-10-28 13:00:16	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I was in the wine aisle looking at products one of your employees bumped into me with a shopping delivery cart and didn t acknowledge me at all. I moved along out the way of him and then had to physically jump back out of the way as he nearly did it again. I decided to curtail my shopping and went to pay at a self service checkout. The till didn t acknowledge my clubcard so I went to the customer service desk where I was completely ignored for over seven minutes at which point I decided to leave the store.					2016-10-28T10:50:53+0000	1477651853	2016-10-28 12:50:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Noticed some lovely new products in my local store on Tuesday  lovely lasagne  pizza etc  but alas all gluten and wheat free but milk galore. Why is this? You have started selling white sauce  and you already sell dairy free cheese  therefore you must be able to assemble a lasagne or pizza that is dairy free along with wheat and gluten. I will await your reply whilst having more celery sticks as they are definitely dairy free					2016-10-28T10:19:29+0000	1477649969	2016-10-28 12:19:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Currently people can buy directly from the FARM and raw milk is not dangerous as many people like to think it has stringent production and regular visits from the authorities to make sure standards of hygiene and production are kept high and to the standard required.  Raw milk is a superior product to pasteurised and in fact a health product  but pasteurisations damages the protein in milk and actually makes it a non health product.					2016-10-28T09:44:59+0000	1477647899	2016-10-28 11:44:59	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just noticed its out of date by 2 days... Ironically  in the same week  I overheard a lady in the same store complaining to a member of staff that some Mr Kipling cakes were also out of date.  Whilst a smoothie is unlikely to cause harm  what if that was a meat or dairy product?

The store our shopping is picked at all week have been showing that satsumas are no longer sold by Tesco and there was no variety of mince pies available  also seasonal cookies not available but walk into the store and all these products are available on the shelf. Also this morning satsumas are available again and over 10 varieties of mince pies all online but no good when shopping is delivered today. I have asked the question in store and have also emailed the general email address and none can answer the question. This gets more and more frustrating every week. Look forward to your response and explanation to this.					2016-10-28T07:27:41+0000	1477639661	2016-10-28 09:27:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I visited my local store in Whiteley with my daughter who was celebrating her 15th birthday. We came to pick up a cake for her. She was wearing a birthday badge and when we arrived in store we were greeted by the most wonderful man Ola.  He wished her happy birthday and sang to her then later on as we were leaving to go home he did something truly amazing. He gave her a card and some chocolates and spoke to her about her dreams for the future and that she can achieve anything she sets her mind too if her heart desires. Now Ola didn t know that my daughter has additional needs and he didn t know that she s been struggling with life recently and what decisions to make for the future. But after her chat with your wonderful member of staff she told me that she felt better about her future and she smiled and laughed the rest of the day. A simple act of pure kindness has done so much and I don t know how I can thank this guy enough for what he did today. He is truly one of life s special gems and he needs to be recognised for this. Please give him a big pat on the back Tesco he so deserves it.  Signed One very happy Mummy :) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è					2016-10-28T07:04:34+0000	1477638274	2016-10-28 09:04:34	3203	324	3726	208	4258	321	284	37	364	0	3173	506	8	3	0	0	0

Have there been any other reported instances of this  as this has been a regular occurrence for me.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14600943_10154197579473681_4365228340019996176_n.jpg?oh=3e46457f609f321b01bdf4d42826abeb&oe=58F02A7A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14600943_10154197579473681_4365228340019996176_n.jpg?oh=803340cf357ef1eb7308d0dce1b17c77&oe=58E7600E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154197579473681&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-28T06:35:43+0000	1477636543	2016-10-28 08:35:43	2	8	2	0	10	7	4	3	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Around 7am me and my 8 year old son popped into the store for a few bits and pieces  my son had lost his tooth the day before and the Tooth Fairy had left him 50p. He was clutching his money in his hand and we were down the toy isle whilst my son was choosing a Lego Mini Figure to spend his money on. Whilst choosing he dropped his 50p and it rolled under the shelving unit  he became quite upset and so we were scrabbling around trying to find it.  A lovely female member of staff (I m so sorry  I didn t catch her name but thank you to her too) asked if she could help and when I explained she said she d see if she could find a cleaner to help us.  She returned a few minutes later with a friendly chap and he had a rummage around under the shelving unit with his angled broom to try and find it for my son. He couldn t locate it but could see my son was upset  he reached into his own pocket and explained that as my son had lost it and it was a special coin that he couldn t find he d replace it for him and handed my son a pound coin. I admit  I was welling up at this point.  This man s name was Dean and he restored my faith in human kind today. It may seem like such a small gesture but he showed kindness and understanding to my son and it meant the world to me.  I shook Dean s hand and thanked him but I wanted to tell you what a valued and kind member of staff you have working for you.   Please  PLEASE thank Dean again for me. He s put a smile on my son s face  and mine.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14639711_10154710198101979_1551745995449273883_n.jpg?oh=75a0bc9a59c9fc3ee81523e92a81c852&oe=5918240B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14639711_10154710198101979_1551745995449273883_n.jpg?oh=f037fb92f1d243d3b0f3efef39d13d5e&oe=58D99806	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154710198101979&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-28T06:34:50+0000	1477636490	2016-10-28 08:34:50	30	7	32	2	41	6	4	2	5	0	30	2	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday our shopping was due to arrive between 8 and 9. I book it for this time as the baby is in bed but as he is a terrible sleeper and my day usually begins at 4am I am normally in bed no later than 9. If you are a parent  especially one with a poor sleeper  you will understand how precious time and sleep are. Yesterday you text to say our shopping would be late. We needed the shopping yes  but I had just survived 3 nights on the trot with absolutely no sleep.  I m not really complaining that you were late  stuff happens  problems are unavoidable. But in that moment I just wanted to tell you not to come.  I had no choice however as despite the fact you could contact me I had no way of responding to your texts.  Eventually the shopping arrived at 9.50.  My feedback would be this: if you can t make the time I ve booked please let me cancel. If this was a day time slot we may not have been in if you were late. I d rather be given the choice given I have paid for a delivery time.					2016-10-28T05:52:38+0000	1477633958	2016-10-28 07:52:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was supposed to receive my delivery between 4-5pm today. When it didn t arrive  I called at 5pm and after speaking to a lovely customer services rep  being put on hold and then being called back I was informed that the driver who was supposed to deliver my order didn t come into work today and it had been put on another van  but they didn t know which one or what time it would arrive. At 7.45pm I was pretty fed up  I spoke to another lovely customer services rep and was on hold for about 15 minutes while she tried to sort it out for me. She said she had spoken to four different people in the store and nobody could give her any answers and I was told to call back at nine so that we could take this further (her words). I called again at 9pm and after waiting 10 minutes for someone to pick up (a third friendly customer services rep) I was told that I would be called back within 20 minutes so that I didn t have to stay on hold and listen to your horrible hold music (his words not mine)  but I haven t been called back. I don t know about you guys  but I can t just relax thinking that my delivery with tomorrow s dinner  that I need to put in the slow cooker in the morning before my little boy wakes up  I had plans for this evening  but I just seem to be sitting here aimlessly waiting for a delivery that I think won t turn up before hell freezes over. I ll call back at 10pm if this friendly sounding  but not very efficient  as he hasn t called back  customer services rep will call me with an answer.					2016-10-27T20:42:56+0000	1477600976	2016-10-27 22:42:56	0	20	0	0	20	20	5	15	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was probably only 5 minutes  but it was the worst experience of my life. The staff in store were awesome. I can not say thank you enough. They were so efficient in trying to find him  and looking after my daughter and her friend whilst I freaked out. They then were so caring about me when I found him  and was a gibbering wreck. Top job everyone!! Thank you thank you thank you!! X					2016-10-27T19:20:54+0000	1477596054	2016-10-27 21:20:54	7	5	7	0	12	5	4	1	1	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Two members of staff then checked the stock room   and advised that this particular store are no longer stocking them  but was told I could make a request at customer services to try and get them back in. I spoke to customer services who located the manager  who proceeded to tell me that this store will no longer be stocking the requested brand of crisps as they are not making enough money on this particular brand.  Clearly it all comes down to profits instead of catering for every individuals needs  this is complete discrimination. This is not the first time I have contacted Tescos to complain or make a request for gluten free foods to be available. Sadly Tescos you have lost a customer after 20+ years of shopping with you  and I will be making the fact profits come before needs to all the gluten free /coeliac groups available.					2016-10-27T19:03:42+0000	1477595022	2016-10-27 21:03:42	9	4	16	1	21	3	1	2	0	0	9	0	0	0	0	7	0

He saw that we were all waiting for him and rather than move the van back a little so we could get past  he went to the house and delivered all the food  put the boxes back etc. Meaning we were sat for a good 10 minutes with a screaming baby. Not to mention the inconvenience to the other people in the hold up.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14523225_10100395102280899_7553201110492720744_n.jpg?oh=a5eb596ff07757639d49d691d1d87cc1&oe=591D4B2F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14523225_10100395102280899_7553201110492720744_n.jpg?oh=9c6edf3112016c71d5af5e45f5ad71fa&oe=58EECF22	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100395102280899&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-27T19:02:53+0000	1477594973	2016-10-27 21:02:53	2	9	4	0	13	9	4	5	7	0	2	0	0	0	1	1	0

Whilst in the clothing area I asked a member of staff where the flowers were and before I could finish my sentence an older gentleman with grey hair snapped at me saying  the clothes are over there! . I then replied by saying that I know where the clothes are but I m after flowers to which replied  I don t work in that section .  At this point I decided to leave it and just get the jeans and a few other bits I had already picked up. I went to the checkouts where an older lady was writing something in a pad. I stood there waiting for her to acknowledge me. The only time I got any form of communication was when she looked up and pointed at the screen showing the price. The lady being served after me was a tesco employee as she was wearing the uniform and got a lovely warm hello off the same checkout lady who ignored me. I left the store feeling so angry about the experience and to top it off the lady didn t take the tag off my jeans so I now can t wear them for an event I am going to tonight as I have only just realised it is still on. I am hoping I can go to my local store to get it taken off tomorrow or I will have to go all the way back over to Coventry and no doubt experience the same shocking customer service. I shop with Tesco all the time and have never experienced such shocking service. I have attached the jeans and receipt in question.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14563435_10157913052185122_433305014505952259_n.jpg?oh=79591e87cd96bc2a795852e6f3702923&oe=58E09C47	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14563435_10157913052185122_433305014505952259_n.jpg?oh=d8b262c776b29e508d8c4a4935f8df76&oe=58D9EB3B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157913052185122&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-27T17:30:45+0000	1477589445	2016-10-27 19:30:45	13	3	14	0	17	2	2	0	1	0	13	0	0	0	0	1	0

I haven t had a delivery for over a month now as my daughter has left for uni and I m currently flying solo and steadily getting used to it.  He remembered this from my last delivery and asked me how I m doing.  I ve had a particularly difficult day today (approaching anniversaries connected with the loss of my husband) and he spoke to me like he cared.  He made a difference to my day today and i just want him to know he is doing a good job.  I hope all your drivers remember that  even at my age (43) they might be the only person who has spoken to their customers on that day .  You don t have to be elderly to appreciate a friendly face so please pass on my thanks and appreciation to him for me.  Thank you.					2016-10-27T17:18:41+0000	1477588721	2016-10-27 19:18:41	12	4	12	0	16	4	2	2	1	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

All information said it was being delivered today (between 1.30pm and 3.30pm) then I received an email saying it was coming tomorrow.  I phoned you to ask which it was to be told it would be today.  Now there s a problem with delivery.  Nobody thought it important to contact me and tell me anything until I contacted them.  The delivery company said to take it up with you.  Tesco say to take it up with the delivery company.  Apparently neither has managers to escalate problems to.  I now don t want the order as it s been an absolute farce  but apparently it can t just be cancelled.

Absolutely ridiculous no customer loyalty what so ever  will not be recommending to anyone in fact will be doing my best to discourage custom!					2016-10-27T15:12:30+0000	1477581150	2016-10-27 17:12:30	1	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Now as all retailers charge 5p for a carrier bag  or 10p for a bag for life  I opted for the posh version  you know the heavy duty dark blue Tesco bag  made of sterner stuff than polythene. My bag however has broken  the handle has snapped  so imagine my surprise when I went to customer services only to be told  we don t replace them  by you store representative! So I buy a bag  more expensive than the bag for life (which you can swap on a whim)  only for it to be faulty  then on returning it  be told it won t be replaced??!!  Poor quality bag  poor quality customer service  poor attitude by the store rep.  Please see pictures attached.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14639832_10154537129007368_5851454423813585830_n.jpg?oh=a4a9c71a730a14b154dbe0ee7f944591&oe=58E2EE30	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14639832_10154537129007368_5851454423813585830_n.jpg?oh=bb7ba8c5bc110f8dec4ecbfd60d59bdc&oe=58ED013D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154537129007368&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-27T15:05:49+0000	1477580749	2016-10-27 17:05:49	5	18	9	0	27	18	5	13	9	0	5	0	1	2	1	0	0

I asked to hear from you expecting to hear where the plastic had come from  how it came to be in my strudel  and what had been done about it. I received a response that starts with  I can appreciate how concerning this may have been for you   well frankly I m not at all sure you do appreciate that at all  since my 2 year old niece was with me for dinner that Sunday and had a piece of strudel too...I suppose I should be grateful that it was me that bit down on it and the only outcome was that no one wanted to eat any more and it all went in the bin  rather than her choking on it and a potentially awful conversation with my sister. The letter goes on to say that there are procedures in place to prevent this sort of thing  and that the manufacturer s will look into these to try and prevent it happening to anyone else. I still have no idea what exactly it was that I found myself chowing down on  nor how it came to be there. It ends with  I hope this may help  well given that it doesn t actually tell me anything at all  no  it doesn t help!					2016-10-27T14:53:26+0000	1477580006	2016-10-27 16:53:26	0	8	1	0	9	8	4	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Used Scan and Shop because the queues at the checkouts were horrendous.  Several items we needed such as milk and butter in the quantities we wanted were not available so we couldn t complete our shop satisfactorily.  When we went to pay for our shopping an assistant came running over and started rifling through our shopping in front of other customers.  We had carefully placed items in the trolley so as not to squash the tomatoes or crisps which obviously didn t occur to the assistant.  We abandoned our shopping and left the store absolutely disgusted.  Talk about defamation of character.					2016-10-27T14:46:52+0000	1477579612	2016-10-27 16:46:52	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown before I d even finished the fruit and veg so you can imagine how stressed I was by the time my trolley was full. By this point the kids were seeing if they could throw sweets 20 feet down the aisle into the trolley without me noticing.  Practically crying  I loaded my shopping onto the checkout whilst trying to ignore the tuts from elderly  child-free or smug working parents.  At this point an alien abduction would ve been quite welcome however instead of an alien abduction we got an Abbie. Abbie was amazing. She distracted the kids from my Christmas bits hiding amongst the broccoli and let them help her scan the rest  meaning they actually stopped pestering for sugar filled treats and behaved in a lovely  childlike manner. They were so excited and happy to have been helpful and I felt like I d gone deaf. It was heaven.  So  thank you Abbie for being amazing and for not judging me on what felt like the most stressful experience of my life.   Every little certainly does help. A lot.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14595652_10153970861226179_5667050997446862720_n.jpg?oh=e7871195fa8db45a9b1b406b66254469&oe=58EA645F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14595652_10153970861226179_5667050997446862720_n.jpg?oh=51ce4e9af3137c3ff886062251527707&oe=58EA2752	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153970861226179&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-27T13:15:45+0000	1477574145	2016-10-27 15:15:45	368	41	420	42	503	41	39	2	79	0	367	51	1	0	0	0	0

She is gradually becoming more tolerant of dairy products (as a baby she could not have soya either but now can and can tolerate dairy products in cooked form but not in  pure  form and definitely not in  regular  chocolate.) While it may seem a small thing  to many - for Emilia to be able to receive a selection box with treats in which she can eat at Christmas when other children receive one in her school or at Rainbows will be a big deal for her because she will feel the same as other children and for children with food allergies and intolerances that is a big deal! Well Done Tesco and thank you!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14573044_10153946853875686_5302554714617694447_n.jpg?oh=a16d06c8d5380f2fcdc2f472d2bbe72f&oe=58ED20AA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14573044_10153946853875686_5302554714617694447_n.jpg?oh=7c68dd5bbbf72629cee309a5afe819a5&oe=58DF1BA7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153946853875686&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-27T13:06:24+0000	1477573584	2016-10-27 15:06:24	4	0	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I paid Octoberss early as I was going on holiday and when I returned home I made another payment   so October had 2 payments. When I rang to clarify this I was told the October s payment was a few days late and the early payment was classed as an early payment. I have been charged for making the payment early. How crazy is this? To charge a good customer for over paying. I will not be using the card again  or any of your banking services. I will use a bank in future with real banking background.					2016-10-27T12:45:44+0000	1477572344	2016-10-27 14:45:44	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased an iPad 2 yrs ago - the Home button broke so I took it back and said that I would have expected a more robust manufacture of a key component and that 2yrs is not Fit and Proper.  I was advised by the young man  in a very aggressive tone  that I was using the incorrect terminology and that when purchased the item was Fit for Purpose.  He would advise what he needed to help me further.  Did I have till receipt: no but I have the Interest Free Credit Agreement.  Thats no good - Did I have proof of purchase like bank statement - well yes.  Could he have the last 4 digits of the DD.  No I didnt have it with me - to this he said - again aggressively - but you told me you did.  No I didnt say with me didnt think I would need all that.  Then he said he would need a full written Repair Report from Apple.  I had already explained that I had been through to Apple Help and their advice was that they do not repair iPads merely recycle but would exchange mine for a like for like at a cost of ¬£180.  I reminded the young man of this and he said that in order for him to help he had to have a repair report from Apple.  So the upshot of this story is that where Apple and TESCO are concerned you dont really have any recourse for complaint.  TESCO have now lost one loyal customer - disgusted					2016-10-27T11:36:47+0000	1477568207	2016-10-27 13:36:47	0	12	0	0	12	12	3	9	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You will be pleased to know (or not) that I have now completed a study and numeric survey of Tesco carnations. Tescos advised that the ¬£4 packs were approx 12 centimetres longer than the ¬£2 packs which is about 4.72  WRONG. Guys that s so wrong comparing the packs I bought today. I ve evidenced same with attached photographs with tape. In fact the ¬£4 pack has a couple of stems which are longer by a ruler width which is slightly over 1 . And we all know how important an inch is - well Tescos inch is nearer 5 . Now one could say in evidence that maybe there are more flowers/buds on the ¬£4 pack per stem. No - I counted them - each stem has an average of 4 or 5 per stem. Yes - I know I m over the top. Now the COST ISSUE. Please note that 2 weeks ago my ¬£2 packs cost ¬£2 - today they ve gone up to ¬£2.50 which Tesco forgot to advise in their note. But hey hoe - no matter. IT S STILL CHEAPER TO BUY 2 X ¬£2.50s and here s the stats. ¬£4.00 pack had today 16 stems = .25p per stem. ¬£4.00 pack had 62 blooms/buds = 0.064p per bud ¬£2.50 pack had today 11 stems = .23p per stem. ¬£2.50 pack had 47 blooms/buds = 0.047p per bud Plus you get 2 x flower fresh liquids if you buy 2 packs. Also please note that 4 buds/flowers were bent/broken in the ¬£4 pack. I can see that larger packs are more difficult to transport - so really the smaller ¬£2.50 is far better buy.  And on a final note - I have studied Sainburies  Asda  Lidl & Aldi carnations and Tescos carnations are the best in my opinion. Just be careful out there folk.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q86/s130x130/14900391_908830642583449_3411662367955692079_n.jpg?oh=3cc7dfa839b35efa1bfbe6f28b90981e&oe=58EB9D4F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14900391_908830642583449_3411662367955692079_n.jpg?oh=95f15d04fc1380e7ee1c1a229dda88a7&oe=58D90190	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=908830642583449&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-27T11:03:33+0000	1477566213	2016-10-27 13:03:33	0	5	0	0	5	5	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So this is what I did  I then travelled the next say to hindley store which is a 30 minute drive away to be told there was none in stock Even though it was showing one. The staff were pretty rude  they weren t helpful to me whatsoever after me and my little girl had just travelled all this way under false pretences.not happy with your service at all and went elsewhere instead that could be bothered with their customer service skills!					2016-10-27T10:02:51+0000	1477562571	2016-10-27 12:02:51	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My mum is a regular user of your Callington store and often has my little brother  who is 12  with her.  She has mentioned to me that the store intends to employ parking attendants to patrol the car park. Part of the rules they will enforce is that in order to use the parent and child parking area she will have to be issued with a  ticket or badge  to be displayed when parked in a bay - it s a fantastic idea as these are commonly used by people without children and can only be used until the children are 12 years old.  Usually this would be perfectly acceptable  however my brother is autistic. He quite often forgets where he is and the kind of safety advice that most of us follow without a second thought - such as not running into the road without looking.  Not to mention should a melt-down happen. He will either walk or run away  sometimes with his eyes closed.  As he is fully mobile  he isn t entitled to a disabled parking badge.  As you can imagine  the parent and child parking area is a great help to my mum and brother  especially as 99% of the time she is on her own with him.   I was wondering whether you knew if there was a way we could get a permit for my brother despite the age-related rules  or whether this will be a blanket age limit with no exceptions?   Thank you for your time :)					2016-10-27T09:39:48+0000	1477561188	2016-10-27 11:39:48	1	6	1	0	7	6	3	3	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was hugely disappointed to see the results coming up as  milk alternatives .   Firstly I saw Lacto free and goats milk came up in the list.  This is personally annoying but I can see that maybe they are an alternative to normal cows milk if not a true milk alternative.   However when limiting the results to Dairy Free Milk alternatives lacto free  and goats milk still come up.  Dairy free is usually interchangeable with Milk Free - in fact many of your own brand products use both of these terms. Lacto free is not ever suitable for people with a cows milk allergy and 9/10 people with a cows milk allergy are also sensitive to goats milk so it is unacceptable for these products to come up in this category in my view; especially as there is a different subcategory for lactose free and goats milk.  Under Butter  Spreads and Margarine you only have 1 item which is again a lacto free product.  This is despite you stocking at least 3 dairy free spreads and 2 dairy free baking fats: Vitalite  Pure  Flora dairy free  Stock foil baking block and Tesco baking fat.  I couldn t find any of the Tesco or Violife cheese either and the only cheese showing is a low cholesterol one  There was another sections labelled Condensed  evaporated  dried milk and cream which contains a UHT cows milk product and there is no way to find the cream alternatives you do stock like Alpro and Oatly.  And speaking of Oatly I was really pleased to see you are extending your Oatly range to include custard and creme fraiche but these are not showing from this search page and neither is the foamable Oatly milk  I could go on it feels like forever...  You have 2 sections for dairy free yogurt  one of which has goats milk in the title.  Neither of them contain any goats milk yogurt which I am sure you must stock and neither of them show any of the many soya yogurts you stock both Alpro and own brand.  And this is just obvious errors from one advertised link.  Never mind things that could be improved like including ordinary (not expensive free-from) products that happen to be dairy free in your free from listings.  Or considering gaps in your product range for people with different allergies  especially when discontinuing products.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14570475_10157731763345037_2446024255203915001_n.jpg?oh=551d810a87f07c10b665ef77d7c0e8c8&oe=5920AA84	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14570475_10157731763345037_2446024255203915001_n.jpg?oh=f7a2b5a143763997d08ec819c341f16f&oe=58DEFF62	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157731763345037&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-27T08:23:28+0000	1477556608	2016-10-27 10:23:28	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He gave over a ¬£20 note which the woman behind the till typed in ¬£10 which I m partner was unaware of. He gave over his ¬£20 to be given back come change he said that he gave over 20 and the lady said well I typed in¬£10.  It dosent matter that u typed In ¬£10 what matters is that  ¬£20 was given over and u made a mistake. After the manager or whatever came down to check whatever that had to be done and was no help what so ever to be told that they will have to do a more you check at the end. So I do hope to get a phone call tomorrow giving back our correct money. This is an issues that happens quite often from people I know in my Ryde store just to diddle people of out money. I think they should have a better security system on the tills of people who this thing is monitored and stops happening.					2016-10-26T22:57:13+0000	1477522633	2016-10-27 00:57:13	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were only alerted to it when our 4 year old started to gag and then vomit whilst crying his eyes out. To say we are fuming is a understatement! Tesco have poisoned our children. I complained in store to initially be offered some more to replace them ! Seriously I doubt my kids will ever want to eat them again.

(428-0242)  Now when I go to look at it online it comes up with only the beechwood hall and no accessories. Having just spoken to Tesco direct they were unable to help. Is this just a mistake in the catalogue or will you be doing the gift set??

They where cooked however when they are bagged up and left on the hot shelfs so they can be picked up quickly and easily buy customers they sweat in the bag the the breadcrum coating was just a soggy mess. Could I surge at that they are put in the cardboard boxes if they are to be pre packed so they do not sweat. It isn t the 1st time this has happened but I ve never felt the need to complain about them until today as they where very soggy Infact the breadcrumbs where falling off in chunks. If someone could reply that would be great. Please keep up the good work tesco.					2016-10-26T15:16:14+0000	1477494974	2016-10-26 17:16:14	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I was bagging my purchased items  your employee came to me and said: did you pay for the bag? It s 5p .  I answered that I indeed paid for the bag and asked her twice to check my receipt and she replied: it s ok. It s ok.    I regret but this is not ok. You do not insinuate that your customer is a thief in front of everyone and then say it s ok. She should have apologised.  I would like to know whether this is the Tesco policy of etiquette and customer service to trust customers with self-checkout and then call them thief?   I would like this matter to be addressed and I expect and answer and formal apologies.

I bought a good boy tugs toy from your Cirencester store today and within 5 mins the perimeters had been breached and the toy was no more.

We popped in for a coffee in the coffee shop but more importantly to feed my baby. The  coffee shop was closed. Gareth was standing with some other members of staff and hearing the baby crying asked if I would like to use his office to feed her.  Excellent customer service which has made my afternoon much less stressful. Now we just need to find a coffee. Thank you Gareth.					2016-10-26T13:02:37+0000	1477486957	2016-10-26 15:02:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Launceston is an ever expanding town that needs this service available in all locations possible for those who are elderly  disabled and/or have children. I personally have two young children(1&3)  my nearest shop is tesco at half a mile away. The nearest place I can top up my electric key is in town which is over a mile. I do not drive and it is an incredibly long walk for my eldest just to get electric. I also know that the estate I live on is densely populated with families and elderly people and the street I live on has more than one disabled occupant alone. Launceston Tesco is the first supermarket I have come across that does not offer this service. Why?					2016-10-26T11:48:06+0000	1477482486	2016-10-26 13:48:06	19	30	19	5	54	30	19	11	37	0	19	0	0	0	0	0	0

You need to get a grip on reality  The workers here already are not going to disappear overnight and if you paid better wages you may just attract local people to apply for jobs.

Grocery delivery due between 9 and 10PM and still not here at 10.25PM with no contact from Tesco or the driver. Rang Tesco to be told my delivery had been returned back to the depot & I wouldn t be getting it tonight. My husband and I waited up for this delivery expecting it to be slightly delayed but my husband needed to get bed as he is at work at 5AM in the morning. I also had to ring twice as the first time I was put through to the wrong person then disconnected. I use Tesco delivery every time & never had a problem before but I WILL NOT be using this service again. #Tesco					2016-10-25T21:38:43+0000	1477431523	2016-10-25 23:38:43	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For massively increasing your dairy free alternatives at your Bourne Lincolnshire store! I almost jumped with delight when I spotted the fridge section today. As somebody whom is allergic to dairy  this made my week! Especially seeing as the local Sainsbury s are very disinterested in the need for these products. Please now stock the vegan quorn products :) I Love your veggie stuff  however most of it includes milk.  But big thank you and well done for what you ve done so far.

Luckily this was found in mine and not the piece I gave my 18mth old son. I was quite disappointed due to me being a  vegan  this is one of your vegan range items that I enjoy.

I visited to kiosk last night at 21:56 to be told it was closed. I then asked what time it closed and the ever so unpleasant cashier said 22:00. I started to walk off and then realised it wasn t yet 22:00 so asked why it was shut to be told that she had closed her till so couldn t serve me.   Excellent customer service  and particularly lovely as I was just nipping in for one of my 81 year old Nan s (who cannot get out on her own) small pleasures in life.

Have two screaming two year olds who are hungry. ordered my shopping  online to be delivered today between 4 and 5. Was unable to get it delivered any earlier. 10 past 5 and still wasn t here . (Still isn t here) called Tesco and was told that they had a system error   all the morning deliveries got cancelled and now they are trying to get the afternoon ones out   but are late and are trying to catch up. So why wasn t I contacted about this ? If They knew they were going to be late I would have gone to Asda and got something for our dinner earlier . My other half has now had to drive to Asda to get something for our dinner  Which we had planned to have at 5.30 latest. Resulting in happy 2 year olds. But here I am with two screaming children whilst daddy s had to go out and get something for them to eat and milk incase it s not here by bedtime.					2016-10-25T16:51:51+0000	1477414311	2016-10-25 18:51:51	1	10	3	0	13	10	4	6	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0

The flavour very much needs reworking.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14606433_1747777135485424_2389341311022178178_n.jpg?oh=6c0b13362531ef21aa6f3ba259807352&oe=5921A98C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14606433_1747777135485424_2389341311022178178_n.jpg?oh=838c0c51d057f191b66cd84d33c45b00&oe=58DF7AE7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1747777135485424&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-25T15:12:49+0000	1477408369	2016-10-25 17:12:49	4	11	5	0	16	4	3	1	4	0	3	0	0	1	0	0	0

When I arrived at your baby feeding/changing room I was disgusted. I didn t want to change him let alone feed him! The toilet was dirty  the floor was wet  there were used baby wipes and blue paper scattered around  the bins were overflowing and I refuse to sit in a chair which is cramped between a dirty toilet  overflowing nappy bins and a dirty changing mat to feed my baby. This needs sorting out as it s unacceptable and not fit for purpose. I left with a dirty and hungry baby. Whilst I m aware that I can  and more than willing to feed publicly my son is at a very distractable age which makes it very difficult. Not happy.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14721542_10154671290527888_4390393558433125026_n.jpg?oh=67bbf4dab5bd6ee98c70fab4c6018800&oe=58DD612B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14721542_10154671290527888_4390393558433125026_n.jpg?oh=2a59811bc4a6f06f42688b71d4c9c8c9&oe=59204726	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154671290527888&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-25T15:10:44+0000	1477408244	2016-10-25 17:10:44	1	6	2	0	8	5	5	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

I usually use your delivery service but today decided to visit your Mansfield store in person. On arriving there with my 3 children I was unable to find a trolley with 2 upright seats for my youngest children  I went in store to the customer service desk and asked for the trolley I needed to be told by your  trolley guy  that  there was 1 but a lady used it and the wheel fell off with her children in it and they almost fell out  this member of your staff laughed about that like it was funny ! I cannot believe that a store the size of a football pitch has (sorry had) a single trolley with 2 seats. As there was things I urgently needed I had no choice but to squash both my children in a disabled trolley which had the turning circle of the titanic and a mind of its own. I couldn t do my weekly shop as the trolley space was the size of a small barbie basket ! I had to apologise to several people for almost running them down. Why on this earth do you not provide trolleys with 2 seats? What about people with children close in age such as mine or people who have twins ? I m disgusted in your service and your staff today were of no help at all not to mention the man who laughed. Shopping with children isn t an enjoyable experience at the best of times but you made it a million times worse by not providing the correct equipment I needed. I strongly suggest you provide ALL your stores with double trolleys as I m sure I m not the only parent who has struggled. I will await your reply to this post  King regards  A very angry Linzi Bayliss	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14716077_10154569850163211_10032772233879366_n.jpg?oh=7df82cdff80b514bde748074fb732dd0&oe=58D9D0C6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14716077_10154569850163211_10032772233879366_n.jpg?oh=67172567620eb01b6c5dfb690cd251f9&oe=58E24639	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154569850163211&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-25T15:10:42+0000	1477408242	2016-10-25 17:10:42	33	56	38	8	102	54	16	38	13	0	33	0	0	1	0	4	0

We continually buy the 1.5kg every day value 3 way cook chips for our grandchildren and family when they come to eat. Now baring in mind that the kids come round to eat at least twice a week  with their favourite food being sausage  chips and beans  we tend to get through a bag a week.  Now we seem to have noticed a problem with said chips. As time has gone by  the quality of chip within the bag has seemed to reduce. Now you probably wonder where I m going with this  the problem being that we are throwing at least 0.25kg of the bag away in waste. This doesn t seem a lot  but for every 6 bags we buy a month  we are wasting a whole bag in chips that are inedible or too small to cook. This might not seem like a lot to you  but for two people on state pension it certainly adds up over the course of the year.  Now we are not going to be petty about this  we don t expect any backdated payment  refund or anything across those lines. What we do expect  is the promise of a better quality product  regardless of price  for which we can give to our family.  We will await your response going forward with this  as we don t want to lose a staple item on our weekly shopping list and want to please our grandkids all the more.  Thank you  Vee.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14671250_10157779289440389_8094646963598793589_n.jpg?oh=bb1e630b36d5d62431246f59662870ba&oe=58E16C9E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14671250_10157779289440389_8094646963598793589_n.jpg?oh=71deb0e3d156a859c9d96c9efcfd3f36&oe=58D70B93	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157779289440389&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-25T13:55:49+0000	1477403749	2016-10-25 15:55:49	0	5	0	0	5	3	2	1	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today my daughter and I visited to do a bit of quick shopping for dinner  my daughter was dancing around and tripped over my feet and fell face first into one of the fridges. We were in the corner of the store but a young man (one of your staff) literally dropped what he was doing to get a first aider and some ice for my crying 3yo. He returned and he and the first aider stayed with me to help calm my daughter and get her back on her feet. I m so grateful for their help  as any mother will agree to  the crys of your child in pain can bring you close to tears yourself and these two wonderful members of your company helped me not to break down in front of my daughter and helped her to bounce back. So thank you and I m sorry I didn t get these people s names. But they were fabulous.					2016-10-25T13:29:56+0000	1477402196	2016-10-25 15:29:56	8	3	8	0	11	3	1	2	0	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchase a lot of products from Tesco and Tesco direct and have recommended it to a lot of my friends and family.   Unfortunately I will no longer be using Tesco services as I have received some bad service the last few times of using them.   Few months back I ordered a laptop through Tesco as I needed one urgently and they promised me that if I order before 3pm I can collect from my local store the next day. I was let down by this as the laptop didn t arrive and I had to wait for a week to get the laptop. They gave me ¬£6 compensation. Which I guess is something.   I decided to still shop with them. I wanted to order a iPhone 7 sim free this week as it s 20% off for staff and my dad works for them. They didn t have the 128gb black in stock so I spent a little more money and purchased the 256gb black one. As it said it was in stock. I went through with the transaction  they took my money within minutes. I then purchased a new SIM card with my network and bought the case for the new phone etc. The next day I receive a email from Tesco direct saying that they made a mistake and that I will not be getting the phone and will be refunded.   I am extremely disappointed as this is the second time of being let down by Tesco. Also they have now got my money in which I won t receive for 3-5 working days. Meaning I can t even purchase a phone from somewhere else as I don t have the funds to do so.   When calling them. They had not offered me anything in compensation seeing as it is their mistake in the first place.  I feel as if Tesco has purposely taken the stock off there website due to the 20% discount. When I check the day night before 20% started they were all available. Yet within the night they had all gone.   I feel as if as it s Tesco fault that they should allow me to purchase the phone at the price it is when I went through with the transaction. As it clearly was in stock otherwise it wouldn t have completed the transaction and taken my money so fast.   I will be making a formal complaint if the matter isn t resolved					2016-10-25T10:58:49+0000	1477393129	2016-10-25 12:58:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After my little girl had an accident falling out of a trolley and really hurting her face and head  the staff couldn t do anymore for us! I also had my newborn baby with me who needed feeding and he was provided for with hot water to heat his milk  plus a couple of spare bottles to take to hospital. An ambulance was called for my daughter straight away by a first aider  she was given a toy to distract her while being checked over  we were sectioned off for privacy with some screens and proceeded with chairs  my shopping was scanned and packed for us and dealt with  even the baby had a lovely time being held by various members or staff while I attended to my little girl. Thank you all so much  it was dealt with quickly and professionally and everyone involved deserves recognition for being so great  and a Christmas bonus üòÅ Aimee Healy  Erynn Healy  Ashley Healy and Jenny Pope (my Nan who was also with us) x					2016-10-25T10:32:43+0000	1477391563	2016-10-25 12:32:43	25	9	26	1	36	9	4	5	2	0	25	1	0	0	0	0	0

Went to open this to put on my sandwich  ripped the sticker and put my finger straight into the coleslaw  there was neither a plastic film over it or a lid!   I m grateful that:  1) I actually noticed as at 15 weeks pregnant making sandwiches with a noisy toddler in the background I sometimes think I ve lost my mind. Luckily my friend was with me to witness that there was definitely no packaging under the sticker that I had somehow missed! I dread to think of all of the contaminates that were in there and how poorly a bout of listeria would ve made me and my baby.   2) That the lady in Tesco Express Dosthill packed my bag very well because if that would ve gone slopping around my brand new car I would ve been incredibly annoyed.   Could you please try and identify the batch number and perhaps ask if stocks can be checked as I would hate for anyone else to experience this and not be as lucky. Thankfully all I had to intend with were dry sandwiches.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14671132_10154663287194451_7521177537724660347_n.jpg?oh=3afac43be3af6f2e09741cd7d11e1949&oe=58DAC2BA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14671132_10154663287194451_7521177537724660347_n.jpg?oh=afd1ce5a8d1f07a096aaa478a9c741cb&oe=58D7ECB7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154663287194451&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-24T23:06:38+0000	1477350398	2016-10-25 01:06:38	0	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

As I m sure you are aware  your  express  stores remain open for business until 11pm 7 days a week. An attribute I both depend upon and applaud. I therefore trust you will share my shock and horror when I  along with 2 close friends  made the familiar trip down to our local store  which falls within the PL4 catchment area of Plymouth. Specifically Alexandra Road. Upon arrival at said store we were met with the cold embrace of a closed and locked door  a full 13 minutes prior to the advertised closing time. This lead to an uncomfortable trip to the nearby co-op  an experience I would not wish on my worst enemy. The purpose of this letter  therefore  is not to set pulses racing or to dash the career aspirations of Tesco employees across the country. It is merely to express concern and to offer a helping hand to whatever emergency prompted this early closure tonight.  A speedy recovery is wished to all those involved.   May your shelves be ever filled and  your checkouts flashing green   Sincerely  Mr Thomas P Williams (BSc Hons)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14691039_10208858433351364_3391743664040120984_n.jpg?oh=9e3b2077be76376bcc05c5a617698167&oe=58EB5AE5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14691039_10208858433351364_3391743664040120984_n.jpg?oh=5b70db5a80648aa37c0ab534b9f64394&oe=58DF97E8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208858433351364&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-24T22:26:16+0000	1477347976	2016-10-25 00:26:16	442	26	472	35	533	24	10	14	111	0	438	3	1	26	0	0	0

My experience of buying a PC online which after 14months is unrepairable and being offered less than half its value does not feel like trying hard ! Being told that the matrix applied makes it uneconomical (for Tesco ) to give me anything approaching the refund I should be or replace it . SO BEWARE if you buy a PC from Tesco don t expect it to last more than 2years. Don t expect customer service just expect to be fobbed off. We treat people how they want to be treated . Joke number 2 I have made countless phone calls to get nowhere. No one listens just repeat policy as if it s a solution for me !! Customers want outcomes not to know why Tesco do what they do. It must have taken much more time and trouble to deal with this stupid situation in a prolonged manner than it would have cost to sort it fairly. I am getting Barclaycard to contest it and liaising with Consumer Rights . I will keep going until I get some justice but NO this is NOT how I want to be treated . When something goes wrong I want ownership of the problem and swift restitution. I am the one who has had no PC for months . My last one incidentally from Curry s lasted 10years !!! DONT buy from Tesco I won t because every little doesn t help me ! I can t do anything with the peanuts you are offering me back. You try to take every little you can from people. It will cost you what you make out of selling me a substandard product and refusing to put things right as I will not shop in Tesco at all because of this Food clothes anything . Not that you care !!

I put her in the baby seats of the trolly  once I entered the store I realised I had sat her in a seat full of dust and dirt. (It was dark outside when I put her in it) also the seat next to her had bird poo all over it. When I spoke to the person on customer service she just said she would speak to a manager  I didn t even get an apology.  After this I went outside to find another one and they were all as grubby bar one. This is not acceptable especially when they are for such little babies.					2016-10-24T21:17:15+0000	1477343835	2016-10-24 23:17:15	2	9	2	0	11	9	5	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I realised today that when I pay with PayQwiq my receipt shows I have 705 points but when I use my club card and pay by cash it shows up that I have 1009 points. I m pretty sure my points have never gone down on PayQwiq when the vouchers come out so it seems as though they don t get added onto my normal club card like I thought they would. My details have defiantly been put on the app correctly because my staff discount works even though as I ve just noticed the last 4 digits on the club card section on my PayQwiq receipt are different to my normal card.

I ve noticed on the vouchers I ve received today that it states if you miss a week then skip to the next weeks voucher  so technically the voucher I handed over could have been used on that particular shopping trip?

I have just been into one of your shops wearing full motorcycle gear. Upon entering I was approached by the security guard asking me to remove my helmet. I didn t bat an eye lid as I was asked nicely and I obliged and removed my helmet.  Although  while I m walking to collect my item of choice (wine) i saw at least 5 people whose faces were completely covered.   You can see more of a face in a motorcycle helmet than you can in a burkha. (No racial intension just stating fact)   Why were these not asked to show their faces or is it just me or bikers in general?   I have lived in Essex for almost 5 years and not ONCE has anyone approached me while I m walking around with my helmet on in the branches down there. Or any other store for that matter.

Just thought I d let you know that your apple packer has only put 5 apples in all your 6 packs. Same price just one less apple. I m sure this is a mistake because you can t possibly think your customers are this stupid. Many thanks.

And I don t think my little chap would be grateful for melted plastic in his curry!!! Wouldnt mind you paying for my microwave to be cleaned either  or the petrol it cost to get it  or the petrol it costs to get another one when you inevitably offer me a gift card for the amount (the last three have never arrived!!!!). Thanks again Tesco  for ruining a great evening. I ll order a takeaway next time  or buy Asda ones.

I also spoke to his manager Jamie to re - emphasise the effort Alan had gone to! Top notch!

Never arrived so called tesco 3 times between 11am -12pm  no one could get in contact with the driver or the store. So  i am told they will continue to chase and will call back once they have an update.  I get a call and text to say the shopping will arrive by 1.30 approx.  It is now 2.20 and i had to call again to find out what is happening.  Still waiting for someone to call back.  So  nearly 3 1/2 hrs after my delivery slot i am non the wiser and this has caused such an inconvenience and ruined a planned afternoon out.  I have shopped with Tesco for many years and have been a loyal customer who spends on average ¬£100-¬£150 per week  i get told they will give me a ¬£5 voucher as goodwill.....really  are you joking me!!!					2016-10-24T13:24:32+0000	1477315472	2016-10-24 15:24:32	0	11	3	0	14	11	6	5	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

When my car steering broke down I managed to  get it to the Tesco car park.  When I had to go off with the AA man these lovely ladies helped my elderly and disabled sister to get a mini cab home with her shopping.  They stayed with her and made sure she was OK until her cab arrived.   I really grateful to them for their help and would like Tesco to know how good some of their staff are.  Thanks again ladies.

I m afraid it s not very good change. My friends and I frequently enjoyed this soup and many other products from Tesco  as a nice lunchtime break in-between our busy working day but today we have been disappointed. The soup is too salty  it s not spicy and tastes very tangy. More of a tomato soup then Mexican Chilli.   Please can you revert back to the previous recipe otherwise we will be forced to search for other lunchtime options?

Or so we thought! We re not actually sure as the label on the doughnuts was for apple filled doughnuts. As I was about to hand the doughnuts out I noticed the label  5 Apple filled doughnuts  so I couldn t allow the children to have them as the wrong label was on the pack! It s SO vital the right label is on the packaging - my son s allergy in particular is classed as severe. Granted I could have double checked the label but when you re rushing and checking you just look for the  contains  information. I should be able to trust that a store as large as Tesco labels food correctly. Very disappointing and dangerous!

However I m really unhappy at the tendency of this store to remove popular selling products; such as Udi s Tiger Loaf as an example. They are then replaced with Tesco s own version of free from breads and products.  Due to levels of sensitivity and variance  many coeliac and gluten free people find a brand or make of bread that suits them and stick to it. This isn t easily reproduced by another manufacturer  particularly a non specialist branching out into perhaps a lucrative but incredibly nuanced area. Some of us react or experience adverse reactions to certain types of gluten free products  for some reason  and we learn what works.   It s particularly galling when it is a popular product that is then phased out and remains unstocked - only to be replaced by an alternative supermarket version and to take away consumer choice by not stocking the original.   Please can you address this insidious policy of replacing reputable gluten free food manufacturers with own brand free from products- or at least stock both so that consumers are given the best choice. At least then your customers are still purchasing from you. Currently  even though I am about two minutes away from our Tesco Extra  I will now be taking my custom elsewhere due to the fact your bread is unsuitable for my needs.   Many Thanks.   #coeliacuk #udi #coeliac #glutenfree #freefrom					2016-10-24T11:10:02+0000	1477307402	2016-10-24 13:10:02	11	7	11	3	21	7	5	2	10	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

My elderly mum bought a phone from Tesco in May. Charger broken. Tesco refused to help and gave her number to ring where they said she had to go to Nokia. Nokia are not contactable. She has been trying for days. She feels vulnerable driving without her phone and feels forced to buy a new one with working charger. I think Tesco have a responsibility for products they sold.					2016-10-24T10:55:16+0000	1477306516	2016-10-24 12:55:16	0	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It remained unopened until the following week as we had gone away the same day.  The other day he had been using it in his personal office and took a 30 minute break  when he came back the screen was bleeding inside on itself and is now un usable. He took the laptop back to the Westwood cross store on 22/10/2016 to either get a replacement or money back only to get a really bad attitude from one of the staff there and was told to call acer for a replacement/repair and was given a ¬£10 tesco gift card.

We are completely broke and have a maximum weekly spend of ¬£50 a month. We have been receiving vouchers of similar large amounts every time and i bin them because we never spend that much. Instead we shop at Aldi for nearly everything as it fits out budget. Yet my best friend gets regular vouchers from you for spend ¬£30 get ¬£5-¬£8 off her shop. Its  a bit unfair  if we had that kind of voucher  you d see me a lot more at Tesco  but sadly Aldi works out a better deal.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14639590_10157614812855082_3906565985475426109_n.jpg?oh=f77c696576d06c7b5e5e37699f00cce7&oe=58EFBB4A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/14639590_10157614812855082_3906565985475426109_n.jpg?oh=3143e7215229300a54749c075748478d&oe=58E93059	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157614812855082&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-24T10:24:36+0000	1477304676	2016-10-24 12:24:36	3	12	3	0	15	12	3	9	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

We used to grow hyacinth and make shoe boxes full of festive cheer and staples to help when the need for heating was stronger than the need for food.  Now as an adult I would like to continue this age old tradition and I am now looking for some help to give as many elderly people in my local area a little bit of ease and maybe for a minute forget the worry of food and heating costs. Would you be willing to support my cause and be able to pledge some help towards the people who grew us and our country and now need us to make their lives just that little bit easier.					2016-10-23T21:45:54+0000	1477259154	2016-10-23 23:45:54	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went into your Weston Favell store in Northampton yesterday  (22/10/16) and purchased some Jasmine rice - along with other stuff. I got home and poured my rice out into the pan.... and there is black bugs crawling all through it!  I was absolutely horrified  when I looked into the bag of rice there were at least another 50 of these things trying to escape!  I poured the rice into a clear bag and took the entire thing straight back to the store! I have to say the staff were absolutely horrified as well  and the lady at the customer service desk literally screamed as she opened the bag! They were very helpful in store though  but I was not given a reference number or anything regarding my complaint  so I am now worried that nobody will contact me or even sort this out!  I m disgusted to also see that I m not the only one who has experienced this! üò∑	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/14694172_10154469237910351_743361270165536768_n.jpg?oh=fe0147819326cdfc7df08a82cd8e50a3&oe=58EDD3F6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/14694172_10154469237910351_743361270165536768_n.jpg?oh=ae3513cd13194304df8d36ace13714b0&oe=591F8F8D	https://www.facebook.com/10154302576975351/videos/10154469236410351	facebook.com	2016-10-23T21:12:07+0000	1477257127	2016-10-23 23:12:07	0	6	0	2	8	6	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In my experience from past halloweens they take weeks to go like this after carving. And when Tesco apologies and ask for more pictures and the receipt  I don t have the receipt it was on my grocery shop  which I disregard after checking however it may be nice if you keep in mind when offering me a replacement that my nearest Tesco is 15 miles away this will take 35 minutes of my time each way plus fuel. I have to say it would be much better if your quality checks where improved and I didn t have to keep on complaining about substandard produce.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14633083_663719073803367_436443945567416359_n.jpg?oh=1260402464138c8f9cfc3b5626b10eb6&oe=591E0A68	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14633083_663719073803367_436443945567416359_n.jpg?oh=a1d75fa85093442c969fdf943b69a4c8&oe=58EE3A9F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=663719073803367&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-23T20:56:16+0000	1477256176	2016-10-23 22:56:16	2	4	2	1	7	3	3	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I cut into it  it was still completely raw  the picture is where i have cut around the middle. It was completely red.

It is beautiful that colleagues around the country are fundraising for her to go to Disney land. It does sadden me though that a company as big as Tesco can t see a wish come true through their own money. I do hope she makes her trip there					2016-10-23T17:00:44+0000	1477242044	2016-10-23 19:00:44	2	5	2	3	10	5	1	4	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I arrange donations for the Glasgow South West food banks quite regularly. I collect donations from friends and family and usually have to arrange a van or 3-4 car trips to drop off my collection. This was incredibly inconvenient and would often dishearten me because I would worry less about how I was going to be able to collect enough donations to help people and more about how I was actually going to get the donations to them.  As you can see from the below photo - that trolley is an example of one person s donation!   I phoned Tesco twice today and spoke to two gentleman  firstly Bradley and then Graham. They were both incredibly helpful and took on board my predicament. They kindly added all the addresses for the Glasgow South West food banks to the home delivery system and approved them with the local store. They told me this would take 72 hours to update; but from then on  I would be able to arrange a Tesco delivery directly to the food bank.   I would like to thank you for helping me help others! Bradley and Graham were very understanding about the work I was trying to do and I really appreciate the support.  Thanks Tesco!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14732296_1576638285695681_6082572417449346899_n.jpg?oh=08fc51aeac199c159c389233c3920078&oe=58DBC971	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14732296_1576638285695681_6082572417449346899_n.jpg?oh=a00b9bb7066c177f0ac68cf908b13b1b&oe=58E98A64	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1576638285695681&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-23T16:34:47+0000	1477240487	2016-10-23 18:34:47	55	6	61	1	68	6	4	2	14	0	52	6	0	0	0	0	0

Today we visited and just as we had entered the store my 2 year old little boy managed to cover him and his daddy with sick.   The first person I came across for help was Wendy who really couldn t do enough to help us! In fact she was amazing and made us feel totally at ease.  It s most parents nightmare to be in this position  as you feel awkward and normally made to feel like a burden  but not with Wendy she did everything within her power to make sure he was happy and clean before leaving the store.  It s people like her that really make a difference and I will certainly be returning to thank her personally!  So tesco s please make this a big deal so she knows how much we appreciate her.   Thank you  The Bell Family XXX  (Anyone that knows Wendy please tag/show her).					2016-10-23T16:31:49+0000	1477240309	2016-10-23 18:31:49	43	11	45	18	74	10	3	7	9	0	42	2	0	0	0	0	0

My sister found these bat droppings chocolates and thought they would be fun to share with her friends I wasn t until I got home that I was reading what the chocolates had in them before I tried and I was shocked to see these are actually dogs treats ... I am horrified that these where with all the other Halloween chocolate for children and I am extremely worried the parents are buying these without thought to what they are and allowing their children to eat them  .. Dog treats SHOULD NEVER be with children s chocolate ..  I think Tesco have been very careless with their product placement and I will be going back into the store tomorrow (as its now shut as its Sunday) and will be complaining to them making sure they are removed from the children s chocolate area	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14680718_10210703525650495_2300600563443298015_n.jpg?oh=9d6dad8373bd8db8e555e53620b8b9a4&oe=58EC454B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14680718_10210703525650495_2300600563443298015_n.jpg?oh=ca3bc94095fc4b7c627f41b5c96f7f0e&oe=58E9A446	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210703525650495&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-23T15:27:12+0000	1477236432	2016-10-23 17:27:12	1	3	1	3	7	3	3	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I returned to the Shoreham by sea store today and saw the toy was back on the shelf so I assumed your error had been resolved. How wrong I was as again when scanned was not on your system so was just put on the shelves for me to be told for the second time I couldn t purchase it. Not good tescos once maybe but not twice very poor service.					2016-10-23T15:25:05+0000	1477236305	2016-10-23 17:25:05	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have another picture of more of the mould upon more grapes if you need it.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14713523_10210985439055563_7892700752988619794_n.jpg?oh=21858353edb4b217f30ff9dfaa1fece0&oe=58EF44B7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14713523_10210985439055563_7892700752988619794_n.jpg?oh=82f4927ec25e2e3d393f896a016b54b5&oe=58E759BA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210985439055563&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-23T12:59:12+0000	1477227552	2016-10-23 14:59:12	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Massive thanks to Michelle who was really helpful when I first had to chose my glasses and then when I went back as they were not comfortable - she arranged a retest which showed my prescription was wrong !

The supervisor was dismissive  rude and most unhelpful. The problem was two jigsaws we were trying to buy weren t scanning  our checkout lad who was really nice  called the supervisor over whose only words to the check out lad were  well we can t sell it then. He was embarrassed at her reaction to the problem  we were flabbergasted that she wouldn t find a solution for us. No apology was forth coming from her. She had her tesco coat over her shoulder   not wearing her uniform on the shop floor.  Earlier in the day we had a ps4 pro that was preordered cancelled on us  the generic email that the company sends out needs addressing as you were  extremely  extremely what ? Sorry  that word was missing from the email  very bad grammar!  Thirdly whilst I m here  the new delivery slots and pricing aren t doing you any favours ~ seriously thinking of shopping elsewhere with a better custom service team.					2016-10-23T10:49:28+0000	1477219768	2016-10-23 12:49:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I hadn t even heard of Tesco Easy Entertaining until I stumbled across it online.   My partner and I ordered a selection of things for my sons 5th birthday  as we were having the whole family round to celebrate. This included  sandwiches  cakes  the American platter and pizza.  From the moment I picked it up from store I was impressed. The packaging it was placed in meant all the food kept its shape and wasn t squashed or damaged (most helpful when cake is involved)  the sandwiches were filled nicely  the mini cupcakes were delicious and the pizza was even bigger than I thought it was going to be! (We didn t even use both pizzas!)   The price we paid was more then fair and it was so much easier not having to worry about doing it all myself.   You should advertise these much more! Especially with the party season coming up. I know I ll be recommending it.   Well done Tesco!üëçüèª And thank you for making the food part of my sons party so much easier!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14642124_10154209850574833_2772461973743056412_n.jpg?oh=6802533f65ebfa0437dad29073614bfc&oe=58EE21B9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14642124_10154209850574833_2772461973743056412_n.jpg?oh=81ff752c57e773212e39ee31c4d7ea9c&oe=58E6EDCD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154209850574833&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-23T09:00:14+0000	1477213214	2016-10-23 11:00:14	3	2	3	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

She s a football fan and plays for the school team too. Unfortunately   because of the stereotypes that we still have in this age and day  poor kid had to make a tough choice between a flowery cake and a football one for her birthday..She said she d love the football cake but thought it was for boys.. In the end she said     I wish I could have a bit of both!  Looking for some help/ positive reinforcement  we asked one of your employees if this was only a  boys cake ? the positive and helpful lad said   certainly not if you love football!  And then he suggested that she could always decorate the football if she liked! He also showed us some beautiful edible fondant flowers. I m sharing the final version.

However over the last 12 mths your shop in newton aycliffe has gotton worse and worse. There have been multiple times where the car park is full with rubbish. A van was abondoned in the carpark for months! And as far as the inside is concerned the amount of times we have gone in and the shelves have been empty and boxes are left in the isle is getting far too common practice! Your meat hardly lasts days before going off especially your chicken. The quality seems appauling! Then today i bought breadbuns in my shopping and inside i saw a fly trapped inside the packaging!! Which is disgusting and disturbing. Why are flys near where you a baking and packaging! It concerns me massively. I have thrown these out as these will now have been covered in fly lave. I dont know why i continue going to tesco and this is now making me question why i keep going back especially having aldi 100 meteres away!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14731111_10154632721254282_1738649514311523397_n.jpg?oh=52be218b342ede1d2790799ff0ed3d3a&oe=591B46B0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14731111_10154632721254282_1738649514311523397_n.jpg?oh=0f896de2ae744634f4cb5b1968e6135d&oe=58D724BD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154632721254282&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-22T20:52:36+0000	1477169556	2016-10-22 22:52:36	0	17	1	0	18	14	6	8	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I rang 111 and they sent an emergency ambulance for me as needed seen asap. As we were leaving i remembered we were getting shopping delivered so we rang and rescheduled for tonight explaining why. The delivery guy just came tonight with shopping and handed me a bunch of flowers from tesco.  This is why I love working for tesco bank  thanks Tesco üòÜ	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14705639_1129797857098807_9107626739783933217_n.jpg?oh=79b5cd550ab19b93e5dd178e1cfdf35b&oe=58DB9E8F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14705639_1129797857098807_9107626739783933217_n.jpg?oh=c8dd7e1cf8ec915007b4846e373757c2&oe=58DDA89A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1129797857098807&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-22T20:35:07+0000	1477168507	2016-10-22 22:35:07	20	1	21	0	22	1	1	0	0	0	20	1	0	0	0	0	0

Not only have I observed this in your own branded products (please see attached photograph) but also on in-store signage in Callington Road Tesco  Bristol.  As a regular customer  I feel that we should be informed as to whether this is an innocent mistake which will be corrected at the earliest opportunity  or if your company is acting as the compliant partner in an insidious and creeping American cultural imperialism.  I await your response with great interest.

Got the 6 hot dog rolls for 65p. Paid for them at the self scanners  lifted the bag (didn t have a carrier) and the 6 rolls bombed out onto the floor. Apologised and the nice lassie there to help said I could collect another pack. Thanks very much to her by the way  appreciated that. Collected another packet and headed home  only to realise one of the rolls was brick hard as that packet was already burst. Going by how hard the roll was  it had been burst for some time. The Tesco packaging on loaves and rolls is much too thin I think  so easy to burst open. Shame  because the Tesco bakery is great.					2016-10-22T19:09:20+0000	1477163360	2016-10-22 21:09:20	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon looking for mozzarella dippers in almost every aisle we found ourselves amongst your frozen goods - we met John next to the party food - he was dressed in his Tesco uniform and his trolley had approximately 48 beers in! I proceeded to ask John. John looked approachable like he would a man that you could rely on for your food needs....  Excuse me please  but where would I find your mozzarella dippers.  I directed at John with a huge smile his reply.  I have no idea.  To which he proceeded to walk off in the opposite direction.  I looked at my driving companion scared that we may have to head further in her car to find our mozzarella dippers. She returned my look and we proceeded to head back to the chilled section. I looked at my designated driver and told her  it s ok  John had probably finished work and was heading to a party with all that beer.  We returned to the chilled section where (I may get this wrong) Kazlick was sorting the 2 mains 2 sides for ¬£6 section. I approached him on my hunt.  Excuse me  do you sell mozzarella dippers  Mmmm his reply  mozzarella dippers?  He walked off and I followed. He approached his colleague who s name I did not catch but before he could ask after my mozzarella dippers this man proceeded to shout at him about not putting the 2 pint of semi skimmed milk on the shelves - poor Kazlick was only trying to help me - he finally got chance to ask and they were pointed out to me by shouty milk man - not a smile on site. At this point my friend found me she has also found alternative mozzarella dippers for the same price but in different packaging on the chilled section we were puzzled but we thanked Kazlick and went to pay. Upon paying - our service with a smile continued to be non existent. As we were leaving we realised we had forgotten the limes - so I headed to the fruit section to which both members of staff on said section were too busy flirting to direct me to where they were so I found them myself. The only person who redeemed this terrible shopping experience was the man on customer services who was friendly  approachable and all that a person in retail should be. Whilst paying I noticed John having a good old chat with the security card so my thoughts about him finishing work were quickly dismissed and he obviously just isn t very good at his job. Overall my visit to Tesco today was disappointing.  I would probably give it a 4/10 and that s being nice. We are eating said mozzarella dippers right now and I must say I just wish I had held the handle in the car and let me friend take us a little bit further to Waitrose.  This taught me to trust my friend and not men called John who work at Tesco. In this case every little didn t help In fact John was helpless.					2016-10-22T18:11:36+0000	1477159896	2016-10-22 20:11:36	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

It seems to be leaking from the toilet  as the smell is terrible. Tomorrow is the NFL match at the Rugby stadium and it would be a bad view of Twickenham and Tesco to the many visitors that will flood in if it is not rapidly fixed. Many thanks.

According to my online account I have received ten coupons in the last six months  but I haven t received any nor has any every been available on my account. Is this due to the fact that my account had been changed to say that I did not want to receive marketing or money off offers from Tesco? If that is the case  why was I never informed that this was now the case as I have never changed these details?  It s gotten a bit ridiculous just how much the incentive schemes have been cut down over the last year  adding to that that the shop continues to use confusing and misleading offers in store and the fact that I have gone from getting coupons every time I got my vouchers to not getting anything at all has not put Tesco in any more of a favourable light with me.					2016-10-22T17:20:25+0000	1477156825	2016-10-22 19:20:25	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just visited & they had raw meat that was reduced out of the chillers. When I spoke to a member of staff   Omar  I was told very rudely  It doesn t matter if they are out  they are usually sold within 20 minutes  The meat (I believe it was pork) was already starting to turn grey. Very disgusted with the attitude from the staff.					2016-10-22T14:57:44+0000	1477148264	2016-10-22 16:57:44	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He asked if I would be in later and then said he would go back to the store and find me some fish in time for dinner - I hope that these comments find their way to the Ely management team and to Wesley with our appreciation!					2016-10-22T13:54:06+0000	1477144446	2016-10-22 15:54:06	10	2	10	0	12	2	1	1	3	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am so disappointed that I can t buy single packets of Walkers beef and onion crisps anywhere  not in store  not online  nowhere. They won the Walkers competition as the favourite flavour to bring back and yet still I can t buy them. I can t be trusted with a multi pack before you suggest that so I am missing out big time !   I ve just done my online shop with you and checked again to see if anything had changed  it hadn t. I was also gutted to see that you now no longer sell the single packets of Walkers marmite either ! üò≠üëé   I would buy these flavours every day in the Tesco Express near work if I could  so gutted I can t.  I ve contacted Walkers and they say I need to ask you. Come on Tesco !! Please !					2016-10-22T11:37:45+0000	1477136265	2016-10-22 13:37:45	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been to collect my shopping this morning at Kings Lynn hardwick Tesco and they ve lost part of it. Order number 25439591 I ve already had a few deliveries where the driver has gone off with part of my shopping. Now I ve got to wait for a call for the rest of the shopping to be delivered.  I need this to be delivered promptly this afternoon and not forgotten and left for hours like a previous incident.  It s needed for a meal at 4.  I have a disabled daughter and I m supposed to be relaxing for an hour or two but instead I now feel like I ve got to rush home just in case it turns up as my daughters carer doesn t know the routine I have for my daughter when shopping comes.

Totally amazed at this click and collect at Hemel Hempstead. 7 items in 7 bags. Whether we paid for them or not is irrelevant. We are all expected to do our bit for the environment. When we questioned this at collection we were told   he always does that but he s the only one  . So how long has this been going on and how many unnecessary bags have gone through.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14702243_10154617364324941_3456141795043591541_n.jpg?oh=b615f901ca2d77d2b82bd879b23ec8eb&oe=58E8A6E5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14702243_10154617364324941_3456141795043591541_n.jpg?oh=d9c48cc29b72412c34218044ee733a71&oe=58DA3091	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154617364324941&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-22T10:14:07+0000	1477131247	2016-10-22 12:14:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Popped into my local helston Tesco yesterday before our road trip to Southampton.  Picked up a few bits to keep us going   Your Tesco finest pigs in blanket flavoured crisps. Wtf? I popped open the bag  popped a crisp into my mouth. It was soggy like the bag had been open a week  but as I stated the bag was full of air. It was vile. So now I have to endure a long road trip with no crisps and a hangry boyfriend. Thanks Tesco üò§ I d return them but they were only ¬£1 and TBH I m only writing this cause I m bored.   On the other hand your pork and sweet chilli sausage rolls are lush.					2016-10-22T09:46:31+0000	1477129591	2016-10-22 11:46:31	3	7	5	0	12	7	4	3	6	0	3	0	0	2	0	0	0

How s this for great customer service... My mum Thelma lives nearby in a retirement apartment. The Tesco store is convenient for her and being disabled it s given her a new found independence being able to shop on her own. The staff are always so friendly and look out for her. A few weeks ago mum fell and broke her hip - she s been in hospital and is now recovering well at home. This evening mum went into Tesco and the staff gave her flowers and chocolates! And one of the staff (possibly the Manager) helped her home with her shopping and gifts! I can t tell you how delighted mum is about this act of kindness! Thank you everyone at Tesco for being so kind and thoughtful.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14691010_10154150311934514_1720917561186915598_n.jpg?oh=d2dbe0cbdcaf8a069ddc77d2d68d9bc3&oe=58E00FEF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14691010_10154150311934514_1720917561186915598_n.jpg?oh=3b8de1a23f1fd9281691460873cc38dd&oe=58D5D6E2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154150311934514&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-22T09:39:11+0000	1477129151	2016-10-22 11:39:11	60	8	69	3	80	8	6	2	7	0	60	9	0	0	0	0	0

The blatant disregard for customer service is exactly why I prefer a trip to Asda anyway. However my 4 year old was very keen to get the trolls stickers for her albums but after a trip every day to get them and being faced with the staffs inability to bother to give her them I ve thrown in the towel. What s the point in getting a child s hopes up if the shop won t give her the tokens claiming they only received one set. Nice work Tesco  my daughter is in bits.					2016-10-22T08:07:08+0000	1477123628	2016-10-22 10:07:08	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I and another person waited 10 minutes for attention while staff stood behind the screen. Eventually another member of staff arrived. I complained about the wait for service. She took my script  went to a shelf  put my items in a basket and back on another shelf  said it would be 15 minutes. Again i complained  the assistant told me to go to Customer services. There I was given a card with the store number and E mail address  when i went on line it was a customer survey. nothing else. On a previous occasion I went to collect a script and was told I was not due one. When I contacted the Surgery Iwas tols Tesco had my script 8 days previously. The service in this store is shocking More staff are needed to avoid loss of custom   or is it a ploy to keep customers in the staff shopping? i ont be going again.i would rather travel the miles to the next store.					2016-10-22T07:09:15+0000	1477120155	2016-10-22 09:09:15	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Have taken the advice from your helpline and uninstalled and reinstalled the app after clearing browsing history etc.  Something is seriously wrong. Am beyond frustrated and understand there have been 8 problems like mine today..Have re entered my card details and persevered but am now giving up. Thought I might be able to pay over the phone  but your system does not allow this  so goodbye to my order. I won t have the weekend I planned but I sincerely hope you are able to sort this out soon  as you are going to lose revenue and loyalty.  Had this problem last week but re entering the card details worked on that occasion. Also had a problem the week before that when I had to change my password as the previous and original one was not recognised. I spend a considerable amount of money with you and you are most definitely my preferred supplier  your delivery people are excellent and I cannot fault the pickers and packers. Please don t let them all down by this one hiccup.					2016-10-21T22:04:21+0000	1477087461	2016-10-22 00:04:21	0	15	1	0	16	15	2	13	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter is inquisitive and Jane was really helpful in answering some questions about the fish and where they come from. Explained to my daughter about elements of her job and how she has to move the fish around as people buy it to make sure it looks appealing.  I really appreciate that Jane didn t sugar coat anything  she treated my little girl with respect and explained things in a way that she could understand.

All staff were really helpful and showed genuine concern and so grateful for the paediatric nurse (a lady on holiday from Durham!) that came to our rescue!

For example many say I wanted to use the disabled toilet or wanted to park in the disabled bay. Define the word disabled? You        use a disabled toilet if ie the toilet couldn t flush or the seat was broken wouldn t you? Eh. I don t think so. The word disabled is defined as faulty. Eventually many might see my point of view.					2016-10-21T19:51:40+0000	1477079500	2016-10-21 21:51:40	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Rang up the help desk to be told the driver had tried to contact me a couple of times in the day but could not so he took my delivery back to store :(  The reason - could not process my payment card.  I have a club card plus and there was 3 times the value of my order on it so it wasn t lack of funds!  Now I understand this can happen with cards but what I can t understand is that nobody contacted me on either phone number instead chose to leave me sitting there waiting!  I was relying on my delivery for tonights dinner so ended up with having to have a takeaway so I m now ¬£ 30 out of pocket and still no shopping.  You manage to text me every week telling me my delivery is booked so why not this week!!!!  Not impressed - very poor show.					2016-10-21T19:38:06+0000	1477078686	2016-10-21 21:38:06	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have used Tesco delivery for years now and I would not have it any other way. I am always happy with the service and the delivery drivers have become like friends. We particularly have one driver who goes above and beyond ever time. My kids are so happy to see him and he always makes us smile. He is called Mario and works in the Newcastle/ north Tyneside area. It would make me so happy if he could be acknowledged for excelling in customer service. He is such a lovely  genuine guy that you are so lucky to have working for Tesco.

I would like to thank the staff in your Flitwick  Bedfordshire store for being not only extremely helpful but going above and beyond the call of duty today.  My 9 year old son was playing at the park with his friends after school and some children took it upon themselves to bully and threaten him.  He made his way into Tesco and asked the lovely lady at customer service if he could use a phone to call and ask me to collect him. The lady called me herself  explained what had happened and kept my son in the store talking to him until I got there. When I arrived she even walked him out to pass him over to me. To top it off  he had his bike there  which wouldn t fit in my car. So another member of staff put his bike in their car and delivered it back to my home address.   I think you ll agree this was over answer beyond the call of duty. Their kindness and compassion  really has touched me. Unfortunately I was so worried about my son I failed to make a note of their names but I will return tomorrow to find out. They should be rewarded highly for their excellent customer service.					2016-10-21T17:38:39+0000	1477071519	2016-10-21 19:38:39	2914	113	3150	154	3417	113	103	10	124	0	2890	219	15	0	0	0	0

I ordered my shopping from you online this week. I d usually shop in Aldi.   I thought I d treat myself to a couple of small bottles of my favourite wine. It s familiar and has never let me down.  Until now...   It tastes like vinegar  not the good vinegar  it s definitely not balsamic!  I also treated myself to a melt in the middle chocolate pudding  but what will accompany it now??

We visit most days to the store and when my son is with me he likes to matter with the checkout staff. He is autistic and doesn t read body language very well. But he does love a good natter about whatever he is thinking about and gets most upset if they don t talk and engage with him. Thankfully most of the staff know him now and endure happily his conversations about PlayStation games etc showing an interest in him. This enables me to pack the shopping and keeps him happy at the same time! A big thanks to the checkout staff especially laura and Helen who work on the self serve!					2016-10-21T16:11:11+0000	1477066271	2016-10-21 18:11:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought a few bits  6 things actually. Went to the self services till to pay. The screen was on the usual  home  screen where it said start. There was also a bit that said cards only  no coins or cash or something similar. This wasn t a problem as I was using my card any way.  I scanned my first item  a cake that was ¬£2.65. I put it in the bag and as I went to get item No. 2 to scan  I noticed the screen showed my one item at ¬£2.65 but the total at the bottom of the screen was ¬£5.25.  I Calle dyne assistant over. She looked puzzled. Suggested we cancel the transaction and start again. This now worked fine.  I asked her how this happened. Her answer was that the person before me had moved tills! But there were no other items listed  otherwise I would have noticed them.  She said oh it does it sometimes. It would be ok any way as you could get your money back from customer services. Oh that s ok the.  Assuming of course I realised the total was wrong or checked my receipt.  So how often does this happen? How often does a shopper unknowingly pay for something they haven t had? Would some older or with a learning disability be expected to notice? Not saying they wouldn t notice but it would be harder.  Extra few quid. Multiplied  by how many people  how many stores?  Every little helps!					2016-10-21T13:33:41+0000	1477056821	2016-10-21 15:33:41	3	26	3	0	29	26	4	22	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

But when my husband went in our local store (One of the large stores in Hemel Hempstead) to pick up a Tesco direct brochure so mum could browse herself  they had none??? Where can i get one Tesco?

As I previously mentioned  you closed my credit card account due to inactivity. I used the account to make a payment so that you would not close it. However you closed it with a balance on it. So that leads us to paying off the amount. A I had a direct debit attached I wasn t worried. But when you closed the account you cancelled the direct debit. Now you have charged me ¬£12 for late payment. How on earth do you end up with procedures and systems so full of illogic? Please advise?					2016-10-21T10:30:09+0000	1477045809	2016-10-21 12:30:09	4	5	4	0	9	5	1	4	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I popped into Tesco at Wath upon Dearne yesterday and found two lovely tops. Once at the cash desk I realised I didn t have my card with me  infact I had left it in another store the night before. I told the cashier my dilemma and asked if she could save the tops for me which totalled ¬£65 and I would pick them up tomorrow morning. The assistant replied No we cannot do that we haven t the room  you must collect them today. I told her as I have to travel back to town to collect my card I wouldn t have time as I am going to work. She was totally unsympathetic and said it s the policy  nothing I can do. She could see I was upset  but didn t seen to care. It s ironic that the staff all wear badges with  here to help   and your motto is  every liitle helps  Just to let u know Tesco I see myself as being a very loyal customer. I have shopped in this branch since it opened spending on average ¬£250 a month plus my husband fills his car every month in their petrol station. After yesterday I feel that you don t value this loyalty and questioning why do I bother and just take my custom else where.  I ve not bothered going back to the shop for the tops if your interested.					2016-10-21T10:08:03+0000	1477044483	2016-10-21 12:08:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

(My 5 year old step son said it too!) He has spent the first hour of the half term holidays scouring the pages  marking off what he wants with the stickers and writing a list of his most wanted toys. He is now going back through the pages and completing all of the puzzles and looking at where the other stickers should go.  As much as I am happy that it is keeping him entertained  this is going to cost us a fortune! I think I m going to have to get a tesco credit card to pay for it all!					2016-10-21T08:52:56+0000	1477039976	2016-10-21 10:52:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After the hour long drive  got there to find they had sold out. Then drove a further 10 miles to another swansea store after phoning and told there was a book stock of 2.

I ordered (as shown in my email  not what it says on the delivery note!!) Persil washing powder (45 wash) for ¬£5.50 and have instead received two small 23 wash boxes. Not a problem you would think until I checked the delivery note and realised you had charged me ¬£7 for each box!! That s ¬£14 in your pocket  rather than the ¬£5.50 I should have actually paid. Sadly we only noticed after the delivery man had left so we now have the hassle of chasing this up with you guys instead - bam goes the convenience of online shopping once again.  While I m here I may aswell mention the banana yogurts we ve received  rather than the toffee ones too (Which again  it says on the delivery note we have toffee ones  but we actually have 1 toffee and 2 banana)  Thirdly our freezer shopping arrived unpacked because you d run out of bags.. couldn t you find a substitute bag? Or not charge us full price for bags given you didn t pack it all? It s only 40p but a bit cheeky really.   I haven t finished picking my way through the rest of the cupboard shopping yet because it s late  I m tired and my little one will be up in approximately 7 hours but I m hoping I won t have to add to the  wrong price/item  list in the morning.  Please let me know when we ll receive a refund for the ridiculous price errors and remind your staff about substitutes and not overcharging customers!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14702456_10158119700380497_9156172843664977087_n.jpg?oh=6c0f928d744d6597e1c9431e0c2281f6&oe=58E01015	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14702456_10158119700380497_9156172843664977087_n.jpg?oh=c67d8d521a7a1646fc336fae567018e5&oe=591C5718	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158119700380497&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-20T21:34:43+0000	1476999283	2016-10-20 23:34:43	2	22	2	0	24	22	7	15	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is also shorter than the 5-6 pinafore I bought in August.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14671191_10153833466395685_2981142176443567576_n.jpg?oh=b093baf492c12380a64a382ea3e887c2&oe=591E8491	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14671191_10153833466395685_2981142176443567576_n.jpg?oh=921d1680082d5cb20870b9a75ca1816a&oe=58E00F9C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153833466395685&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-20T21:29:25+0000	1476998965	2016-10-20 23:29:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My eldest son walked into my basket  whilst I was turning round to answer his question. He sobbed and instantly started to turn red. Neil  a fantastic man that was stacking shelves  came to the rescue. He took us to the ice cream section and instantly found children s ice cream. He then led us to the customer desk for further assistance. Lovely Chloe then checked William was OK and got him a cold compress. She opened the ice creams and gave one to him and one to his panicking brother... What could have been a devastating melt down (and for William a long few weeks of hating going to Tesco) was solved within minutes and without fuss... What amazing staff you have Tesco. I am truly grateful.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14681731_10157508116220532_6936356870646436460_n.jpg?oh=2774bba763f6eebbea4e25949d25da7c&oe=58DB2FCE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14681731_10157508116220532_6936356870646436460_n.jpg?oh=0aa468e9dd0f4a006c2cc3c4e1978fd1&oe=5918C469	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157508116220532&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-20T20:23:49+0000	1476995029	2016-10-20 22:23:49	17	6	22	0	28	6	5	1	3	0	16	5	0	0	0	0	0

Contacted you on behalf of my mum some while ago as she had exchanged her vouchers for boost vouchers as you were about to stop doing them. Normal vouchers last ages  but no one pointed out to my mum that boost don t. She went to buy my daughter a first birthday present with them in August  but found they d already expired. As soon as she told me I emailed you explaining. I even gave the voucher nos as she had got ¬£30 but had spent ¬£10 before expiry. She is a pensioner so every penny really does count.

On Saturday I was messed around with my shopping order  I complained and was told I would receive an apology from the duty manager either yesterday or most likely today. It s now 19:00 and still no apology. I presume an apology is something the duty manager doesn t feel is necessary.					2016-10-20T18:00:08+0000	1476986408	2016-10-20 20:00:08	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered bodysuits on Tuesday before 6pm and at the time of order on screen I was told the order would be in store by 3pm today. I didn t receive an email or text to say my item had been delivered so I went into the store on the off chance the delivery had been made  it hadn t. Your member of staff was very nice and couldn t see the order in store so he telephoned to chase  he was told there was a delay and it may be in store tomorrow  Friday. Please explain? And also  why I haven t been notified of any shipping problem. Thanks.					2016-10-20T17:06:48+0000	1476983208	2016-10-20 19:06:48	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My fitbit must have fallen off and after re-tracing my steps I went to the Customer Service desk to see if anyone had handed it in. I was seen to by Amy and although no-one had handed it in she took my details and said if it was handed in she would phone. I was gutted to say the least but such is life  got on with my shopping. Half way round the shop Amy found me and told me an amazing lady had handed it in  she initially thought it was hers as she had an identical one. She didn t leave a name or contact but she was an NHS worker  if anyone knows who it was please thank her for me. It is so good to get excellent customer service  thank you again Amy <3 <3					2016-10-20T14:15:32+0000	1476972932	2016-10-20 16:15:32	5	2	5	0	7	2	1	1	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my 16 month old daughter had just received our food when she choked on some water  she then proceeded to panic and hold her breath. I was frantic turning her upside down and hitting her back  she then took a breath and started having a coughing episode for 10 minutes whilst struggling for breath in between as she was coughing that hard. Did any of the staff come and see if me or my daughter were okay? No! My daughter then finally fell asleep on me absolutely shattered after what had happened.  As you can see on this photo  our food was barely touched and yet not one member of staff came to see if I wanted my food reheating so I could eat it whilst my daughter slept. They kept walking past me and just looking. What a waste of money.  I just can t believe none of your staff came to ask if we were okay üòì  From a tired and pregnant mama.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14729160_1784077735198474_8473746222193670681_n.jpg?oh=42a6c20d1b35339d73219d2c21d45342&oe=58E5AE5A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14729160_1784077735198474_8473746222193670681_n.jpg?oh=cde342546a4721e907246c66a54408d7&oe=591F054F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1784077735198474&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-20T13:22:31+0000	1476969751	2016-10-20 15:22:31	0	8	2	1	11	8	4	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0

I displayed my ID when asked but they refused to sell me the scratch card as I was with my mates who couldn t provide ID I received immature and sarcastic behaviour from the serving staff member. I felt this was uncalled for and extremely rude  it was like getting treated as a kid.  she also sarcastically smiled and put the thumbs up as I left the store.  After getting so worked up over this incident I decided to confront the staff member and get her name to complain about her. As I walked back into the store she tried to avoid me and tried to walk off but I just managed to see jacquie s name badge.   Once I got jacquie s name I went to leave the store as I had seen my college lecturer who asked about the incident as he could see I was wound up.   my college lecturer informed Jacquie that we would raise a complaint   Jacquie continued the poor customer service by dismissing my college lecturer and walking away saying  Do I look bothered  This left both me and my lecturer shocked and speechless!  This is by far the worst customer service ever received!  - Joe white					2016-10-20T12:57:59+0000	1476968279	2016-10-20 14:57:59	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Normally there are 16 in a box when I ve bought them in the past. As you might see  I m missing one  who went without  me or my husband? It s not really a question  obviously it was my husband. Even went to the extreme of weighing them to check... I was right. It comes to 222g just profiteroles and 288g with the sauce not matching the stated pack weight. Sad times! Even sadder times... This has happened before  I accused my husband of eating one  I now know he was telling the truth! üòÇ #feelingshortofaprofiterole #buildingthetrustback	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14656429_10155147172950616_3073399990154830051_n.jpg?oh=6f549345b83ec2e6caadbc0a5fe71eac&oe=59185B03	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14656429_10155147172950616_3073399990154830051_n.jpg?oh=807759b98997dcb51686e9f36fd2853b&oe=591C6A77	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155147172950616&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-20T12:44:12+0000	1476967452	2016-10-20 14:44:12	6	5	10	0	15	5	4	1	3	0	6	0	0	4	0	0	0

My daughter (aged 6)and I were walking through your fruit and veg aisle when my daughter spotted some grapes on the floor. She said  oh no mummy someone has dropped some grapes on the floor and that s dangerous   I said  your right darling  a tesco colleague Elaine or Irene can t remember which it was overheard and said  thanks for spotting that well done  we didn t think anymore of it. The member of staff then spotted us a few minutes later and lead us to a shelf full of toffee apples and told my daughter to choose one free of charge as a thank you for pointing out the hazard on the floor. Needless to say my daughter is over the moon  such a small gesture has made the difference from the usual boring shopping trip with mum!!					2016-10-20T10:58:20+0000	1476961100	2016-10-20 12:58:20	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just completed my weekly online shop and notice this increase.  It may not seem a lot but when your buying 4 a month it soon adds up.  I noticed a lot of increases on branded items.

I decided to save my points till Christmas and early in the year after speaking to a lady on the club card line to save my points until christmas and  asked the lady if boost would be on again nearer Christmas as just been one when I rang up.m Lady said possibly November early December so say if I had  ¬£25 in ppoints  it would double to ¬£50 which i was so chuffed about it was a godsend as pensioner with a very sick Husband in Hospital overm3 months and we nearly  lost him a few times but  he eventually came home but cannot drive as yet and I don t drive so cannot get out so rely on weekly deliveries and have done for over a year as he hasn t been well enough to drive Lady on the phone when I mentioned boostmatmChristmasmsaidmitmcomes in handy.Just placing my order for groceries again this weekend decided to see how much I had saved but imagine my horror to find you had stopped boost no email or letter when sending me food off vouchers .Imeven went over to eon to boost my points. I buy a lot from Tesco Direct also and pay so much a month for delivery saver  I rang cashcardmdept but she rang me back and said nothing she could do. I told her I was relying on the boost as religiously saved up my points and felt I had got enough to get some presents for family or at least it would go a long way  I shall not be spending ¬£60-90 weekly with you as have to get extra now hubby at home and needs different foods etc.I have to get a lot for him health wise so money is tight. I will go elsewhefe as feel totally let down by Tesco and will be going to the papers as really annoyed.Lady in phone said her Manager said it was in the Press and in store Well I said seeing as I can t shop in Store and that is why  I shop on line and don t often get a paper and I only get local paper so didn t see it And you could of sent me email or when you send me money off vouchers included it in a letter but nothing I had no idea and I have to say upset as always stayed loyal to you.Sorry to sayno more I am leaving.					2016-10-19T19:58:38+0000	1476907118	2016-10-19 21:58:38	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got a Tesco delivery order on 15th October and in it were  yoghurts for my little girl. Today she offered me some of the one she was eating and I immediately I thought they tasted funny and were unnaturally thick so checked the date. 1st October! 14 days out of date. üò° My daughter has been struggling all week with a bad stomach and now I know why! She s just eaten another tonight before I discovered it out of date. So I emailed you. And I m told I need to travel to the store they came from...which is 23 miles away from me. All for ¬£1.50. You re joking surely? I order online because I struggle to get to a store and you think this is ok? This is not my error! In addition the reply was addressed to the wrong person  and kept referring to me being ill even though I made it clear it was my daughter. There were other fundamental issues in the reply as well. Not good enough Tesco  not good enough. üò°					2016-10-19T19:36:50+0000	1476905810	2016-10-19 21:36:50	1	15	8	0	23	15	10	5	5	0	1	0	0	0	1	6	0

I have always done all of my shopping with you and feed my family weekly using yourselves  however numerous times recently I have been really disappointed with the standard of the fruit I have purchased  the strawberries have looked lovely however when tucking into them I have found them extremely mushy and tasteless  almost as if frozen and then thawed  I found this numerous times so stopped buying them. The reason I have now decided to contact you is because I have had enough now! I bought some red grapes for my son  he loves grapes  but he told me these tasted different and awful  so I tried one  I can only describe the taste as chemically  just disgusting  I can t believe my poor son had tried to eat this! I have 2 young children who I try to feed as healthy as possible so this is hugely disappointing. I look forward to hearing from you with a solution.

Still nothing resolved  Tesco are blaming their supplier. It has now been around 6 weeks since I reported the damage. Just so you know Tesco  the external light which is damaged and doesn t work is outside my front door at the top of some steps  as we re approaching winter it s getting dark earlier  my pregnant wife finishes work at 8pm. When she gets home it s already getting dark up here in Scotland. If she were to trip due to bad lighting there will be hell to pay. I suggest somebody gets this resolved ASAP					2016-10-19T14:22:13+0000	1476886933	2016-10-19 16:22:13	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just bought one item but was giving a receipt i didn t need so just left it at the machine a total waste.  So if you could program your self service machines and tills to ask the customer if they require a receipt. It could cut down on ink  paper and waste because most receipts end up in the bin. Times that by all your transactions yearly and stores thats a lot of paper and waste saved.					2016-10-19T14:06:48+0000	1476886008	2016-10-19 16:06:48	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to commend the ladies working there today. They were nothing but helpfull when it came to asking for cold water for our babies feed  and while my hubby took an important 45 minuet phone call in the car  they covered his food for him and put it under the warmer. Sat on my own the ladies also took an interest in my daughter and took the time to chat to me while doing their work. This friendly caring approach put me at easy  especially when sometimes feeding my 3 month old in a public place can be stressful at the best of times. Thank you ladies for taking the time and making that little extra effort  it goes along way. I hope this feedback gets to them  as customer service like this needs to be recognised.					2016-10-19T14:05:12+0000	1476885912	2016-10-19 16:05:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In addition a number of properties along Bitton Park Road also have them collecting outside there property.  Now all staff that come to work at the store  including the manager  will pass them on their way in  however. no effort has been made to tackle this problem.  We live in a seaside community and these gloves will find there way into the estuary via the adjacent culvert impacting the habitat of the adjacent estuary and those that depend on it for there living.  Please arange to have this issue corrected immediatly or I will contact Environmental Health (again).					2016-10-19T10:00:50+0000	1476871250	2016-10-19 12:00:50	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Shopped for essential Items as unable to go out Booked my slot for between 9 and 10pm No shopping arrives. Call the centre put on hold then told that the driver isn t answering the phone. Hang up and at 10.07pm receive a text to say my shopping is delayed and will be with me between 22.15 and  22.45 pm Shopper never arrived.10.45pm call again  on hold 18 minutes then told sorry the drivers phone is switched off. and they don t deliver after 11pm. Its not after 11pm yet I say. I ask where the drivers last delivery was and told he was at Erith at 10pm which is only 5 minutes away . ( Which is where the online shopping distribution centre is ... how suspicious... Maybe he is parked up in a layby which I ve been now told  the drivers do to waste time if their deliveries are delayed) So there is no reason why my shopping could of been delivered in the delayed time slot you gave me. Call centre staff severely lacking in manners and I do not appreciate their hard luck attitude . At no point did I ever receive a call to say my shopping would be late or wouldn t be arriving  Shopping  I m told will be with me by 5pm today. and offered ¬£20 voucher Unfortunately Tesco...

This morning at around 9.30 in the Harold Wood Essex area  I was happily pulling in to my works carpark as I do every morning when unexpectedly a Tesco van pulled in behind me. Not unusual you might think but as we don t order from Tesco I was slightly confused. The lovely driver parked in the corner of our carpark and climbed out of his van whilst I m still confused as to what he could possibly be delivering. A few moments later he gets back in the van and merrily drives off. Leaving a puddle of his urine against our fence. If he wanted to use the toilet he should have just asked. Not what you expect to see on a Wednesday morning and a very bad red representation of your staff!					2016-10-19T08:50:09+0000	1476867009	2016-10-19 10:50:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have wasted over ¬£10 in petrol making dawn raids to find some.  Today I was told it was in stock  out the back  but - on checking - there was nothing !  I was then told that no more would be in until Friday and then only SIX loaves. Given that I buy three a week  that is unbelievable !  It is hard not to get the impression that Tesco is treating Coeliacs as irritating second class customers who only need to be fed once or twice a week !!!					2016-10-19T08:15:50+0000	1476864950	2016-10-19 10:15:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The batterys have leaked everywhere ruining the majority of my battery powered appliances such as remote controls (6)  and air fresheners (3)  I have also got the battery acid on my hands which isn t a pleasant feeling. You should have these taken off your shelves immediately before someone gets seriously injured. I do not have a receipt but still have all the packaging.					2016-10-19T08:15:13+0000	1476864913	2016-10-19 10:15:13	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On complaining  I was told they WERE in stock but on checking out back  there were indeed NONE.   Even more ridiculous was that next delivery was not until Friday AND only six loaves were being delivered. Given I buy three per week  that is clearly ridiculous.  I get the distinct impression that Tesco are treating Celiacs as irritating second class customers who only need to eat occasionaly ..... a whole week without a staple diet item like this is unbelievable!!!  Very angry and frustrated ..... ¬£10 pf petrol this week to stare at shelves that should not be empty!!!					2016-10-19T07:27:24+0000	1476862044	2016-10-19 09:27:24	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I ve been shopping to your branch in Elgin and i carry my disabled 5 years old son with me inside the store thinking that you have a special push cart that i can put him into. ( the same one as what you got in your buckie branch ) but surprisingly elgin branch don t have any  i ask one of the employee in the costumer service shes very nice she said they don t have any of the special push cart  i said why they don t have it. its handy so i don t need to put my son into his wheelchair because i can only take a small basket if i put him on his wheelchair. Then the lady said they got a push cart that can attached to the wheelchair we tried it on but because my son s wheelchair still small and narrow its to dangerous coz he might bang his head on the handle of the push cart because its too close on his face. So i just decided to take make son on his wheelchair and me taking a small basket thats not really good thing considering its to hard to push a wheelchair while im carrying a heavy basket pull of things that i need and i cannot do more shopping to do with a small basket. Hopefully you can get one of that special push cart on your elgin branch. For sure it s not only my son thats been looking for one when they go shopping with there special needs kids.

Today I popped into store to get lunch for work tomorrow. I m normally quite fond of a tesco ready meal to break up a busy day. So I must admit I was rather taken a back when I saw an out of date meal on the shelf. When I asked a lady filling the selves if she knew about this she said  It s not my problem you ll have to talk to a manager  unfortunately I was to shocked at her rudeness so walked off before getting her name. I went to the customer service desk when it took approximately 10 minutes of watching two people serve one man  I use the word serve loosely  they were faffing. I then spoke to the duty manager  again forgetting to get her name. She tried to blame is mistake on the night manager and said she would need to speak to him. She was rather dismissive about the whole thing and I don t think she truly understand the consequences of selling out of date food. I understand mistakes are made and things get missed but there is no reason for rude unhelpful staff.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14650614_10155434219449698_8199264232894986004_n.jpg?oh=0643bd3178a87c2e0d24242423753d3a&oe=58ECE8CA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14650614_10155434219449698_8199264232894986004_n.jpg?oh=e613547d5c16bbf6d9b2d503f853b239&oe=58D8E1C7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155434219449698&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-18T19:09:41+0000	1476817781	2016-10-18 21:09:41	1	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

The milkfloat goes round at an ungodly hour (5.18am past my house) and in an effort to not annoy and awake every living being on its round the providers of this amazing service worked out almost 80 years ago that a quiet float is better. To that end they invented the electric milk float  which was eerily silent and  floated  around its rounds delivering it s goods and making breakfast a happy time for millions of people across this fair land.   So my question would be  why do you choose to use an old rattly transit van that sounds like an earthquake moving down the street  and with the frequent stops I get to listen it idling a few times down my street as it wakes up the sparrows. I can assure you it needs a service  or quite possibly just scrapping completely.   Whilst I appreciate it may not sound too loud during daylight hours   imagine the dead of night silence in a quiet residential area being completely and utterly shattered by what I actually thought for the first few times was an articulated lorry.   Do you have any plans to replace the cursed vehicle that wakes me every morning without fail  or should I invest in some heavy duty earplugs?    This would have been a wittier message  but the truth is I am exhausted.  Tidworth  Wiltshire.					2016-10-18T18:12:42+0000	1476814362	2016-10-18 20:12:42	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I looked closer I noticed they were bugs of some sort with legs. Completely grossed out.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14690980_10209817379287627_76619624504308015_n.jpg?oh=0343d64061acc01674c4025cc762cb02&oe=58EBC243	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14690980_10209817379287627_76619624504308015_n.jpg?oh=e32f109237e80fa7848524ed1cd3ae9d&oe=58E043BC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209817379287627&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-18T17:46:00+0000	1476812760	2016-10-18 19:46:00	2	2	3	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

It s a day out of date and this is the third problem I have had in this store  I shop in Tesco s a few times a week but this has put me off now.

But when I went yesterday my with my son when he got home he had some for his supper and was horrified to find they weren t vegetarian. The tin was almost identical to the others but they were meat. My non meat eating son had eaten them. The packaging is so similar it is a easy mistake to make and they are right next to each other in the shop. I think it would be helpful for myself and others to either have them stacked away from the meat products or with a different label so this doesn t happen again. My son was devistated.					2016-10-18T15:57:54+0000	1476806274	2016-10-18 17:57:54	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

She didn t ask for the help  he offered it right from the get go. That chap  and I m sorry  I didn t catch his name  deserves a pat on the back.

He wouldn t take no for answer because I am pregnant. He was lovely guy and actually cheered me up a bit.  That s not the end of it though! I then went on to call customer services to give some positive feedback for a change  for your advisor to top it off by thanking me with a voucher off my next shop  despite it not being your policy to reward positive feedback.  It was only a small gesture but an unexpected and very much appreciated one! So thanks to 2 members of your staff I m now back in the good mood I started my day in! I don t know the guys names but just wanted to say well done and thank you the small things can make a big difference  my husband and kids appreciate it!					2016-10-18T13:17:12+0000	1476796632	2016-10-18 15:17:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been very low lately  and last week there was a new person with the driver  a lady called joan. We had a right chat on the doorstep and when she left i thought what a lovely lady.... but nothing prepared me for todays deliver                                      The same team came and i unloaded my shop as we chatted  nothing unusual. Then from now where joan produced a gift bag  and told me she wanted me to have a pamper and a chill time as she had had tough times and knew how i was feeling..... well now im in tears because of the kindness and complete angelic act of a complete stranger. I hope tesco know how very special this lady is  and im sure anyone who is lucky enough to meet her do to.... just want to say thank you joan you are amazing.

My Dad and I fell in love with your blue and orange dyed lilies after my Mum died. I used to buy them whenever I saw them as these colours hold great significance in our lives. He died recently and I asked the funeral directors to use them in his casket spray. They have just told me that they can t source any so it s up to us to sort it out. Can you help me get hold of 6 fresh bunches of blue dyed lilies and 6 fresh bunches of orange dyed lilies on Wed next week?					2016-10-18T10:14:14+0000	1476785654	2016-10-18 12:14:14	0	10	0	0	10	10	4	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They were replaced last week with tesco own brand turkey rashers . I gave them a try even though they werethe same price as Branded turkey rashers in other supermarkets . I purchased 3 packs as my husband prefers them to bacon ....Big mistake   they were absolutely disgusting . They are clearly so full of water because they disintegrate as soon as youtouch them . As for the taste they were vile and in no way resembled turkey rashers . They have aterrible chemical taste and cook terribly . 3 packs went in the bin . Please stop replacing brands for your own label when the quality is so inferior and the price is very little difference .					2016-10-18T08:41:17+0000	1476780077	2016-10-18 10:41:17	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As yesterday whilst tucking in to my usual cinnamon delight I was overcome by a strong taste of what I can only describe as soap/ cleaning products.   I gave this unpleasant experience the benefit of the doubt  but today I ve come to eat another from the  soapy batch  of cinnamons I purchased in hope that yesterday was a fluke. Unfortunately I was wrong and now I m left with a strong taste of cleaning product in my mouth  leading me to believe that all of the pastries I bought now need throwing away.  I suppose what I wanted to do was make you aware that at some point between baking and sitting on the shelf  someone has mistakenly sprayed them and put them out for sale.

One particular time I felt a seizure coming on and in panic I notified a member of the security team who was nearby and he helped me out of my wheelchair and onto the floor   and phoned for an ambulance and stayed with me and when I came round he was very reassuring and helpful  another occasion I was sat in the cafe and I felt fine but a member of the security team was walking by and actually noticed the warning signs before I did ! He calmly advised me to lie on the floor and minutes later I was in a seizure which in my opinion and experience goes well above and beyond what is expected. I would definitely say that Tesco are good with people who have disabilities as sometimes I m in my chair and struggle to reach something off a shelf and if a member of staff is passing by they will often pick the item off the shelf for me .Thank you :)					2016-10-17T22:10:03+0000	1476742203	2016-10-18 00:10:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She felt very nervous about getting her eyes tested  we spoke about it over and over again at the weekend  trying to reassure that there is nothing to worry about. We also watched kids friendly video about the visit to optitian to ease the worries  however she started to cry uncontrollably every time we mentioned it.  When we arrived at Tesco  she hid around the corner and refused to coorporate. She was very upset and could not overcome the fear. I informed one of the member of staff ( Michelle) about the possibility that we might need to cancel our appointment. Michelle was very understanding and told us to take as much time as needed. While I was trying convince my little girl  Michelle came around the corner with a sticker and started to have a friendly chat. They both agreed to book another appointment in a weeks time. As a parent I felt so grateful and even amazed of such  friendly and understanding approach. Michelle booked new appointmen after checking a diary to make sure  her friend  will be there to meet us. She also describe her friend ( colleague) to my little girl. Additionally she offered her to see both rooms that she will need to visit on the day of her appointment. My little girl replied that she will possibly do it next time. Michelle understood that it is important for a child to feel familiar with the setting  changed her offer saying- ok  can I show mummy then? You can also come with us. She happily agreed. Michelle was very positive and friendly towards us and even allowed to test the equipment. I can not express  how much I appreciate Michelles amazing skills and kindness. My daughter was just another customer in Michelles busy day but for my daughter it changed the whole day and I believed made her a better person by showing how a complete stranger can care and support someone who is feeling scared or upset. She skipped around the shop and mentioned the lovely lady in Tesco opticians. My little girl cant wait to see Michelle s friend and get her eyes tested next week. Thank you for such a positive experience!					2016-10-17T20:08:20+0000	1476734900	2016-10-17 22:08:20	2	1	3	2	6	1	1	0	0	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

They offer fantastic support to deafblind people and I am shamefully begging you to find some kindness in your soul and donate a prize  this could be a box of chocolate  a bottle of booze  a gift voucher  hey I would accept a box of tampons at this stage (although not my first choice) you could even donate a prize for every mile I ll run?! Now there s a thought. What a fantastic way of showing the world (or the little town of Worthing) what a kind  caring company you are by donating 26.2 prizes (I ll except the box of tampons as .2) I hope I ve caught you in a generous mood. I can provide evidence from the charity if required :)					2016-10-17T19:40:49+0000	1476733249	2016-10-17 21:40:49	2	4	2	0	6	4	1	3	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I chose to use your music download service a year or so ago  on the basis that you were competitive on price and that your name meant that you would be a safe bet for the future. I was wrong.  Obviously the main selling point for using a music download service over buying CD s is that it acts as a backup if you should ever lose your music from your computer.  Well  the inevitable happened and my hard drive died  causing me to lose a large amount of music collected over the years. No  problem  I thought  I can always download it again from the various service providers that I have used. Luckily much of this was through Amazon  where I have had no problem in downloading my purchases.  When I came to get the music that I had bought through Tesco though  I found that the service no longer existed. I contacted you by email to ask what alternatives were in place to access the service I had paid for  only to be told that there were none! I was also told that you had emailed all your customers telling them that the service was being withdrawn. Well  I happen to have an email service where no emails are deleted. I went back through them and found no such emails. I am sure that if I d had an email telling  me that a service I had paid for was being withdrawn I d have been having this conversation with you then.  I am left feeling that Tesco s has ripped me off  taking a not inconsiderable amount of money for a service which  at the point of needing it  was not there.					2016-10-17T19:13:14+0000	1476731594	2016-10-17 21:13:14	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Over the last few months there have been 3 big changes within #tesco that have made me really notice and respect their marketing choices and I can now see who their target consumer is. #freefruit to children in store. #babycpr on their baby grows. #standingforthecustomer against the Unilever crisis. We are so quick to complain when a company doesn t offer or perform to standard  yet I think we also need to recognise when these large corporations start taking it down and standing next to their customers.

This is so disgusting and I will not be buying this multi pack again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14666069_10207024540001427_2298725939877471783_n.jpg?oh=05482f5a9bb36726c80d3784f5c8ee5a&oe=58DB3076	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14666069_10207024540001427_2298725939877471783_n.jpg?oh=e798df4961c2033e3da9df7b08788edd&oe=58D9137B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207024540001427&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-17T17:49:21+0000	1476726561	2016-10-17 19:49:21	0	23	1	0	24	23	8	15	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I didn t catch his name but he has an Irish accent so should be easy for a manager to pin down (not literally of course  that goes beyond the realms of professional conduct). He first caught my attention when he started singing to me and my two year old daughter...always a win in my book. He s been running up and down the parent and child parking collecting trolleys so parents didn t have to leave their children unattended at all and he s offered help to pack shopping into cars to EVERYONE he has walked by.  This man is a credit to your company.					2016-10-17T17:08:24+0000	1476724104	2016-10-17 19:08:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I currently work at Birmingham children s hospital on a specialised ward for over seven year olds! A company have very kindly agreed to help us hold a party for Halloween  we are currently in the process of preparing for Halloween but sadly have not many decorations  due to our lack of funds to buy any  our ward is looking very sparse and not very spooky üï∑üï∏üéÉ! Is there any chance Tesco can donate any decoration items that may not be being sold due to damage/ripped packaging etc? We really need some help to make our Halloween party for our long term patients very special this year!

This morning I received a parking ticket for ¬£85 from highview parking. I the run up to Christmas if you have a lot of shopping to do I would advise you give Forestfach a miss or you may find it costs you a little more than you expected.					2016-10-17T15:14:43+0000	1476717283	2016-10-17 17:14:43	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whist paying for my shopping at the self-service check-out the man next to me was just paying for his daily shopping and lunchtime meal deal. He promptly paid and left without looking back to notice he had left his lunch at the check out.   One of your members of staff came over to pick-up the abandoned lunch items and checked to see if he could see the customer who had already left. Following this  to my utter confusion  he threw the items into the trash.   As I witnessed this  confused by the utter wastefulness  I looked out of the window to see the homeless man who I pass outside your store every day salvaging through the bin for scraps of food - what a messed up world we live in!   As I m sure you re aware  homelessness is a real and devastating issue both across London and UK. Charities like Shelter are working tirelessly to try and provide maximum support with little to no funding.   Please re-think the way you contribute to the societies in which you locate your stores					2016-10-17T15:09:34+0000	1476716974	2016-10-17 17:09:34	4	6	4	0	10	6	2	4	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

After some to and fro about click and reserve and getting the item delivered  I sign for it this afternoon.   Lo and behold we open up a rather large package to find a 500GB PS4. Funny looking Lego eh?  So we ve spent ¬£33 and instead received a PS4.   Now  some might call us a pair of mugs but the conscious in our heads told us we couldn t keep it  I mean some poor employee in the warehouse is probably gonna lose their job over it right?   Call it  is there a thanks? Cheers for covering one of our employees?  Oh can you drive out of your way and drop it in a Tesco extra? (No we don t live near one). Oh well we ve spoke to a local express manager who says he ll take it.   Not fishing for likes or anything here but maybe Tesco you could learn what a proper thank you means.					2016-10-17T13:12:03+0000	1476709923	2016-10-17 15:12:03	4	7	4	0	11	7	4	3	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

My sister asked me to set up a delivery of two crates of guiness to one of her friends last week (my sister lives in malaysia and her friend lives in UK) to commemorate the birthday of one of their mutual friends who passed away nearly two years ago. Each year my sister remembers his birthday and drinks a toast to him. When the delivery man dropped off the cans of guiness and got talking to the very surprised recipient and realised what the occasion was  he very kindly phoned his manager and had ¬£12 knocked off the bill. Totally unexpected and just lovely. Thank you :-)					2016-10-17T12:02:47+0000	1476705767	2016-10-17 14:02:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It must be better quality fuel as I m sure they would have applied the Brand match. I also find so very dangerous that cars are forced to  waiting blocking Wotton Rd because only a few pumps are in service.

I took it to store last week to be told it was provided by asus and therefore their problem.... asus would collect it and look at it to see if it could be repaired.  I can t say I m Very happy about this  i am pretty sure that if a hardware fault occurs within the first 6 months it is considered to have been delivered faulty.  I am currently studying for a degree and this will effectively leave me without laptop.  I have not asked for a refund or a repair I have asked for a straight replacement.    Can you please resolve this issue.	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCIyVV34tV6hzmL&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirectuiassets%2FMerchandising%2FNonSeasonal%2Fen_GB%2Fbanners%2Fresponsive%2Ftechnology_gaming%2Ftechsupport_586x200.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQAfVPmh67avtwUO	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAy_-T4RgGNs-u3&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirectuiassets%2FMerchandising%2FNonSeasonal%2Fen_GB%2Fbanners%2Fresponsive%2Ftechnology_gaming%2Ftechsupport_586x200.jpg&_nc_hash=AQANuwvCQ6Lqqobj	http://www.tesco.com/direct/asus-e200ha-116-intel-atom-2gb-ram-32gb-emmc-gold-laptop-includes-office-365/612-1483.prd?skuId=612-1483&pageLevel=sku&sc_cmp=ppc_sh-_-sh-_-tesco-_-612-1483&gclid=CjwKEAjw7ZHABRCTr_DV4_ejvgQSJACr-YcweQyHWl0LUBsD3Pc-8FkHsG6d2Z8RaGqA8OszlS89JxoCI8rw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&source=others	tesco.com	2016-10-17T07:12:38+0000	1476688358	2016-10-17 09:12:38	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been having a much needed sort out and filing session over the past weekend to try and have a post-summer tidy up. This included filing a few Clubcard statements that had been sat on the post table for the past year(!) or so  so I only noticed this niggle today.      When doing Clubcard statements/mailings that the customer might be inclined to file or archive in some way  please can you *avoid* the use of glue-spots or strips anywhere on the mailing itself? These have a nasty tendancy to be impossible to remove from the mailing without prior knowlege of how to do this (Normally requiring a heat gun or hairdryer and a lot of patience) and tend to cause statements to stick to other documents  which makes filing a complete pig. :-o      If the use of glue could be restricted to the flap of the mailing alone (As used to be the case) this would be far better and much appreciated by many customers  especially as a gluey flap on its own is much easier to remove and dispose of separately.      Many thanks in advance for following the above recommendation. :-)					2016-10-17T00:07:07+0000	1476662827	2016-10-17 02:07:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked to speak to the manager. I explained that I wasn t able to get down some of the aisles and he said I a very aggressive town  what you can t get down any of them?  Whilst walking away from me. I was stood at the till but the only lady serving was too busy having a chat so I started using the self service till  I finished and asked the lady if the manager would be coming back  he had sat back at his desk behind the tills. He came back to me and said he was waiting for one of the staff to come  I asked why  I didn t need the staff to explain  I was reporting it to him and that he had been very rude by walking away  he shrugged his shoulders. I told him that the store was not acceptable  it is a health and safety risk and that I would be writing a compliant  he shrugged his shoulders! Yes that s right your store manager shrugged his shoulders at me! As I left the store some of the cages had been removed  these are photos of what was left.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14720566_10155106909312119_2437633176958099245_n.jpg?oh=8f0001cb56c66b3ff87bca3e40a05a1e&oe=58DF63F8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14720566_10155106909312119_2437633176958099245_n.jpg?oh=8b2393f27407a8022420af8579529329&oe=58ECE8F5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155106909312119&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-16T21:25:07+0000	1476653107	2016-10-16 23:25:07	2	10	2	0	12	9	4	5	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I spent a penny in the gents and as I was finishing to my great surprise a lady emerged from one of the cubicles. She was very apologetic for going into the wrong toilets mind you.					2016-10-16T18:47:15+0000	1476643635	2016-10-16 20:47:15	0	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

These have proven to be a very poor replacement product as they fall apart when handled  which is a real shame as we like to parcel chicken with them as one of our favourite meals. We understand this may be quite a petty complaint but we re really upset at the poor quality of this product. Have you stopped selling Mattessons in all your stores as if so  you need to consider improving the quality of your own brands. Many thanks!

My Husband and I have been doing a happy shopping at Tesco super store in Tottenham Hale (seven sisters) for the last 5 years. But today at 4:30 pm happened to bumped into two abusive staff members. After we finish the long queue for the  self check out  one of the staff members said we can t check out there because in her eyes  we have a lot of articules  and she may loses a lot of time to help us out in case the machine blocks. We explain her that we have been doing the same shopping  for the last 5 years and no one has requested such a thing before. Then she said all right. 5 minutes after she pointed her finger on us and sent some one else to make us move to a cashier. With have of our groceries already checked  he stopped the machine with the argument that our shopping was to big. They didn t even let us to finish or listen to us  just tell us to move! Was a very embarrassing and humiliating! that never happened in the 5 years we have been shopping there! We were so disappointed and thinking in no coming back to that store...					2016-10-16T17:30:47+0000	1476639047	2016-10-16 19:30:47	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He hit his head on the floor very badly and we had to rush to A&E. The staff we spoke to at the time were helpful but we could not give full details of the accident as clearly we needed to leave straightaway. We did however leave our contact details and we re told that someone would call to check on us later in the week. To date we have heard nothing  which I assume means the incident has not even been reported. We re concerned that this is an accident which has not been recorded in an appropriate manner  and wouldn t want any other parent tot go through the anguish that we had last week.					2016-10-16T16:51:57+0000	1476636717	2016-10-16 18:51:57	1	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0

How do I stand with regards to exchanging these for the sweater type cardigan which are much better value?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14657457_10154146578229220_9133896956213145317_n.jpg?oh=4b6d386b01a4bbe419ddddc0317e828c&oe=5923A376	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14657457_10154146578229220_9133896956213145317_n.jpg?oh=99e6a9b4894d53f02233df808ccc6e04&oe=58DB8C7B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154146578229220&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-16T16:37:18+0000	1476635838	2016-10-16 18:37:18	0	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0

My mother in law went in and asked to order a kettle for delivery in store (free). She had a picture and details of the kettle she wanted and they managed to order the wrong one. She s gone back in and said it s the wrong one only to be told that she ll have to order the correct one again and now pay delivery (not sure why as delivery was free the first time for collection in store) and ring a number to get the wrong one returned and a refund. This whole process took 45 mins as the staff didn t really seem to know wheat they were doing. My mother in law is in her 70 s and had all the details she needed to order the correct item and is now being inconvenienced and now also out of pocket for a mistake made by the store. I d like to know what Tesco s are going to do to put this right? üò°					2016-10-16T16:35:06+0000	1476635706	2016-10-16 18:35:06	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My Mam bought an Ella s Kitchen pouch for my 5 month old earlier today from the North Shields  Norham Road store. When I went to open it  I realised it wasn t even sealed and instead of being the usual wet consistency  it looks hard and is blocking the spout. It also smells foul and has clearly been left open for quite some time. Luckily  I noticed before even tipping it into a bowl and feeding my baby!

I went to one store and found a toy on sale but they only had a few. Went to the next closest Tesco to see if there were more. There were but the local manager and chat assistant in customer service online says as a company you do not price match your own store prices. There is a big banner on your website saying you guarantee your priceses against three other chains  but will not guarantee prices between two stores three miles apart I m the same town? For the record this was not a ¬£1 difference but at one store it is 75p and the other ¬£3... a difference of  ¬£2.25! I could buy four at one place for the price of one at the other!!!					2016-10-16T14:27:00+0000	1476628020	2016-10-16 16:27:00	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s dry and bland now but I need to eat because I m starving after waiting 40 minutes just for this.   There are hundreds of tins of beans for sale in the shop... And this tiny potato is bloody ridiculous. It s like a new potato size.  You are absolutely taking the P with this.  Will you please arrange a refund for this and for exactly the same meal my mum is eating.

The card may be faulty but it worked less than an hour before in a petrol station chip and pin.  The customer service guy gave me some line about how if you use swipe and sign instead it s open to fraud but I can t imagine many people keep a deliberately broken chip card especially so they can sign for purchases and then immediately withdraw all the money - since you only use swipe as a backup.  Swipe and sign (and even taking an impression of the card) are still valid backup systems.  If the chip and pin goes down store-wide are you going to only trade in cash and turn away all the other customers?  I bet not.					2016-10-16T12:53:02+0000	1476622382	2016-10-16 14:53:02	2	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

Conveniently I get a text message after I telephone customer services!					2016-10-16T12:02:21+0000	1476619341	2016-10-16 14:02:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The sell by date is 29th nov 2016. This juice has fermented as soon as you open the bottle it stinks. I wish to make you aware of this so other people dont buy it.

All arrived and in good order  I noticed that carrier bags were used despite me accepting not to. Then I found out why. There had been a spate of safety issues raised  mainly about entering customers  houses and that the  van-to-fridge  delivery may not always be guaranteed.  Whether this is a local issue or a nationwide issue I do not know  but the point I would like to raise is that I am a disabled person with mobility problems and rely on your delivery person to bring my weekly shopping to my kitchen. Take that away I will have no choice but to find another supplier.  KInd regards   Hazel Brewer  PS In my last job I did a stint as Safety Officer. I have noticed over the years that some of your delivery personnel double up/treble up the loads to save the number of trips from the van to indoors. Perhaps you can incorporate carrying manageable loads in your next team brief?					2016-10-16T11:13:28+0000	1476616408	2016-10-16 13:13:28	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So low and behold in no way was I surprised when I discovered these mould covered grapes in my click and collect order from yesterday! Mouldy 4 days before the date on the box  how?!

Buy the ¬£2 pack and it has approx. 10 stems.  So two ¬£2 packs you get 20 stems approx (sometimes more).  Will someone explain to me that why you buy in bulk it costs more.  Naturally this morning in Tesco I bought two ¬£2 packs and they re lovely - just do not understand Tesco logic sometimes.

I ordered my first online shop  with bags  to make it easier for me to carry to the kitchen from the front door. I was only charged 40p for adding bags So i thought I would get 8 bags at 5p each... here is a picture of all the bags I ended up with 26 in total!!!

For last 2 weeks you haven t had any and I therefore have to go to your store where surprise surprise there are more than 10 jars on the shelf.  If I am paying for the privilege of having my shopping delivered then why are you the only ones who always can t deliver something?  This morning there are 4 items that could not be delivered.

Therefore I am really annoyed and shall go back to using other supermarkets delivery where I always get what I have ordered.					2016-10-16T09:55:29+0000	1476611729	2016-10-16 11:55:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This morning I turn up at 10:10 to find they are still closed. Apparently they don t open till 10:30 now. I am now one of almost thirty people stood outside waiting all because they haven t changed their opening times sign saying they open at 10:00.

I was visiting the U.K. Last week and I popped into your Sheffield tesco metro on west street  I make a habit of stocking up on your scotch eggs and marmite for the duration of my stay. The first part of my complaint is that there was no marmite?! But the second half of the complaint is slightly more sinister. Paying with a 50 for a weeks supply of scotch eggs I was owed ¬£14.01 change. However when i left the store I noticed that this ¬£10 note had been modified into Amy Winehouse! Not only is this a nightmare for myself (I can not change it back to euros now) but it is disrespectful to Amy  The Winehouse family it is incredibly offensive to her Majesty the Queen. However  the scotch eggs were delicious and albeit fattening hehehe. I hope you can resolve my issue.  Yours  BenBen	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14721675_1240736742681793_8562021183334138189_n.jpg?oh=addacc6a458cacb7c435d3440844d62f&oe=58E74E8A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14721675_1240736742681793_8562021183334138189_n.jpg?oh=0eb5f929bf52ef454b50923e8f3c2935&oe=58D66A9F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1240736742681793&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-16T08:55:28+0000	1476608128	2016-10-16 10:55:28	40	16	62	7	85	16	12	4	31	0	40	0	0	21	0	0	0

FIreworks then woke us up at 2.45 this morning & our dog  who has a very negative reaction to them  was hugely upset. I know you cannot take responsibility to what morons decide to do once they have bought the fireworks but if they were not so readily available so early in the season us animal owners would be able to prepare our pets better....

I went into my local Tesco and ordered a 43  TV to be delivered today  I called at 6pm today too find out a rough time of delivery and was told to wait until 7pm which is their last drop time. I just called back to find out where it was as I still haven t received it to then be told at 10am this morning they couldn t find the property which is a pub and it was back at the depot! I have now been told they won t be delivering it until Monday! This isn t good enough as we have no TV and specifically picked today as delivery day and wasn t told on the first call they couldn t find the property.....which is a bright orange pub!					2016-10-15T19:09:35+0000	1476558575	2016-10-15 21:09:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to collect ¬£50 worth of toys which I purchased online for my 3 year old daughter to be told when I arrived that the items had already been collected by someone else using my name.   One of your employees went to look at the CCTV and returned to tell me I have to wait until Monday as someone is on holiday!!!   I am left without a refund or the items which I have purchased and as a result my daughter is left without her toys because apparently no one else in the store can deal with this in the managers absence.   I cannot afford to pay ¬£50 for more toys and am left now explaining to my child why she doesn t have any presents for her birthday.  This is absolutely disgusting and not the service I would expect from a company such as yourselves.					2016-10-15T19:07:00+0000	1476558420	2016-10-15 21:07:00	2	23	11	10	44	22	12	10	6	0	2	1	0	0	0	8	0

We were at the Stirling store this evening at about half 4 and saw at least 3 people park up and leave their cars or go back to their cars without children. I did not have time to report this in store  this is a regular occurance and I am sure that it is not just Stirling this happens at. It is extremely frustrating for parents/carers who need the extra space to get their children and buggies in and out üò°					2016-10-15T18:56:16+0000	1476557776	2016-10-15 20:56:16	4	6	4	0	10	6	5	1	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m 29 and she could easily be my daughter! When questioning if all adults and families with children are refused alcohol in store your answer is it s  objective . What on earth does that mean? This is the sort of rubbish I read in the newspaper and think surely it s because the customer isn t telling the full story  but nope. This is just a hopelessly pathetic policy Tesco have decided to make up to make the public feel like idiots in public when shopping. I feel sorry for the young lad who had to tell me this  because it isn t his fault but no doubt one of the many silly rules Tesco impose on their employees. I ll remember in future when I have children and want to buy alcohol to leave them tied up outside. Look out for my next post whereby a child is abducted from tesco because of their failed   objective  policies. Before you get worried  no  I won t be tieing a child up outside one of your stores whilst I go shopping. I ll just be going shopping elsewhere where these silly policies do not exist. Thanks for making my evening tesco and congratulations on losing a regular customer.					2016-10-15T17:56:25+0000	1476554185	2016-10-15 19:56:25	5	19	5	0	24	19	8	11	11	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have recently been into our local tesco on a few occasions now and I ve wanted to buy some bread  rolls  pastries and cookies what have yellow stickers on them and I ve been told I m not allowed to buy them as they are giving them to a homeless charity. Now while I think it s fantastic they are giving food away to charity instead of putting them in the bin I think the way I have been treated when asked if I can buy something on your shelves you sell isn t at all fair.  I struggle for money like lots of people do and reduced food at the end of the day really helps. I think it s brilliant if when the shop shuts they ship the food off to the food banks etc rather than chuck it in the bin but if I come into your shop to purchase something off your shelfs I should be allowed to buy them.					2016-10-15T16:00:58+0000	1476547258	2016-10-15 18:00:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been going in your stores for years and they ve been okay but I ve noticed on the news recently that you ve not been doing so well and I ve had an idea to help you revive your fortunes. My idea is Tesco..... the musical. Every store will be turned into 24 hour musical with all the staff singing and dancing whilst open  staff in costumes  themed isles and theatrical lighting  maybe celebrity appearances from time to time. A different show every week.  Feel free to roll my idea out across all stores nationwide.					2016-10-15T15:51:29+0000	1476546689	2016-10-15 17:51:29	4	2	9	1	12	2	1	1	0	0	4	0	2	3	0	0	0

We returned a faulty laptop today with a 2 year manufacturers guarantee.  The sales of goods act  (which was in force when we bought it ) states that our contract is with the retailer.  The person on the customer service desk disagreed   as did the guy on the helpline who hung up on my husband.  Can I suggest you stop selling inferior electrical goods   learn the law   or maybe we should put signs up in your stores telling customers that the guarantees are not worth the paper they are printed on.  This maybe a matter for the small claims court üò†					2016-10-15T15:33:08+0000	1476545588	2016-10-15 17:33:08	0	28	0	0	28	28	6	22	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Visited the Danes tone store and due to a mistake by a lady on checkout  who forgot to take the security tag off. As I left the store I was shout at by a security guard who clearly has no people skills yelling do you have your receipt cause something is kicking the alarm off. Embarrassed as everyone coming in or out of store heard and was staring. He got us to produce the receipt for a pair of pj s which still had tag on. I appreciate he has a job to do but he could have asked me to one back in store instead of at the door.  He left with pj s came back and just handed them to me no apology. I did mention I found him rude he just grunted and walk away. I usually shop at Asda and certainly won t be back to you store.					2016-10-15T15:31:03+0000	1476545463	2016-10-15 17:31:03	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only went in for a few bits and couldn t find any of it .... More chance of finding a needle in a hay stack... I found some glass cleaner though it was in the meat section next to a pack of poorly looking pork steaks.......ended up going to the till with some washing up liquid and after waiting 10 minutes for some lady to finish her conversation about Lilly s first birthday ....

Someone might get on Social media and comment on just how poor his driving is.  Thanks x					2016-10-15T14:37:00+0000	1476542220	2016-10-15 16:37:00	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was so much easier when it was separate. I used to buy lots of my little boys clothes from you but now it s impossible. I add items to the basket  I then have to stop shopping as he s woken from a nap or something needs doing  go back an hour later to continue shopping & the basket is empty so have to start all over again. It s driving me mad so sadly will have to stop buying from you  such a shame!					2016-10-15T13:53:39+0000	1476539619	2016-10-15 15:53:39	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I immediately brought it to the attention of a staff member who was very helpful. We walked over to the customer service desk only to be told in front of other customers that it is only a guide price as stated in t&c s and to be told the scanners hadn t been updated. This member of staff wouldn t even honor the price I had seen the items at on the scanners and kept saying its only a guide price. This has now made me change my mind about the system and will not be using again as how can I trust the price I see will be the price I pay.

So cross in fact I may throw a princess sized tantrum. However  this is an impossibility. Why I hear you ask? I have no wand!  I bought myself a Glow heart wand from your store in anticipation of being the glowiest princess at the party. Great idea right? Not so. You see I also bought two more Glow wands so I can have fellow Glow princesses. However  as we handed out the wands amongst ourselves  I had the last one.  We were discussing how they may work their glow magic when disaster struck! My fairy princess glow wand felt like it was in fact missing... the wand!  Alas I have a heart but nowhere to mount it s magic! I haven t yet opened my wand so it may be that mine is the magicest and has an invisibility spell on the wand (quite clever I do say  if this proves to be the case). I am now the grumpiest Princess at the party. Please can you advise how you intend to restore peace to the kingdom and the magic to my wand! :)					2016-10-15T13:17:53+0000	1476537473	2016-10-15 15:17:53	0	2	2	1	5	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

I bought a car DVD player from Tesco and it broke  I took it back and you replaced it for another one. This week the DVD player broke again.  My partner took it to the Aberdeen store on Thursday and explained the situation  the shop assistant phoned your head office and then came back to my partner and said okay we have refunded your money back to your card that you bought the DVD player with.  My partner said that he hadnt wanted a refund he wanted an exchange and also that the card that we had bought this with was no longer the bank that we used  the shop assistant went and called head office again and explained the situation. Head office said that because the card was under my name and not my partners if I called the next day with my new card details that they would get this sorted and paid to the correct card.  I called yesterday to be told that the payment has already been made to my old bank and there is nothing they can do about it. I apparently have to phone my old bank (which I have no details of at all as it s an old bank account and I have no paperwork for it) and try get my money back.  To make matters worse Tesco can t even give me an ANR number (I believe that s the correct name) until Monday maybe Tuesday to even try sort out this mess that Tesco have created.  I now have a very upset daughter as she has no DVD player and we have not been given our money so can t even go out and buy her a new one. I have asked for compensation and apparently even that can t be dealt with as the situation is not resolved. This would not of been a situation if Tesco had asked if we wanted an exchange or a refund rather than just decide we were getting a refund and not give us the chance to say we had changed bank details.  I am very unhappy about this and will be putting this on social media as to how Tesco have treated me.					2016-10-15T13:13:36+0000	1476537216	2016-10-15 15:13:36	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I stayed on the bike as I always do  and he got off and began to use the pump. Across the filling station came a very irate store person shouting  you have to get off  you have to get off   when she got to us she repeated  you have to get off the bike   when my husband asked why she said  its legislation its the law you cant fill your bike with a passenger on the back  (I m not a passenger I m a pillion). I explained I couldn t get off whilst the bike was being filled up  she said  well were going to stop the pump then  and proceed to move her hand in front of her throat in a slashing motion to her colleague in the store  who stopped the pump. I would like to know which law she was talking about and exactly what the legislation states. I have never been asked to get off the back before  its just easier to stay on.					2016-10-15T12:24:54+0000	1476534294	2016-10-15 14:24:54	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This makes no sense as marmite is brewed from British ingredients in Britain so is not subject to X change rates. I m sure that this applies to many other Unilever products too.					2016-10-15T12:22:50+0000	1476534170	2016-10-15 14:22:50	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I used the cashpoint outside to get money out for shopping in store  only for the cashpoint to keep my card and not give the money I had requested. When I went inside the attitude by staff made me feel even worse  one customer service assistant made a comment on how this was the second incident this morning  I asked why wasn t there a sign put on the machine to warn other users  to which the other customer service assistant shrugged her shoulders and said it s not my responsibility. The first customer service assistant added that it s not nice  but the other assistant shrugged again and said  nothing we can do . No apology or empathy  baring in mind I needed to purchase some necessities. I am now stuck with no card  can t get the shopping I needed. I must say tesco your customer service is unlike any other I have experienced to be fair. And I will not be going back to my local tesco no matter how convenient it suppose to be.					2016-10-15T10:22:31+0000	1476526951	2016-10-15 12:22:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was waiting to buy stamps. The lady in the queue ahead of me was being served at the till by a Tesco rep but having a personal conversation with a second Tesco rep who was standing at the end of the counter. I waited while the transaction completed. Then waited some more as they continued their personal conversation which was about the second Tesco reps health problems. And waited... Finally the customer ahead of me wrapped up the conversation and left so the counter was free for me approach. I took a step forward....But no. The second  rep said to the one serving that she wanted to put her stuff through the till  so (both still ignoring me) the two members of staff put her items through (2 bottles of hairspray and a packet of sandwiches). This is with the second rep leaning over the end of the counter to pass them to the serving rep. Neither of them even looked at me although it was blatantly obvious I was waiting. I waited a bit more. Finally they completed putting the rep s transaction on  stored  because she wanted to pay for it later. Finally the serving rep looks up at me. No smile  no  sorry for making you wait   nothing. I asked for the stamps. She put the transaction through without saying a word  then handed my my receipt and said  there you go  no thank you  no goodbye. It really p****d me off. Customer service in your stores is usually excellent. These two members of staff are pretty rubbish examples of that. It s not nice to feel like a nuisance for actually trying to buy something. I noted the serving lady s name tag but don t want to post it here.					2016-10-15T07:07:47+0000	1476515267	2016-10-15 09:07:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Booked a delivery slot for Friday between 8 and 11pm. Received an email at 8pm saying that my delivery had been delayed between 7 and 11.35pm. I waited until midnight and received nothing. This morning I got an email with a refund. No explanation  no apology. Phoned customer services (very understanding guy  the only good thing out of all this) who informed me that there had been a bomb scare in a tunnel and they could not reach me. What about phone/email me? You cannot keep customers waiting until midnight with no explanation. Goodbye Tesco  hello Sainsbury.

We always do our shopping in Tesco and i would hate to go to an other supermarket so it would be really good if you could have some nice vegan choccie boxes! I know you brought out other new vegan food not long ago eg. burgers in the frozen section which i love! We just need more chocolate pleeeeease :) Thank you for your reply in advance					2016-10-14T20:30:14+0000	1476477014	2016-10-14 22:30:14	1	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

Everyone from the concerned lady who interrupted her packing duties to ensure help was called  to the first aiders who examined our son  called the paramedics and stayed with us until the medical team arrived and the in-store janitors who cleaned up the mess with smile and word of encouragement  to the pharmacy staff who kindly allowed us the use of their private room and the gentleman who brought a bottle of water for my son - you were so kind and helpful to us and we appreciate all your help immensely.  We also wish to thank the retired GP who examined our son and Steve and Carly  the two paramedics who assisted us on the scene.  Our son is (almost) back to his normal self and thanks to all of you he got the help he needed.					2016-10-14T18:16:49+0000	1476469009	2016-10-14 20:16:49	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

SO  to my second point  why have you put up the cost air  yes AIR  by 150%? I ve always used the same machine at my local Hucknall Petrol Station to put air in my tires at 20p. Today I put 20p in the machine and waited for it to start. Nothing! I then noticed the sign saying it s 50p for air. 10% increase on Marmite doesn t sound so bad when you re actually getting a product for that. This is air! Dispensed by a machine that s always been there. Can you please justify a 150% increase on basically something Mother Nature provides for free?

I got some shopping which came to 32 quid and my card was declined even though I was only paid this morning. So I said to the cashier I will go get the cash from the machine outside so withdrew 40 pounds again this was declined so I went back to the cashier and told her I even showed her my bank account on my phone showing money in there but the queue was getting bigger and I could see people getting frustrated with me in the queue so I apologised gave everything back and left the shop feeling humiliated!!! When I got home I called my bank to ask why it was declined they said it wasn t the bank who declined it as the payments have both been taken from my account. They then explained it was a problem at tescos end and there is a process that has to be followed for the cash machine I have to wait 2 working days for the transaction to be reversed and for the transaction in shop it s 3 working days so now I m 72 pounds short til this happens thanks Tesco #everylittlehelps!!!

On Thursday 13th Oct I purchased two newborn pramsuits and when I got home I found one had been displayed on the wrong hanger and was the wrong size. So this morning  Friday 14th  I ve returned to Store to change it for the correct size. While in store I met three ladies from your team in the clothing department (I m sorry  I didn t catch their names) One who checked to see if any of the pramsuits were in the newborn size I wanted. (There wasn t any) Another lady that ordered the pramsuit online for me (I m picking it up tomorrow) and another lady who refunded me. All three of these ladies were so helpful. Now  it might seem like they ve not done anything out of the ordinary and that they re just  doing their job  but when it s 8am  you re heavily pregnant with twins  you re exhausted from lack of sleep  your feet are swollen so you have to waddle everywhere and all you want to do is sit down with some chocolate ~ this service  friendly chat and helpfulness means a lot. So thank you lovely ladies.					2016-10-14T08:42:16+0000	1476434536	2016-10-14 10:42:16	38	13	41	1	55	13	8	5	9	0	38	3	0	0	0	0	0

Which was actually above and beyond. I wanted to say how kind and helpful Tamara was and how she is a credit to your company. Actually all the staff in the Dorchester store are great  but I believe Tamara deserved some recognition. It s the little things that go a long way.  Every little helps   So thank you :)					2016-10-14T06:58:25+0000	1476428305	2016-10-14 08:58:25	36	10	38	3	51	10	5	5	9	0	36	2	0	0	0	0	0

Bacon looked good  nice streaky bacon or so I thought! Some kind individual in your butchers department decided to play a trick on me (I wonder if he was in a clown suit?) The top rasher looked fine then  imagine the shock when I was met with 15 rashers like this... now streaky bacon usually has a nice bacon to fat ratio but this one couldn t stand up to that. This one didn t even have a good fat to bacon ratio! Going to have to have toast instead. You have ruined my Friday! üòã	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14724345_10153892127161301_2737899469582471213_n.jpg?oh=ec88ba3dbdd0b519e9dcdd0495d34d8d&oe=58E5A029	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14724345_10153892127161301_2737899469582471213_n.jpg?oh=73876eab053e8fe159f71c15f9c80112&oe=58E4FF24	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153892127161301&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-14T06:50:59+0000	1476427859	2016-10-14 08:50:59	9	16	11	0	27	13	7	6	28	0	9	0	2	0	0	0	0

I did some shopping after I finished my shift at Clacton 5125 on Saturday the 1st of October. The amount after staff discount came to ¬£80.74. I was chatting to one of my colleagues and being distracted  removed my card a smidge too early  cancelling the transaction. Tried again  and payment went though fine. I didn t realise that the first amount had still been earmarked from my account  and the second transaction went through. I thought the amount set inside my account all this time was the second try but having just checked my account  the second try went out of my account fine on the 3rd. I ve just spoken to my bank  and they said that the amount appeared to have been cancelled at the merchants end  and that I would have to wait for it to be returned to me. I have the transaction number  but was just wondering if there is any way to get it cancelled at Tesco s end so I can get the money back. Is there anything you can do  or do I have to speak to the store manager/customer services? Thanks in advance!					2016-10-13T22:15:37+0000	1476396937	2016-10-14 00:15:37	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Service that was beyond my basic expectation. I want to give a big shout out to the home delivery lady  who upon my arrival home from work  had just finished unloading my shopping to my husband and was about to get back in her van. However  she waited for me to get out my car and said  before I drive off I just want to check you are ok with the substitution  I know your husband is but now I have seen you  I thought I would check with you as well . I was pretty impressed by this as she could easily have just waved and driven off. I then proceeded to go indoors and found my dog chomping away on a treat which my husband said the Tesco lady had given him because she always keeps some in her pocket for friendly pets. Above and beyond for me. Well done					2016-10-13T21:05:44+0000	1476392744	2016-10-13 23:05:44	5	3	5	0	8	3	1	2	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s been an incredibly tough day. The high of yesterday has completely dissipated. My excitement to find you stocking Fini Octopi was unsurpassed. This afternoon  I decided I would enjoy the sugary  jelly goodness of the eight tentacled treats. Tesco  I could have been knocked over with a feather. Luckily  I had my wits about me  despite the overwhelming sense of panic sweeping over me. This luck means I have photographic evidence of the blatant misrepresentation and fraud you are committing.

What s wrong with standing up to unilever just because they decide to get a bit greedy. If Tesco s just rolled over all of the time then we would all be paying an absolute fortune for everything. Grocery shopping is expensive as it is  without retailers putting up prices at a moments notice just because a certain supplier says so! I will be back at Tesco s tomorrow and if there is a certain something that I am unable to purchase which is a  unilever  brand then I will just try something else (Tesco brand or an alternative).					2016-10-13T19:49:23+0000	1476388163	2016-10-13 21:49:23	4	2	4	0	6	2	2	0	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was told your service level agreement with your supplier was to allow them 28 days to investigate what went wrong and the damage to my property.

Its important I feel  to let you know that I scanned as I shopped.  Long story short  just as I was nearly done Jens asked me to carry him as he was tired. Seconds later he was throwing up on me in the isle  2 shots fired.  Fortunately it seems my hood caught most of it  with the rest running down his jumper and my chest. Fortunately we somehow managed to avoid a spilage..well at least one that would have required a Tannoy announcement.  So i pushed my trolley to the toilet carrying Jens and smelling absoultely revolting. In the loo I bagged my jacket and my tshirt and Jens s jumper  handsoaped my chest  neck and his hands and face.  Thankfully I could quickly pay and be on my way. I walked gracefully and topless to the scan as you shop (SAYS) tills and scanned the barcode to upload my list.   Then I was selected for a random security check....I don t blame you Tesco but I swear to god you check me everytime!  The girl manning the SAYS walked past me with judgemental eyes  obviously not the reaction I would have hoped for when topless but still  i was aware I probably stilled stank of sick. I tried to pass her my scanner in a frenzy and explained  child  sick  me. She was having trouble with another customers security check and she soon walked back to them. Now I dont wanna complain and I know I cant justify queue jumping (or can I?) But she didnt even seem to call for an extra hand. So i stood there topless  smelling of sick waiting to get my kid home for a bath.  Definately not a long story short it seems.  Anyway I m not here to complain  I wanted to thank the gentleman that came and handed me a t-shirt. I was a bit rushed and didnt get a chance to see his name or anything  but he came over handed me a t-shirt and allowed me to gain back some of my dignity. He was wearing a Tesco jacket so I am assuming he wasnt a random handing me clothes to steal...  It was a very small and very kind gesture and I hope you identify him and give him some recognition for it  he is clearly a credit to Tesco for his customer service. Well unless what you take from this is that your staff are giving away clothes...  I was eager to get home and I was dealing with a variety of emotions  this guy made it all that little bit easier.   So thanks Tesco  thanks Tesco employee and sorry to you both if there are any unfrozen chunks in isle 2!					2016-10-13T19:10:22+0000	1476385822	2016-10-13 21:10:22	22	15	23	2	40	15	12	3	2	0	22	1	0	0	0	0	0

I have shopped with your company for over 20 years and would have liked to consider myself a customer worthy of your attention  but clearly not. It seems like many other large companies Tesco has stopped caring about there individual customers and everyday shoppers. I shop online most weeks if I can t come in to your store. I shop for a family of 5  which I m sure you can imagine means every penny counts. It is a regular occurrence on my shopping that items are missing (I contacted about this previously as on numerous occasions my alcohol was missing from my order). It is also a weekly occurrence that some of my items are substituted  which is an inconvenience but understandable. I chose not to complain when you substituted the wine I d ordered for non alcoholic wine. However this evening I am again left unhappy. I ordered 1 pack of super bock Portuguese lager 4x330ml for ¬£4. You have delivered 1 individual bottle of Chimay blue for ¬£2.49. Please explain how one bottle worth 3/4 of the price is a substitute? This is happening far too often!					2016-10-13T19:09:50+0000	1476385790	2016-10-13 21:09:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When you do click & collect they do not tell you that you need to keep the confirmation email to return the item to the store so then you have to go all the way to the post office to send if back.

I received a text to say it could be delayed by up to half and hour which was fine. I then received another text message to say it could be up to 11.05pm. With a 5am start this morning that was too late. I called in and explained this to be told they could reschedule to this evening which I was fine with. At 10pm I was just heading to bed when your driver arrived with my shopping  I thought great he has made it. He handed me my shopping apologising for some of it being wet. This was a huge understatement... at least 60% of my shopping was covered in red wine... the driver spotted this and said oh there must have been a breakage on the van ( I hadn t ordered any wine) I then had to stand and wash loads of my shopping  kitchen sides mop my floors and front step. The last thing I wanted to be doing after a long day ... I then discovered the tissues I ordered where unusable so called the call centre this evening after work. I was told that my shopping was still scheduled for this evening?????? I explained I had already had it. He said we ll you asked for it to be rescheduled and that s what they have done so again explained I thought that seeing as they delivered my shopping there was no need for another delivery..? He then advised that I would still have been charged for today s shopping??? I explained that if they have charged me again then I would be left with no money for a week. As a single working mother of four children under 7 every penny counts and I cannot cope without that money. He offered no solution other than to process the refund which will still take 5 days! He said I should have been informed another payment would be taken during my original call as this is how rescheduling works...  this was never explained to me (please listen to the call) as i wasn t  rescheduling out of choice as it was a delay caused by Tesco. I am now left with no money at all and 4 children to provide for... thanks.					2016-10-13T18:50:39+0000	1476384639	2016-10-13 20:50:39	3	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

They lost their taste when I realised that 3/4 (or 6/8 if you count both) of their large and fancy packaging is non-recyclable. Up your game  Tesco.

Shopping is not easy for any parent with young children so I m sure you can imagine it s a task for any one who s in the same situation as me. I ve just come back from America and to my surprise and joy we found these trolleys. At the moment I have to either take another adult with me or shop online. These trolleys are a life saver and make shopping less stressful. Would you please consider getting these. Trial them. I know that there are plenty of parents based in the southeast that would welcome them. One twin group I joined has 412 members!! 1 group in 1 county. Take that nationwide  that s massive.

But no supermarkets are prepared to accept an increase on the production of milk causing the producers of an  essential  food to loose their lively hood. ü§îü§î I don t think mayonnaise would go nice with my daily dish!!!

I d like for you to explain why 1  this nail is in the bag and 2 why your factory worker has been allowed to ware false nails to work?

Firstly radox shower gel now I find this shower gel to be amazing and that s just simply because on offer it s ¬£0.90 not a pound or ¬£0.99 but 90p and you gotta love a bargain  secondly you ve scrapped pot noodle??? üò° how do you expect my children to get a well balanced meal now with no pot noodle available yours are ok but without that tasty sachet of goodness the kids just won t get the same nutrition from them! I m not to fussed about the flora as it s always far to expensive with it being a margarine for the rich people ect then there is the loss of the lynx deodorant?? At a pound a can on offer this makes us feel less Chavvy because it s quite a well known brand to have on your shelf with the value soap you know! So please Tesco from a concerned customer please please reconsider your actions!

Aspirin and ibuprofen (very cheap too üòÅüñêüèΩ) After chewing three aspirin and three ibuprofen with the offending teeth the pain disappeared üò¨  Just out of curiosity why don t you stock Clove Oil?					2016-10-13T13:20:23+0000	1476364823	2016-10-13 15:20:23	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My family loves the fact that you support the British companies and farms  especially with the meat  fruit and veg  which is incredible by the way! These companies like Unilever are taking the Mickey and to be honest  I haven t found anything really that those big brands make  that Tesco don t do their own brand version of  which is just as good  if not better  and at a fraction of the price! It s a no brainer really  good bye Unilever! I am a Tesco customer through and through  and completely support your decision. Thank you for making such a difference  from things like this  to the incredible staff you have  with whom I had a 10 minute conversation sharing sloe gin recipes with one lovely checkout last! You really are the best big supermarket in the UK in our eyes (I m an Orchard Panel member too ;-) ) x					2016-10-13T12:48:55+0000	1476362935	2016-10-13 14:48:55	5	1	5	1	7	1	1	0	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I made a complaint via the form on your website about a yoghurt drink which I purchased which was A WEEK OUT OF DATE! And that is past it s use by date  not a best before  which means this is a food safety issue  not a quality issue!  You replied to me saying that you would send me a response within 24 hours....no response received yet!  Maybe it s trading standards or the EHO I should have been complaining about this to  as you clearly don t see to care!					2016-10-13T12:13:43+0000	1476360823	2016-10-13 14:13:43	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just been to Tesco supermarket at Wrekin Retail Park in Telford. Drove round for about 5 mins looking for a parent and child space. After parking  me and my husband witnessed a couple (say mid to late 60 s) with NO children park in a parent and child space. My husband approached them and asked   you do that you are parked in a parent and child s space? They are for people with kids ? The man just shrugged his shoulders. My husband then said   we just drove round for 5 mins looking for a space  he said   so what  and started walking off. My husband then said   I hope you get fined  and the man said   if I get fined  I get fined  he then walked off with his wife towards the shops on the OTHER SIDE of the retail park ! So not only did he park in parent and child space  he parked in Tesco car park when he wasn t even going there !  We reported them to the friendly staff at Customer services in store but they advised us there isn t anything they can do and unfortunately all they can do is ask them to move. The law hasn t come in yet at Tesco for people to be fined.   I took a pic of the car.  Please share this with everyone you know I want to shame these people !!  @tesco #tesco #telford #parentandchild #carparks #share					2016-10-13T12:01:33+0000	1476360093	2016-10-13 14:01:33	1	9	1	0	10	8	4	4	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am not happy with it at all.  It is faulty and Tesco customer service has washed their hands of it and passed the buck on to Lenovo customer service   Lenovo keep giving me different phone numbers to ring which is no help to me as it getting expensive (one number being a american phone number and im in the UK) and neither Tesco or Lenovo have offered me a replacement for a FAULTY product.  I find this disgusting as its still in guarantee and i have a receipt and I will never be buying a Lenovo laptop from Tesco again. I just wat a product that works.					2016-10-13T09:02:45+0000	1476349365	2016-10-13 11:02:45	0	7	0	0	7	6	3	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t have photo ID. I have no need for it- I am a 27 year old who looks 27- I don t get ID d for age restricted items. I do not drive so I don t have a drivers licence  and I ve not been abroad in nearly 10 years- so my passport is still in my maiden name and is also now out of date...I do however have the bank card which I paid for the item with  I have the order number and emails from Tesco with the barcode to be scanned. I have an out of date provisional with my photo (I ve not changed much in 10 years  it s quite obviously me) yet all of this is not enough to prove to tesco that I am the person who made the order.   I am due to collect a Hatchimal toy from your store this afternoon and messaged yesterday afternoon after finding that when you say you need identification that this means photo ID and not just the payment card and was told that no it needs to be IN DATE photographic identification.   I am still going to store (after all I ve just paid  ¬£57 for a toy my daughter is desperate for for Christmas  and which is sold out everywhere else) I will take with me the proof of identification which I have and which was acceptable for the DBS service to verify my identification last week so I could work in my daughters school. Should none of this be enough to collect the item I have bought and paid for  then I am afraid Tesco you are going to have one exceptionally angry lady in your store.   I bought some toys from The Entertainer a couple of weeks ago using their own click and collect service...all I had to do was go in there with my order email and my payment card and they gave me my goods. Why do Tesco have to be awkward!?					2016-10-13T08:52:12+0000	1476348732	2016-10-13 10:52:12	1	23	1	0	24	23	7	16	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Where do WE stand in all this? Maybe this is the opportunity to question if Britain even wants any of all that rubbish anymore. Maybe it s an opportunity to close this picture and People stand up to refuse any more poisoning.  This is not sbout boycotting. There are healthy options out there to knorr cubes  lipton tea and helmans mayonaise etc. Maybe Tesco can start stocking Ethically manufactured  organic certified  GMO-free products.  Many argue these products are more expensive  but then it is an opportunity to buy and eat what we need for our sustenance and health and not have fridges and cupboards overflowing with stuff that expires and winds up in the bin.  We do have choice. Imagine that? How lucky we are to have choice. We can choose for our health and for the planet.					2016-10-13T07:04:18+0000	1476342258	2016-10-13 09:04:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have done this before and I promised myself I d never do it again but here we are. After a long evening at the weans taekwondo/boxing/football training I found myself with an unbelievable hunger semi for your delicious  American style chocolate chip pancakes . After browsing the uncle bens Rice pouches to go with my lunch tomorrow which will consist of sticky honey chicken  baby corn & asparagus  I headed for your bakery where Pancake Patricia & Caroline Crepe usually frequent. I spotted a delicious looking pile of 6 of my favourite treats. I was particularly drawn to the 1 which resembled a big freckly arsecheek due to the amount of chocolate chips on it  so I bought them. As I got home i was so excited I realised I d forgot to bring my kids home from your shop. Buggar it I thought as I ripped open the packet. The top pancake made my knees go weak as I took my first bite. Onto the next. You can imagine my horror when I realised this particular pack of pancakes must have been made by that big  dirty chocolate chip hoarder Linda!!!! I believed she had been sacked as previous pancakes have been fantastic! This is not on Tesco! You have broken my heart too many times! Now either you get Linda that gastric band  sack her or lose my custom..... FOREVER!!!!! (Unless for bevy) I mean look at the bloody state of this Pancake! It looks embarrassed to be honest and rightly so!   Sincerely A Pancake Fan! #Linda #Pancakes #ChocolateChipWhore	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14570397_1282365218462481_8452910060704462797_n.jpg?oh=a97ff41af97250175163d813ea1f8db9&oe=58DA9030	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14570397_1282365218462481_8452910060704462797_n.jpg?oh=2972a6608c59540d2d75b588922a3665&oe=59235F25	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1282365218462481&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-12T21:28:00+0000	1476307680	2016-10-12 23:28:00	81	17	119	4	140	15	11	4	28	0	80	2	0	35	0	0	0

Do you routinely train your checkout staff to accuse customers of theft over their headsets in front of said customer without any cause to?  After visiting your Tring Road  Aylesbury store this evening I found a lovely pair of PJ bottoms in your clearance section - at 6 months pregnant its the little comforts! so whilst my other half went to check the price on a fryer (that was missing the shelf edge label) my 6 year old and I finished our shopping and headed towards the self service checkout. My other half had returned the fryer to the shelf and said how rude the checkout assistant Fozia was claiming she was unable to price check items so would have to take it to another till - Complete rubbish! We continued to the self service checkout and proceeded to scan our items  on scanning the PJ bottoms they came up as ¬£9 instead of the marked sticker ¬£5. ¬£4 difference not a major issue but still a pricing error I called for the assistant and Fozia unfortunately was the one to  assist . She looked at the sale sticker pulled it about and then over her headset loudly claimed that she had a customer at the checkouts who had changed a sale sticker and could someone confirm the price. My blood boiling at this point - being accused of tampering with sale stickers I asked to see the duty manager. Another member of checkouts arrived and exclaimed the till price was correct and again claimed the sticker had obviously been tampered with. I again calmly explained I wanted to see the duty manager  well the DM Tracey? Was apparently unavailable so Alison came over to apologise. Alison repeatedly said how sorry she was however as I m sure you can imagine by this point I wasn t going to continue my purchase purely out of principle! Is it really worth accusing and infuriating a customer over ¬£4?! I m absolutely furious at the complete lack of customer service and inability to handle a complaint in store that I ve had to resort to posting this!					2016-10-12T20:09:36+0000	1476302976	2016-10-12 22:09:36	0	5	3	0	8	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0

Why are your strawberries so expensive? I ve just bought a pack of strawberries and there are only 8 strawberries in it. You can buy a 4 pack of Mars bars for ¬£1 and the pack of 8 strawberries cost ¬£2.  Surely this can t be right? How can the government expect people to eat healthy when the supermarkets are selling the healthy foods at a much higher price than all the unhealthy stuff.  Many thanks.					2016-10-12T19:19:37+0000	1476299977	2016-10-12 21:19:37	2	7	2	0	9	3	3	0	7	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bought an exercise bike on line through the Tesco website. As stated on the site you will deliver large items to an upstairs room and even unpack the item.  Well Tesco WONT do this for me  they told me to contact the supplier which is The Sports HQ. They don t deliver upstairs and so have advised that Tesco should deliver upstairs as per the website. So now I am left with a 45kg exercise bike still in its box and unable to move it.  Ummm not good customer service üòí					2016-10-12T16:17:03+0000	1476289023	2016-10-12 18:17:03	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The groceries online has been my life line   I have a very badly disabled son and going shopping is often impossible so I rely on getting the right groceries delivered to my door..... I was disappointed when Tesco stopped the voucher double ups as I saved and used it to buy my sons Christmas present  which has often saved Christmas for us and quite frankly the triple points on days out mean nothing to us as my boy couldn t go to the theme parks etc  but that wasn t enough to make me think about moving to a different supermarket  the minimum spend of ¬£40 was also a bit of a problem as I can t now suddenly decide to get a few extras delivered when I need them when my son it too ill to go out  again I decided to stay loyal and keep going....... BUT..... in the last few months the deliveries themselves have got worse and worse..... the substitutions have become ridiculous..... (cling film instead of the tin foil I ordered)... in the last few deliveries I ve had rotten items  missing items  a whole bag full missing and I now send back more substitutes than I accept..... the customer service team are always polite and will refund when things are wrong immediately but quite frankly when I can almost guarantee there will be items wrong or missing that s no consolation when I then have to go without something I need or make arrangements for someone to sit with my son so I can then go and get them....... I pay for delivery saver but tonight I am having a delivery from Morrisons and over the next few weeks I will try Asda  Sainsbury etc and if they can give better service I feel I will have no option but to cancel it and go elsewhere.... after being a customer for 30 years that saddens me........					2016-10-12T13:53:21+0000	1476280401	2016-10-12 15:53:21	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After having asked a couple of times in store what was happening and being told to give it more time and having the same response from your customer service team  neither asked for any details   I have been dissapointed to discover from customer service today that no investigation has been carried out and it is too late to do so.

My 18 month old sliced a chunk out of his little finger on the plastic edge which I later discovered was extremely sharp with rough bits around the edges. He was in pain and today his finger is so sore it is obviously stinging him a lot! I emailed customer services yesterday saying about this and sent them photos of his finger  the pot and my till receipt  however  I received what I feel to be an unsatisfactory response this morning asking me to go into the store and fill in a form! I will attach a screenshot of my message and the photos and look forward to hearing back from you. Not very happy as my littlun has been unwell and was on the mend  yet today is so miserable and tearful and keeps holding up his finger. Poor little guy.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14657360_10154435097145631_5733757799375683958_n.jpg?oh=8a16fab51918f44e81499f462d1a4fe6&oe=58EDC4EF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14657360_10154435097145631_5733757799375683958_n.jpg?oh=3ee8c7aed03842fb4d2584dc095a7333&oe=58E334E2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154435097145631&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-12T12:22:24+0000	1476274944	2016-10-12 14:22:24	0	10	0	0	10	10	8	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

How wrong was I? More or less everything that is on offer especially in the meat and cleaning products is  currently unavailable  Why is this? As a mother to four children  budgeting is paramount. Really hope you get this sorted asap otherwise I m sure I won t be the only person to be shopping elsewhere.					2016-10-12T10:34:00+0000	1476268440	2016-10-12 12:34:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Considering she took at least 20 mins scanning the same item at self checkout because she didn t want to get it wrong  all whilst my children my youngest being 5 months was getting very impatient being that it was meant to be a quick 5 minute stop in here.  Came to the point she was getting very frustrated with us because we had to explain she was scanning the same item 3 times to then go ahead and shout in front of customers and staff  THIS IS MY PROBLEM WITH YOU PEOPLE  to which I asked what she meant by this for her to then say quietly to me  what you want to say something now  for me to ask her again what does she mean by her phrase  YOU PEOPLE  (in my eyes a very racist remark) to which she then shouted again in front of everyone  SHUT YOUR MOUTH  and enticing me to fight her! To which I got very upset and angry to the point I kept saying if I said what you said I would be wrong so what makes you right? My point is I got told it was best I left the store (this is my local and I use it everyday) nobody came and asked if me or my partner were okay  the manager was there and did nothing the stuff did nothing! I m very upset that your staff can behave like this and no consequences happen to them it s very disappointing. I feel very much let down by you Tescos. Not sure I would approve of having staff like this work for me on a major area as it is.					2016-10-12T10:31:08+0000	1476268268	2016-10-12 12:31:08	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got them home and opened them up and the smell coming off them was horrific! There is no was way that myself or my two toddlers would not have been ill from eating them. It was that bad that I couldn t even have them in the house! I am messaging as there was a whole fridge of these on display and if any others are like the ones we have had then there could be lots of problems with lots of customers! Can you make sure this is checked out?					2016-10-12T10:26:14+0000	1476267974	2016-10-12 12:26:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So those families that buy Value  on Benefits etc they have to spend this to get your service. Disgusting! ¬£25 i can understand but ¬£40 is actually alot to some people who reply on your service.

I have just decanted both packets to find lots of white chalk like sediments scattered throughout both entire packs. I can only think that it is damp/mound preventing product supposed to be consealed in the packaging somewhere  however  this incident has left us unable to use both packets as it s scattered throughout. They vary in size and shape and can imagine very uncomfortable and unsafe for my 10 month old. Thank you.					2016-10-12T09:12:58+0000	1476263578	2016-10-12 11:12:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On the 30th September i had so many problems on your direct site it was unreal. I was trying to order some xmas presents for my girls and i wanted to use my clubcard vouchers. Well that never happened. Basically my clubcard vouchers were used as your site went down. I called to query and was told tbey would be reactivated. That never happened. At 6pm i called back to be told they hadnt been reactivated and they woule do it and call me back. Then i checked my bank and in fact tescos had taken money from my account without anything being ordered. When your customer service representative called me back i explained all of this. He couldnt understand either why money had been taken yet there was no order. Eventually he told me that my vouchers could not be reactivated and to order the items i would need to pay by card  promising me that the money would be refunded as well as the money that had been taken from my account.  Well that hasnt happened so in effect i have paid twice for my order. Not actually sure how you sleep at night knowing you are doing this to people. I have 8 children  every penny counts to me and you have done this. I have always been a loyal customer of tesco well i wont be now. My mum has worked for tesco for 30 years. Frankly if this is how you treat your staff and customers i would rather go elsewhere					2016-10-12T09:05:25+0000	1476263125	2016-10-12 11:05:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

May I suggest that the Child and Parent bays be changed to Elderly bays accompanied by Parent and Infant bays  with the creation of new Child and Parent bays farther from the entrance doors with safe walking routes promoting healthy eating / exercise for young people? You then take the  app  to be issued to staff and make that public  donating all proceeds to schemes to encourage health and fight the rise in type II diabetes in kids.   After all  every little helps... #littlethings					2016-10-12T06:32:20+0000	1476253940	2016-10-12 08:32:20	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We came to our nearest store at the weekend after being unsuccessful in a so called upmarket store where their range was let s just say poor!! On seeing your range and what was to offer we tried the chicken and chorizo paella with chunky fries followed by profiteroles washed down with some non alcoholic drink. It was really tasty and we shall be eating from your two for ten pounds range again. Absolutely great for when you want to treat yourselves but trying to save some pennies(new house taking all oursüò¢) üòÄüëçüèª					2016-10-11T20:04:51+0000	1476216291	2016-10-11 22:04:51	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have spent thousands over the years. I have just renewed my Tesco car insurance for the second time with the same details. What I do not understand is why I have just been charged an additional ¬£88 and ¬£20 administration fee? It was not explained by Ross and he refused to send the documents requested out to us. He also refused to log a complaint.  I do not understand why at the time of purchasing my car insurance this was not raised  having reported very minor incidents with Tesco previously and not claimed due to the fact they were so minor I am now left with a bill of ¬£100. I really need a clear explanation as to why this has happened. You already had all my details and everything that I had previously reported. The online price was the same as the automatic renewal price and the email was the same/ address was the same. Please refund as soon as you can.					2016-10-11T19:49:04+0000	1476215344	2016-10-11 21:49:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was very heartened to see the sign in the attached photo displayed on the wall of the store facing the car park.  I am not sure whether this is a local initiative or all Tesco s have adopted this approach nationally. Being a dog lover  I have posted the photo on my own timeline and my friends all agree this is terrific and are hoping other major stores will follow suit.   Thank you for taking the issue of irresponsible owners who thoughtlessly leave their dogs in hot cars to die in some cases so seriously.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14721614_10154566623746069_281811260034436516_n.jpg?oh=f7f826a081fc381e00acc2a9a4f45d52&oe=58D853BF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/14721614_10154566623746069_281811260034436516_n.jpg?oh=1a4464c28df70323c73cd58bc840226f&oe=58DE6E31	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154566623746069&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-11T19:36:11+0000	1476214571	2016-10-11 21:36:11	8	7	9	0	16	6	2	4	6	0	8	1	0	0	0	0	0

Following a recent op  as I can not drive had a home delivery (and set up delivery saver). I ordered an S card - well the picture showed a SD card  but they delivered a flash drive and told me that is what was on the order  - which will NOT fit in my camera.  Then as we are unpacking the bottle of organic milk (4pt) we found a split in it at the bottom.   I can not get to the store to return the item (cost more in fuel than it  s worth if I could drive...) Tried phoning customer services and they are so busy I gave up on the hold....

I usually brush off any issues without protest  after all no one is perfect. Today  however  is different. I am ill  I am whiney and all I could think of enjoying for tea was a can of rice pudding. My husband wandered off to Tesco to buy me a tin of my fave comfort food and came back with it  poured it into a bowl to find that it appeared to have been replaced with soup! Upon fishing about it appeared there WERE indeed some grains of rice in it  but not the usual bounty and certainly nothing like the pictured creamy  delicious looking spoonful on the can.   As I am ill  and whiney  I decided that I couldn t face eating it and whilst my loving husband gleefully skipped back to the shop to pick up a can of Ambrosia rice pudding I weighed it out.   I m sure there must have been some oversight in the planning stages. This is a 400g can of rice pudding  which weighs in at 380g. 121g of it was rice which means the other 259g of it was  creamy  goodness. I m going to admit  this is rather disappointing  but I m willing to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that you can t actively be marketing your Tesco creamed rice pudding as such but actually giving people sweet rice soup  and this must be some issue that has slipped through your usually good quality control.  I m not asking for a refund but I d love to have some clarification  is the 121g of rice actually what is intended to be in the can or IS it an oversight please?  Sorry to be whiney  but as I have stated  I AM ill!  Pic posted is the weigh in in total  I ll pop a picture in the comments of rice weight  and also another of what ambrosia rice looks like  I forgot to get a phot of the Tesco creamed rice pudding in the bowl but if you imagine the creamy liquid in the jar in a bowl instead  with a sprinkling of floating lumps  you ll get the picture...  thank you!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14610932_10154081938872098_8548198483345937245_n.jpg?oh=61e9cab81ca04eb7c9c482f501da2533&oe=591E38AE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14610932_10154081938872098_8548198483345937245_n.jpg?oh=e5529cacd20eea864ec8a45f12cca0ad&oe=591AE3DA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154081938872098&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-11T19:09:14+0000	1476212954	2016-10-11 21:09:14	3	10	3	1	14	10	3	7	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

For finally enforcing designated parent and child and disabled bays. For too long we ve watched able bodied people and people without children abuse these extremely beneficial spaces. We know that you won t be able to catch all of the offenders  but some is better than none. Eventually  the word will spread that if you park in one of these bays without good reason  a fine will follow. And if they continue to park unlawfully  then the fines will pay for additional spaces and monitoring. It s a win-win scenario in my book!!

I assume around 8pm you reduce your stock to pennies and it invites a groups of people that stand by the doors that you bring the stock out. I have seen this a couple of times now. I was nearly knocked flying when staff brought the bread out.....Tesco need to reduce the stock during the day to allow your loyal shoppers some discount and not attract customers who only want your cheap stock only. I probably spent more than them customers put together but I won t shop in such a awful environment anymore. Why allow this to happen in your store  giving it to the homeless would be a better idea!					2016-10-11T16:17:33+0000	1476202653	2016-10-11 18:17:33	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon taking my mobile phone contract out I was sold phone insurance. I was advised that I would be covered for loss  damage etc and there would be an excess fee but if there was a fault with the phone there would be no would be no fee. This was the same with a previous provider and so it was never queried and I never checked the small print of the terms and conditions. In hindsight I should never have trusted his word of mouth! My phone has had a few issues over the course of the contract but nothing to require a new device. On Monday of last week my screen went red and then black with white lines. It hadn t been dropped  wet or damaged in any way. I was without internet and phone access until the following day when I called one of your stores. They advised me I would need to contact the insurance team as i have insurance. I spoke to them and was advised for a replacement device it would be a charge of ¬£85.00 due to the excess fee. This is not what I was told when I took out the policy nor is it a process I ve ever known before. I was disgusted as I don t have that money spare but  due to needing a phone for cases of emergencies with school etc  I paid it and requested a call from a complaints manager. I was told they would contact me on Thursday 6th October  the day after the new phone would be delivered. Today I still hadn t received a call and so rang the insurance team again. I got a very rude member of staff who  after reading the notes on the file  asked if I had received a letter advising my complaint was not upheld!! I hadn t actually made a complaint at this time  merely asked to speak to the complaints team. I asked to speak to the complaints team again and she advised me that they don t take calls!!! They read the file and then can take up to 7 weeks to respond. After working for a large corporate firm I know the complaints process and advised the 8 weeks is the ombudsman said timeframe to resolve complaints....not a timeframe to call customers to discuss the matter. She then said that a letter had been sent last night to me advising of the outcome and if I wanted to appeal it to speak to the ombudsman. I asked for an emailed copy whilst I was on the phone and she said she would do this and then came back to state that she wouldn t there and then but that I would have it within an hour. It still hasn t been received. I asked to speak to her manager but was told he wouldn t take the call as a letter had been sent. This is absolutely appalling customer service. I have the times of calls  names of staff and notes of what has been said. I will be making a formal complaint to the ombudsman. Upon my contract ending I will be leaving Tesco mobile. I was conned into an insurance policy and now I m being lied to by staff and not having any remote resolution being offered. To top this all off  there is a fault with the replacement phone to which I m told I have 24 months warranty so it can be fixed free of charge but was only given a 12month warranty with the initial handset. Ridiculous!!!! I used to think that Tesco looked after their customers but this is clearly not the case. This has really upset me and feel I ve been lied to and ignored!!!!					2016-10-11T16:14:25+0000	1476202465	2016-10-11 18:14:25	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After finishing our shop we were told by the check out assistant that if we had been parked for longer than 3 hours we will be fined ¬£70. Absolutely no clear signs around the car park advising of this new rule  just steps on how to pay for your parking. If you can t be bothered to put up clear signs advising your customers of this then you have no right in fining them. Do have photos of the signs if you need them as I think you re just trying to scam your customers and your parking marshal agreed with this too. Can you look into this please!					2016-10-11T13:34:29+0000	1476192869	2016-10-11 15:34:29	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I appreciate that some stores are the victims of theft and I can understand that your make up counter would be a important area for security measures  but to have a sign saying I have to ring a bell for someone to come and unlock the counter so I can purchase some make up  and then to be stood there for 25 minutes for anyone to come and help is RIDICULOUS!   I stood there for 10 minutes ringing this bell and no on came  I walked to the customer service desk where they made an announcement for someone to attend and still no one! By this point there was 4 customers there stood waiting with me. I walk into the centre isle to find 3 managers standing there having a conversation. I asked one of them for help to be told that she would find someone  and then to fob me off saying that the bell was not working  they WERE working as I could hear them ringing when I was continuously pressing It over and over again.  She then went off to get someone  5 minutes later she comes back with a man who unlocks the counters whilst they were laughing and joking  I didn t find it funny at all. Then under supervision I was then watched whilst they rushed me to pick my make up and then ordered to put it in a security box (which wasn t an issue).   I then went to the self service till to find I then again had to wait a further 10 minutes whilst the lady covering these tills was chatting away with another colleague and cooing over a baby. Not watching the tills at all  and I couldn t scan the make up I wanted because it was all in a box.   A simple quick 10 minute trip to Tesco turned into a 40 minute nightmare. The level of service that store did to help me was disgusting; they have no respect for there customers at all  and quite frankly I won t be going back there if I need something in a rush. Utter joke!!					2016-10-11T12:09:49+0000	1476187789	2016-10-11 14:09:49	0	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I was in the store earlier today with  my 2 year old daughter when she accidently  ran into the metal shelf at one of the end displays in store busting her lip open. As soon as the staff in store saw her they were super helpful getting her ice and cleaning the cut  all the while talking to her to keep her calm. I left the store with one happy wee girl (all be with a very sore lip) but a new Peppa pig toy and top (as hers was covered in blood).

The first time  about a year ago  I bought some food items for my dinner only to get them home and find they were 2 months out of date. Of course when I complained  they couldn t give a flying üí©. Complained a couple of months ago about out of date milk too and a short shelf life on the Tesco Pure milk (which should have about a month on it!!). The milk incident was highlighted to the Deputy Manager  Wayne  both times who doesn t seem to give 2 üí© either. The bananas are bruised to within an inch of their life  and that s when they actually have any left... this store is an embarrassment  very sloppy indeed and could do with smartening up. Is it really so hard to empty the bin overflowing right outside the door??? It s VILE!!! üò∑					2016-10-11T11:21:32+0000	1476184892	2016-10-11 13:21:32	0	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It is not due to go out of date until the 28th of October and so it should still be well within use.   I have no idea how this could happen - if it is a manufacturer problem or a storage problem etc?

On Sunday I was shopping with my family in your Taunton store minding my own business when one of your staff in an electric wheelchair ran over the back of my foot  she then proceeded to stay there until I told her she needed to reverse off my foot  which she did then she rode off mumbling under her breath  she did not even stop to ask if I was ok. As you can imagine with the weight of her and the wheelchair on the back of my foot I wasn t ok and hobbled around the store until it was so bad I went to your customer services department to report it in the accident book. At customer services the staff member called a manager and laughed as she told him I had been run over  when he arrived he wasn t very sympathetic he handed me a phone to report my accident and then when finished handed me the cheapest bunch of flowers he found in his display saying I hope these make you feel better  well they didn t. I was told someone would ring to check on me on Monday  I never received a phone call from anyone. I could not drive all of Sunday and was still hobbling yesterday.   I m all for employing people with all disabilities but that has to come with some health and safety in mind  she was clearly going to fast for such a busy day instore. The level of customer care I received on the day and since the incident has been poor to put it mildly.					2016-10-11T11:00:45+0000	1476183645	2016-10-11 13:00:45	1	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Usually I really quite like you  but on Saturday you left us cold and disappointed. We ordered a fire pit on Friday morning as your website promised it would arrive at our local store on the Saturday. The email didn t say we  might  be able to pick up our crucial element of garden warmth on Saturday - it said we  can  - which is far more promising  I am sure you d agree! We had guests travelling four and a half hours up to see us  for this weekend just gone. We went out for the day Saturday  and swung by your place at 7 o clock to claim our already paid for outdoor heating system  only to be told it wasn t going to arrive after all - and the next delivery would be Monday. Our friends left on Sunday  Tesco. SUNDAY. We were cold. They were cold. No one likes to be cold. :-( We planned on swanning around in our bikinis just because we could - knowing we would be safe from goosebumps in the blanket of high temperature the fire pit would provide us. I am sad  because apart from my terrible lack of prior planning and allowance for mistakes  this is otherwise utterly your fault. **sighs**					2016-10-11T10:32:52+0000	1476181972	2016-10-11 12:32:52	1	5	1	0	6	5	4	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Late Saturday afternoon I attended the Lowestoft Tesco store with my daughter to do a bit of shopping later that night I realise I had left my card at the store I rang and they told me to collect as soon as possible I replied that I would as soon as I can but would be in the next few days. On Sunday my daughter was poorly so couldn t leave home Monday my car was at the garage so couldn t get to the store  on Tuesday morning I arrive at the store to be told my card had been cut up as they hold them no longer than 48 hours if I had known this previously I would of tried my best to come sooner or made other arrangements but I don t just live down the road I live 4 miles away if I wanted I could shop at Morrisons which is down the road from me but I don t I choose to shop at Tesco. As you can imagine this is very inconvenient and very annoying if it was made clear they don t hold lost cards longer than 48 hours then this upset could of been avoided.					2016-10-11T10:17:09+0000	1476181029	2016-10-11 12:17:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are a registered charity in East Ayrshire  Scotland and we regularly purchase baby clothes from your online store for our Baby Starter Packs  which we give out free to families in our area.  We placed an order on the 4th October online and was advised that it would be ready for collection in store on the 5th October.  We went to the Kilmarnock store to pick up our order only to be told that it would be in later that day.    We decided to leave it a day or two so it would definitely arrive  and went back to the store on the 10th October and we were informed that the order couldn t be found.  The assistant telephoned Tesco Direct to speak to them on our behalf and was on the phone to them for over half an hour trying to find out what happened.  We were then advised that the order had been lost and we were asked if we would like to re -order which we agreed to. The member of staff at Tesco Direct had to place the order manually which took another 10 minutes.    Once the order was placed  we were then advised that half of our requested items were out of stock.  Since your clothing F&F line amalgamated with Tesco Direct we have had lots of issues.  Ordering online has become difficult and it takes time to work out what is in stock and what isn t.    As a charity we are always looking for cost effective clothing for babies and are keen to purchase your items and feel that these should be clearly advertised. It is difficult to identify whether clothing suppliers such as Mothercare are being offered as a first choice rather than an affordable brand such as F&F.  As a charity  we value our time and money and if these issues are not resolved  we will have no other option but to use another store.   We look forward to hearing from you.

This morning around 9.10 I pop into my local tesco to see what I could make for my children dinner after a while I decided on potatoes since I had chicken already on my way to the till point I was  tempted by some nuts I took a pack of peanuts and one pack of cashew nuts and some green beans once I reach to the till point I started to scan my items I noticed one of the sales assistant  telling his colleague to come and look what I was doing I paid this no mind as a black person sometimes unfortunately we do get some stereotypes  shallow minded people. Upon scanning the potatoes I realised that they where quite expensive for there was in the package so I decided I m only purchasing one I also bought a loaf of bread and some beans and left behind a packet of nuts and one packet of potato after i left the store i decided to go on the other side of the road where there was a Waitrose so I decided to have a look in there to see if it would meet my needs a bit better I found the items I needed at a cheaper price and more volume so I decided to return the potatoes that I purchased but upon me arriving in store because of the customer assistance behaviour I decided to return everything that I purchased earlier I was greeted with bad manners and attitude which later lead to a verbal altercation with one the staff while he was Taking Back the product to the shelf he made a remarks no one tell you lots to be theifts anyway this really annoyed me and I went on to make a complaint to a store manager and told him his stuff need to apologise because not only did I not put anything my bad that I didn t pay for I did not leave the store without paying for what items I have taken so therefore his staff was rude and accusing me of wrongdoing and I won t stand for it as I m also a manager at Marks and Spencer and I can tell you that there is no way under this heaven that staff could ever deal with a customer like that after speaking to customer service the guy was vaguely and said to me  if I ve spoken to a manager what do I expect him to do. this is not how tesco should do with their customers because your customer is who keeps your business running without your customer you will meet the same end as a lot of these high  street chains . I urge tesco to deal with there customers better as you have just lost a loyal customer to the Waitrose next door.					2016-10-11T09:48:01+0000	1476179281	2016-10-11 11:48:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is the second incident in a matter of weeks and it is totally unacceptable that your drivers have blatant disregard for basic road safety!!!!! My neighbour contacted you when the first incident happened and your driver nearly hit his very disabled wife as she was leaving the car!!! As such a big company you would think all your drivers would respect the law as this is not a good advert for a friendly family company. May I also point out the one way system was installed as a member of the public was killed on that stretch of road!!!!! If you could please contact me asap. The incident happened 9.25am 11/10/2016 on Meadow Way  Jaywick  Clacton on sea  Essex  co152hp This needs to be investigated and the driver reprimanded.					2016-10-11T09:11:25+0000	1476177085	2016-10-11 11:11:25	1	11	1	3	15	11	6	5	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My card was declined for fuel for some reason and I was told I have to walk to the cash point right up by tesco bearing in mind it was 8am in the morning  freezing cold and I had a baby & a toddler with me with no pram or a bag or anything! I then got a doggish look and deathly stare from both staff members because I didn t know the make of my car. Yes obviously I knew it but I was shocked and on the spot and just couldn t think my mind had gone blank! I was spoken to in such a rude manner and then filled out a police form so I could leave to get money from home. Seriously why couldn t they have just given me the forms to start with as it was obvious I couldn t do anything whilst there!					2016-10-11T07:56:55+0000	1476172615	2016-10-11 09:56:55	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently tried to apply for a Tesco job  I got asked 4 questions  now I hadnt sent a CV or anything else  just got asked these 4 question; which were; do you consider yourself to have a disability: no  do you have the right to work within the uk: yes  are you under the age of 18: no  and lastly which community do you consider yourself to be a part of: Protestant. Those were the ONLY 4 questions I got asked and answered and i got a message back saying Sorry you were unsuccessful and have not met the conditions of our screening process. So going by that the only thing I can gather is you want employees under the age of 18 and NOT from the protestant community!? Would Tesco care to comment on this as if that s the case it is DISGUSTING and WRONG!!					2016-10-10T21:56:06+0000	1476136566	2016-10-10 23:56:06	2	12	2	0	14	12	5	7	15	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered several toys last week in a single transaction online  for me to collect from store. They were bought to as Father Christmas gifts for my twin daughters and the main present they ve asked for is a baby Annabelle doll each. I decided to collect from a store that isn t necessarily close to where I live but a town that a needed to go to for other reasons so I could run all my errands on the same day. This store is otherwise a 30min car journey out of my way. I received two separate emails to say that all of my items had been delivered to the store but it was clear they had been dispatched to the store in two deliveries - hence receiving two emails. I went to collect the toys and throughly checked that all toys fell under the same order number (which they did) and the shop assistant checked that all the parcels were all of those listed (which they were). As they were all in boxes and silver bags I couldn t see the items when collected but trusted the assistant and Tesco that the order would be correct. Whilst my daughters were still in school on this day that I happened to have off work  I took the parcels to my mums house ready to leave the toys there until Father Christmas could take credit for them. I opened them all  and I only had one baby Annabelle doll - I had definitely ordered and paid for two! The next morning I called The Tesco store I collected from and nobody on the clock and collect counter answered so my call went through to a call centre line instead. I told the story to the other person and I said it is likely the doll was left in the store room and not brought out  or it hasn t been sent along with the other doll by the depot. They said they would need to have someone at the store check so I specifically said they hadn t answered my call and I wasn t willing to wait on the phone for an unknown length of time because I was busy that day  so they said they would call the store themselves to check and call me back. I still have not received this phone call. That day I was fortunate enough to be able to make a trip to that store again 30mins form where I live before my daughters finished school. I again had to explain the situation and a new assistant checked the store room. No doll. The manager came out and was very friendly but he had no answers for me so took down my number and said he would investigate and call me back. A couple of hours later I had a call from another store assistant to say they had another doll there if I wanted to collect it. My response was that I wasn t willling to make a second trip that I shouldn t have had to have taken after already doing one earlier that day  and i preferred that it was delivered. I was especially unable to go to the store with my daughters as it was to collect their Christmas present! The manager again called back later and was more helpful explaining that the depot had forgotten to send the second doll with the other deliveries but they had one in stock and offered to deliver it - but it would only be next time one of their .com vans was coming our way and he wouldn t know the schedules until today (Monday). Fortunately my husband is off work this week  but he didn t want to be waiting in the house all week waiting to see if the doll got delivered or not  especially if it arrived when our daughters were at home. He therefore had to go back instore to collect the doll. 4 separate trips we made between us to collect these toys  it should have only taken one trip! Each journey was a 25 mile round trip  we therefore drove 75 miles for 1.5hrs unnecessarily! Absolute nothing has been offered to us to compensate the trouble we endured. We are only glad that we had time off work over the last week to make sure we could get it! Tesco call centre still haven t called us back as promised but luckily we resolved the problem ourselves. We had hoped that their phone call might have saved us from doing all that driving but after being told those dolls are out of stock online now we had desperately make sure that we got the other doll so both daughters had one for Christmas - it was already paid for! We also felt that one of the assistants in store didn t believe that we didn t have the other doll - like we were lying or hadn t checked properly. I said they could check CCTV if needs be. We shouldn t had to go to those lengths to get the items I had ordered and already paid for. We were lied to and fobbed off and had to really go out of our way to fix the problem caused by Tesco. Not impressed.					2016-10-10T20:32:30+0000	1476131550	2016-10-10 22:32:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I also read you are going to fine people for parking in parent and child bays too  although some people do take advantage  ive noticed your signs state you can only park there if your child is 5 years and under. However have you considered that some parents may park in the parent and child bays because they have a child  who has a hidden disability or a condition that doesn t qualify for a disabled blue badge. I my self am guilty  i park in a child bay even though it says for children 5 and under. My child is 9 and has disability s but doesn t qualify for a mobility blue badge. When my child is having a melt down or kicking off i appreciate the wider bays purely for the safety of my son and also so he doesn t damage other cars. He isn t naughty and his behavior is not down to bad parenting its due to his condition. I think its unfair you assume once your child is out of a baby car seat the space is no longer needed. Have you considered making bays wider for parents with children under the age of 16. Not necessarily near the front of the store but somewhere within the main car park its self? Children and Adults with hidden disabilities should not be discriminated against. Yours Sincerely  A Parent with a Child who has Hidden Disabilities.					2016-10-10T20:01:35+0000	1476129695	2016-10-10 22:01:35	1	2	1	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I m trying to find bread that has no soya.  So I m looking at your I store baked breads and the only allergen or lists is wheat. I m like great  that was easy. But then I think  No. That s too easy  So a after scouring the store for a tesco person  I finally find a guy in fruit and veg. Poor guy being a fruit and veg guy has no idea if the wholemeal sliced I m hopefully carrying contains soya so he trots off to find someone.  When he does its someone who is obvs off duty cos they are in a coat ect. This poor guy has no idea either  but tells my fruit and veg guy to go downstairs and ask at the bakery. So off he goes to ask with my hoped for loaf of bread  and asks if the bread contains soya.  Which it does. I thank the poor guy and head slowly to the free from section.  So here is my question.  The labels are obvs printed for each item And it obvs has room for allergens cos it states  contains wheat  so why does it not contain a full list of allergens including soya which is in bold on most other items because it s an allergen? It s four letters. Less letters than wheat and would have easily fit on the same line as  contains wheat  there would even be room for a comma. And a full stop. I mean you d going if you can put one on then you could fit the whole list....you know?					2016-10-10T19:45:32+0000	1476128732	2016-10-10 21:45:32	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Obviously I agree I did wrong parking in a disabled space(sorry my 4 year old had a poorly belly)  however the amount of parent to child spaces is a joke ¬£70 fine. I m sure u dont monitor child spaces like that....					2016-10-10T19:40:24+0000	1476128424	2016-10-10 21:40:24	0	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Did our usual weekly shop with shop and scan. When we got to the till the scanner broke and wouldn t download   which meant we had to go through a normal till and unpack the shopping we had already packed as we had gone round.  The lovely lady from the shop and scan found us an empty till and help was offered to unpack and re pack the shopping - all the staff were really helpful.  We were even given a box of chocolates for the inconvenience. Great customer service xx					2016-10-10T19:01:01+0000	1476126061	2016-10-10 21:01:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can t spot it....... I ll tell you shall I?  This product has apparently been  approved by Mums    I m sorry but do children not have Dads?   Maybe in the world of Tesco Dads aren t capable of approving bath products for their children?  I dunno? Maybe I m the only Dad that buys products and uses them when bathing the kids?  Maybe my wife and I don t jointly discuss what s good for the kids and my wife teleports back to the 1950 s  to  approve  your products.   Psssst. Has anyone told you that some kids have 2 Dads!

Clacton has not got bigger than Ipswich but it has now got an ASDA so I think it was a lack of competition thing not supply and demand as you had previously stated. As I thought profiteering while you had no competition welcome ASDA to Clacton.					2016-10-10T18:37:52+0000	1476124672	2016-10-10 20:37:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please work out in your head whats 167 * 1.37? For the calories please?

There are still 4 hours left til this shop closes and there should be hot food.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14563558_10210599904696755_4915806273072176264_n.jpg?oh=c998dadaa5cb76bb590b89effb3b4e30&oe=58EA2D0D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14563558_10210599904696755_4915806273072176264_n.jpg?oh=9ada49b8e91d26dd19f31d38b177a3ab&oe=58E6C000	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210599904696755&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-10T17:19:26+0000	1476119966	2016-10-10 19:19:26	1	11	1	0	12	10	5	5	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I mentioned this to the staff  and it s not the first time  their response  tell Head Office we need new machines  today was  you can put your big clubcard into the slot on the machine!  I managed to work that out for myself but didn t have my credit card sized clubcard with me!  Inefficient equipment  staff with no customer service skills - sort yourselves out Tesco Uttoxeter!					2016-10-10T17:10:39+0000	1476119439	2016-10-10 19:10:39	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last week they were in packs of six. I get home and find both packs are missing an apple from each. A quick bit of maths has led me to deduce that now there is only five. Since the packaging is clearly made for six apples to be present I thought I should let you know that there must be a dirty  rotten apple thief on the loose. I will provide any assistance you require to hunt down and apprehend this delinquent.  P.S. I have no particular skills in tracking just an upbeat attitude.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14650654_10211047462087984_7921464436541186959_n.jpg?oh=64ab2d0e947fa06ad877129c07ba2141&oe=58EF0329	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14650654_10211047462087984_7921464436541186959_n.jpg?oh=ad47a4c7dac7caa61f3aa3298ea797ba&oe=58E2AB24	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211047462087984&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-10T16:17:07+0000	1476116227	2016-10-10 18:17:07	21	3	30	1	34	3	1	2	7	0	21	0	0	9	0	0	0

Heartbroken to the point where I feel the need to write.  Amongst your ¬£3 Meal Deal offering used to be your Cajun Chicken wrap.  This alongside a soft drink and a packet of crisps or confectionery was delightful.  The wrap and it s soft tortilla  lettuce and that just-spicy-enough chicken made my day.  You took this away.  Sweet Chilli Chicken or Southern Fried just isn t cutting it.  It s been some time since you stopped offering the Cajun Chicken wrap but I m afraid the grieving continues. I cannot get over this hurt.  I feel as though I am cheating every time I purchase an alternative.  Please find it in your heart to make your wrap range glorious again.  Yours hopefully   Glen  #bringbackcajunchicken					2016-10-10T11:43:18+0000	1476099798	2016-10-10 13:43:18	14	8	18	2	28	8	4	4	12	0	14	1	0	3	0	0	0

Netto was a little bit of a different experience but overall cheaper with a surprisingly good selection and choice for shoppers. Since competition opened Tesco seemed to immediately sit up and make an effort  the store was re-vamped  socks seemed to have been pulled up and the shelves were well stocked  not before time...   Netto has since closed to the dismay of many. My real problem is that since your only competitor has closed down your store has really slipped back down again. Yesterday like most other weeks I chose to do my weekly shop at this local store for convenience  how disappointing to see huge gaps on many of the shelves yet again  many items I needed were missing  the shelf labels were there so I knew you were still selling the lines I wanted but so many things were out of stock or just hadn t been filled up  it was a struggle to find staff to ask and just a real let down. I had to go further out of my way to buy the items I needed. I made a concerted effort to use your store  I may as well cut my losses and drive to a different store permanently or even a different supermarket. Tesco you need to sort this out! Complacency is a luxury you can t afford in today s supermarket wars..					2016-10-10T09:19:08+0000	1476091148	2016-10-10 11:19:08	5	5	5	0	10	5	4	1	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Turns out there was absolutely no hope of receiving the washing machine for at least another week.  The tumble dryer will take longer.  This is completely unacceptable.  Tesco have had hundreds of pounds of my money for several days  and I ve now been told it will take 3-5 days to get that money back.    We are a family of 4  and I have no washing machine at home.  The order was placed because you promised a relatively speedy delivery and completely failed to deliver on your promise.

If so will this happen at tesco extra Hucknall?  I really welcome this if so.   Unfortunately I ve had several people cut across me to get into a parent and child space when they have no children as they are too bone idle to walk far or just want to use the cash machine or don t want the rebate doors getting bashed.   Having twins means the spaces are invaluable being able to open both doors fully to get them in and out. I wouldn t mind if the spaces were further away from the store and we walked further I think that would put more people off using them with having kids in the car.					2016-10-10T07:37:28+0000	1476085048	2016-10-10 09:37:28	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They have been worn to and from school and at play times  5 days a week for approx 4 weeks. We live less than 2 minutes walk from school so they have not had a lot of wear. I am now having to send them in trainers until Friday as 1 pair has a hole in the front and the other pair has lost half of its sole!!!!  I have asked my grandmother for the receipt to return them but unfortunately she cannot find it.

Last time I wanted your male staff to help me cut the bread. He refused and told me off that I m the only customer wanting to have the bread cut.  Yesterday Sunday I wanted to buy this bread and asked the female staff to cut the bread at around 7.30pm. She asked to walk to the cashier counter at the exit and pay first and walk all the way back to the bakery inside to have the bread cut.   I can t understand why I can t pay at the bakery. I also can t understand why I can t get the bread cut first before I walk all the way to the exit to pay. As a Tesco member  I m disgusted and extremely disappointed with such lousy service. I walk off without buying anything from Tesco.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14572181_10154005085948963_602472805847883272_n.jpg?oh=84f89ed4ce031fe7274577163322e0e5&oe=5917D2AC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14572181_10154005085948963_602472805847883272_n.jpg?oh=8c62f11dc900fff09c92e4c6d69f9e0c&oe=5918F2C7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154005085948963&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-10T06:16:13+0000	1476080173	2016-10-10 08:16:13	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I found it very unprofessional shocking to see my mother essentially accused of shoplifting fruit.   She walked passed this sign  took two satsumas and was followed back to the checkout. Very publicly the supervisor (Julie) who had followed my mother asked her if she had put two pieces of fruit in her bag. My mother was stunned and said she had taken free fruit. At this point people began to stare. The supervisor then retorted that the fruit was not free for her  but was for children only. Feeling very embarrassed my mother tried to explain that she didn t realise the fruit wasn t for everyone and that some other Tesco store had fruit to try. She was then made to turn over said fruit (I also turned over the piece she had given me) The supervisor then went her way.  I decided to have a look at the sign and realised how easily a person could not see the tiny print under the larger bold capital underlined  FREE FRUIT . My mother is of pension age and simply couldn t read the small print.  What disappoints me most in this situation is the manner in which my mother was treated. A simple quiet word asking if she realised the fruit was for children only would have been sufficient. A simple misunderstanding which should have been discreetly dealt with. I was incensed for my mother  but did not what to make her embarrassment worse.  The sign is clearly inadequate  I struggled to read the small print & have no problems with my eyesight. I suggest Martlesham Tesco rewrite their sign to read:  FREE FRUIT FOR KIDS  in large bold letters.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14563428_863362507096889_6856090561026390444_n.jpg?oh=1492be11b5ca53e4144524b43468f475&oe=591A2747	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14563428_863362507096889_6856090561026390444_n.jpg?oh=3a2e968e0ea15bf834e913cb2db9c1a5&oe=58E163B8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=863362507096889&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-09T23:29:21+0000	1476055761	2016-10-10 01:29:21	1	9	5	0	14	8	8	0	2	0	1	0	1	0	1	2	0

Whilst when you have babies the close spots are amazing  what parents really need after the first year is the extra door space. So what if an area towards the edge of your car parks was labelled  extra area  and every other space had hatching (or something) on it so if the car park wasn t packed people parked in every other space. That way you don t lose spaces but people that need the extra space can find it and walk a bit further. This could then be used by older customers that have difficulty but are not disabled and people who have brand new Ferrari s too! (Although they probably do home delivery!).					2016-10-09T21:54:35+0000	1476050075	2016-10-09 23:54:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I paid ¬£4 for next day delivery slot between 21:00 and 22:00 but the driver showed up at 19:43. and to top it off didn t  bring the main item (chicken) which I needed for tomorrow  hence paying the premium for the next day delivery.

I visited this afternoon and I m appalled by your pricing and offers approach. The strawberries were in prime position on an isle end with a big special offer ticket stating 400g for ¬£2. However when I picked them up I realised the packet was smaller and it read 300g! This is false advertising trying to get people to believe they are 400g! You used to sell them in 400g packets for ¬£2 too so I believed that they were to begin with. Also the store is littered with new tickets stating  ONLY ¬£...  In a yellow colour making you believe it is on an offer of some sort  however it is in fact just the normal price. I feel as if Tesco is trying to con me as of late and is wasting my time having to double and triple check all of your pricing and ticketing.   I hope you will address these matters promptly.

The t-shirt I wear was huge but I didn t care as it was about supporting a great cause.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14632877_192776364482421_6666670770404132085_n.jpg?oh=bdef769b3d64aee0d961dff97db4865b&oe=58D5D13F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14632877_192776364482421_6666670770404132085_n.jpg?oh=5cb8876e16ae59ddcd3397e188a6132d&oe=58E84AC0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=192776364482421&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-09T14:39:41+0000	1476023981	2016-10-09 16:39:41	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Have used scan and go 4 times and have had random check 4 times. That is not random. This time they said i did not scan a mango. They proceeded to do a full rescan of my whole shopping and then ended up charging me twice for the mango that I had scanned. I felt the need to complain as I felt I was made to feel like I had stolen the mango. Tesco sort out your technology a fiver if a gift voucher does not help. No wonder your share price is falling.

As a consumer I feel it is my duty to make conscientious decisions with regards to what I do and don‚Äôt buy in order to manage my impact on the environment  which is a big deal to me and should be for all of us.   Using your service  I very much appreciate the option to say no to plastic bags and to be able to buy loose fresh produce however this is where my gripe comes in. I purchase loose fruit and veg in order to avoid plastic packaging which cannot be recycled. When I placed my online order with yourselves  under ‚Äòcomments for delivery‚Äô I clearly stated ‚Äúplease use as little plastic packaging as possible‚Äù  yet you can imagine my frustration when my shopping arrived and still I find my single courgette  among others  arrive in individual plastic bags WITHIN a recyclable paper bag. Why is this? I will not accept that it ‚Äòmakes it easier for the cashier‚Äô as a single courgette is handled in exactly the same way  whether in or out of a bag. And I have no doubt that all of your cashiers are more than capable of handling 5 loose apples that are not held neatly together in a bag. To say it makes it easier would be an insult to your staff. I also disbelieve that it may be to protect the vegetable in question  as this plastic bag offers no padding and as I said  they all arrived together in a separate paper bag which could surely do the same job. After that  I am lost for reasons as to why this may be the case and so am disappointed in your staff‚Äôs lack of thought with regards to environmental impact and also a complete lack of regard for their customer‚Äôs requests  which were clearly stated before purchase.   Now  this is not a personal attack at the staff who packed my shopping as I‚Äôm sure they were following protocol set by the company (this is not the first instance). Therefore I am urging you  as a company  to go one step above the rest  and get rid of these unnecessary plastic produce bags completely. Paper bags are provided for mushrooms  why can‚Äôt they be used for all vegetables?  As a large company you have the power to influence and help thousands of other people to make positive changes. Think of the difference that could make  just with one small change. Empower people  don‚Äôt frustrate them by ruining their hard work.   Do not apologise for ‚Äòthis mistake‚Äô or simply thank me for my feedback. Tell me what you are going to do about this issue. I look forward to your reply.					2016-10-09T13:30:06+0000	1476019806	2016-10-09 15:30:06	6	7	6	0	13	7	3	4	2	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

What you start selling instead  for EXACTLY the same price  is the same product only much less of it. Pork loin steaks  you used to get 6 but now only 5... over 100g less in a packet. And the same with your chicken breast fillets.. over 100g less for the SAME PRICE!!!

Busy Sunday  found an aisle with only one person in front. After 2 of his items were scanned through he realised he d forgotten his wallet so ran out to the car park to get it from his car. I had ONE item  and my husband asked if he could just run ours through whilst he waited for the gentleman to return. He said he couldn t because he d already started scanning.  I could understand if he had already scanned a lot of items  but it was only 2 which he could easily have voided then rescanned.  When I suggested this  he IGNORED me and turned away from me! I wasn t rude in the slightest  and his lack of response was completely unnecessary.  If there is a company policy that prevented him doing so  he should have just said so. But as the guy on the next til seemed shocked he hadn t done as I suggested  I m guessing no such policy exists!					2016-10-09T11:12:04+0000	1476011524	2016-10-09 13:12:04	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t know how they re storing their food but recently we ve had-  * bread with a use by date 3 days to go that is inedible. Feels more like a week out of date it s so hard and dry * a microwaveable tub meal (one day out of date granted but still sealed) with squirming maggots inside * grated cheese bag with 4 days till use by with blue mould when unsealed.  I returned the bread which they said would be frozen then forwarded to the manufacturer. When I heard from the manufacturer it was obvious they hadn t seen the loaf and had been informed only that their product was a bit dry.

Just a quick message with regards to your parents and children parking bays. I live in Ammanford Wales and your store in our town is superb.  My only issue is people using the parent and child bays who have no children or display a disable badge  when the disabled bays are empty.   As a father of 2 children (4 and 12 months) I find your parents bays essential. The wider parking space allows me to safely remove and put my boys back in the car without damaging other parked vehicles whilst ensuring the safety of my children.  The purpose for which you have these bays.   I m really getting fed up of people using the bays who shouldn t be  but it ppears nothing is being done about it.  I have told staff on site but nothing ever appears to be actioned.   If it s evening and all the bays are free then it s no problem using one to pop in or use the cash point. But when it s busy  what can be done about it?  I d like to see a sign that states parents can use the disabled bays and vice versa IF THEIR OWN BAYS ARE FULL.  What are your views on this? In the big scheme of things it may seem trivial to others but to parents I belive it s an important issue that deserves consideration.  Every little helps? I honestly  hope so. Many thanks for your time in reading this. Andy.					2016-10-09T07:50:08+0000	1475999408	2016-10-09 09:50:08	1	3	2	1	6	3	2	1	2	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

She will always make time for him  knows him by name and will give him a hug  which he is only too happy to return.

She talked to me till he calmed down... definitely a credit to your store. Thank you Yvonne x					2016-10-08T20:54:50+0000	1475960090	2016-10-08 22:54:50	5	3	5	0	8	3	1	2	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I haven t been in since and probably never will. I bought a Sony Experia from the Oakham Store some months ago and then three weeks ago it refused to switch on leaving me without a phone. I am a taxi driver and so went to the store to see if anything could be done. Nothing could according to the staff I saw there and was told I would have to take it to get repaired and so I bought another cheap mobile to get me by as it was and is my livelihood. A couple of days later I rang customer service and a lady by the name of Hannah said she could help me out and over the phone gave me instructions as to what was probably wrong and explained what to do. This was totally successful and my Sony is now perfect again. When I explained to her I had bought another phone to get me by she told me to go back to the store and they would probably refund me the ¬£25 it cost. This I did only to be told by a woman on Customer Service  and I quote  If you want your money back I suggest you take your phone back to the person who told you to bring it here  and ask her for it  That is where the conversation with this person in Oakham ended. I wasn t over bothered about the ¬£25 but I was flabbergasted at the rudeness of the comment. If she didn t want to give me a refund that is fine. There are ways of dealing with customers though  and I am sure this isn t one of them. Consequently  she has lost Tesco a customer.					2016-10-08T20:37:12+0000	1475959032	2016-10-08 22:37:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Finding food in the reduced section but the staff haven t reduced some of it.  Also when second reductions are done. Not all of the going out of date food is been reduced again.  Also identical items end up with different prices.  When I asked about this. The staff member was rude and just went off with the food.  Also when I asked another time if they were going to reduce some meat that was going out of date that day  which was in the reduced section. This was about 2 in the afternoon.  I was told it couldn t be reduced for another half an hour					2016-10-08T19:59:54+0000	1475956794	2016-10-08 21:59:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in on Friday around 6pm with my children  and as I m trying to encourage my 10 year old autistic son social and communicative skills  he went up to customer services to get some flowers wrapped. Now usually we would be rushed through these opportunities with very little interaction  and child centred approach to conversations  this young gentleman was so patient  kind and gave my son perfect opportunities to facilitate his conversing skills  he gave him full attention  asked him questions  got to his level and made it a really positive experience for him. It s the little things like this that pave the way to positive interactions and build confidence and self esteem to such children who perhaps struggle in situations we take for granted.  I only know his name was Ben (which my son is also Ben which naturally made his day) he helped on customer services but was in a Tesco Mobile uniform and usually on that department. Thank you Ben!

Hint of chilli  no taste of crab (apart from the crunchy bits which I don t think should be there) and an over-riding flavour of stale lemon.  Hey ho  should have nicked the boss  Finest paella.  That went down a treat  so I observed while stirring round my lemon main course in the vague hope it might redeem itself.  Just to compound the issue  post meal  the dog wolfed down the remains of the paella whilst treating the linguine with total disdain.					2016-10-08T18:50:29+0000	1475952629	2016-10-08 20:50:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When we got home and checked the receipt we found we had been charged for 3 bunches of flowers when we only bought 2. We also purchased 2 packs of picture hanging strips that had been reduced from ¬£4 each to ¬£1.50 a pack  we were charged full price for them both. I phoned the store and in a very rushed call I was told to take my receipt back in to store. I asked if I could uses a more local store to us to sort the problem but unfortunately I was told this was not possible. On Monday we returned to Hemsworth and was given a refund for the flower over charge and our money back for the picture strips  not given them at the reduced price they were marked at  your colleague took the items from us and refunded our money. We weren t offered so much as an apology for being over charged almost ¬£10 never mind something towards our diesel costs or our time  in fact your colleague found it funny and laughed as she said she hoped this wasn t our first experience at shopping with Tesco! It wasn t our first  but if this is how a company like yours treats it s customers  it will be our last!					2016-10-08T16:41:55+0000	1475944915	2016-10-08 18:41:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst I m all for this (if its true)  I m concerned that they are completely overlooking pregnant women.   I m 8 months pregnant and whilst walking and having enough energy to shop is difficult enough at that stage  I also suffer from severe pelvic girdle pain and am on crutches. I have had a couple people make comments when I have parked at my local tesco in the parents bays because I don t always have my 5 year old with me  or shoot me dirty looks before I even get out of my car based on assumptions.    Many of your competitors make it clear that parents spaces are also welcome to be used by expectant mothers - I have on more than one occasion gone there instead to avoid the hassle at tesco.   If you could recognise expectant mothers as part of parents welcome to park on parent bays this would be welcome in my opinion -particularly if you are looking to start fining people. It s very difficult for women at that stage to have energy or stamina to go to the store and  every little helps!   even if it s a small gesture like making pregnant women feel more welcome.    If pregnant women aren t welcome to park in parent bays  why not? Yiu cannot assume that every pregnant woman is able bodied and even the underground has bump badges so women don t have to ask for a seat or be made to feel uncomfortable.    Pelvic girdle pain is actually given temporary blue badges at some councils and there is a movement to recognise this across more areas - and up to 20% of women suffer this in pregnancy. So please bear in mind this demographic before you start letting unsympathetic employees give penalty fines and generally make sire that they are aware that not every disability is visible either!!   Just because someone can walk doesn t mean they don t suffer ulcerative colitis  crohns  fibromyalgia   or some other illness that means they are disabled.  I hope you have thought through exactly how employees would be equipped with the judgement before they send across pictures to the parking enforcers for fines - staff in customer services generally need up skilling on equality and diversity and you could be opening a massive can of worms.					2016-10-08T16:28:58+0000	1475944138	2016-10-08 18:28:58	2	8	4	0	12	4	2	2	2	0	2	1	0	1	0	0	0

Went shopping there today and my 5yr old helped himself to a piece of free fruit which he chose an apple however when he bit into it the apple was wrotten which made my son spit it out straight aay and was very upset. I took the apple to customer services which the lady said sorry and left it at that. As I walked back to where my son was standing with my mum a gentleman walked out of the staff private area and I asked for a cup of water so my son could get rid of the taste of apple which the gentleman got and asked if everything was ok when I explained what happened he got down to my son s level and asked if he was ok and offered him a free bag of sweets. I was expecting a pack of sweets however the bloke returned with a multipack of haribo to say sorry. Unfortunately I didn t get the blokes name but he was fantastic and when I saw him again in store he asked again if my son was ok. I just want you to know that he is a lovely bloke and very helpful.					2016-10-08T15:53:03+0000	1475941983	2016-10-08 17:53:03	2	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

There was a very small problem with communication regarding my home grocery delivery  and the lateness of the delivery combined ironically with a few apologetic calls from yourselves meant Emily was woken up and could nt settle afterwards. I do not know of any other supermarket that would take the time or kindness to send out a lovely package for us as an apology  my daughter is extremely happy with her dvd  and lots of chocolates and my flowers are beautiful. Thankyou again from a very happy customer and little one xx	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14591753_1288160147863513_568496374425261535_n.jpg?oh=5462b62b0f1bd14f6350b75e7698e492&oe=58E078D4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14591753_1288160147863513_568496374425261535_n.jpg?oh=6b02824d222b2598a548d409d2ed0a67&oe=58E9A649	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1288160147863513&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-08T15:38:34+0000	1475941114	2016-10-08 17:38:34	18	4	20	2	26	4	3	1	2	0	18	2	0	0	0	0	0

My darling husband is working tomorrow so I decided to make our roast dinner today so he would not miss out. All was going well my tesco pork shoulder joint was roasting in the oven with crackling that would make any denture wearer shudder. My maris piper roasties were turning golden and I had an almost nigella like glow about me. The only thing left was to make my homemade apple sauce - with my butter and sugar weighed out in the saucepan I started to peel my large bramley apples. Imagine my shock nay horror when I peel the third to discover brown spots all the way through! I now have only 2/3 the amount of my apple sauce and 3 apple sauce loving children. Do you understand the position I am now in? How do I keep the identity of my favourite child secret when I am now forced to choose which child shares homemade apple sauce with myself and their father and which 2 have sauce from a jar!!! Surely this could all have been avoided if you employed pickers with xray vision who could have seen the vile gruesomness that was hiding beneath the perfect green skin.  I hope your Saturday is less tragic than mine üò•	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14522959_10211184074546113_7740492110300590175_n.jpg?oh=ebe14d6d29152a1e049b185e020908a9&oe=58DFE621	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14522959_10211184074546113_7740492110300590175_n.jpg?oh=72664b8b8aa2d823adc7ff1124531d1f&oe=5922E32C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211184074546113&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-08T15:16:01+0000	1475939761	2016-10-08 17:16:01	0	2	0	1	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sad that your system can t recognise a vehicle that is registered tax exempt disabled - the London congestion charge and the Dartford crossing can and Matalan in Stevenage use a system where you register your Blue Badge with the store.					2016-10-08T15:04:14+0000	1475939054	2016-10-08 17:04:14	2	5	3	0	8	5	4	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

I ve just had the run around looking for the  Speak Out Game  at your Merthyr and Aberdare stores. Tesco direct shows that they are in both stores. I popped to Merthyr last night and the shelf with the ticket on was empty  it has been for around a week now. I asked on customer services and the gent informed me that there were 8 in stock and popped to the warehouse to see if he could find any  he didn t have much luck but asked me to pop in when someone on the department was there to have a good look.  In the meantime I popped to the aberdare store as I thought it may be easier and it showed the game was in stock according to the website. When I got there  there wasn t even a ticket for the item  the store assistant wasn t much help and just palmed it off as not being put on display yet. I then returned to the Merthyr Tesco  I advised the assistant that I was told by customer services that there were 8 in stock but the shelves have been empty for days. The advisor told me she d been through most of the crates this morning and if it wasn t there it wasn t there  after reiterating that customer services said last night there was 8 in stock she went to the warehouse  again to no avail.  I m quite disappointed not so much by the customer service  but at the fact you obviously seem to have some stock issues in both stores and the fact that some colleagues are not even bothered by the discrepancy in the store systems and the actual stock levels... I hope that you will feed this back to both stores as obviously there is something going amiss and they can then take the relevant measures to resolve the issues.   Unfortunately  someone will not be getting the game as a birthday gift off me due to this issue but hopefully you can prevent it happening to others!					2016-10-08T14:33:35+0000	1475937215	2016-10-08 16:33:35	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Basically I went to Gatwick tesco last week to buy a TV  got the TV home in a taxi safely And there was a leak in the screen. I took the TV back to tesco walked it all the way the top floor at the back of the store for an exchange for the same TV   The staff was quiet blunt and rude! I was then asked to go back to the bottom floor front of the store to get another tv (no staff was offered for help with this big tv)  by the time I got back upstairs with tv I was only then informed all these tvs kept being returned for faults and would I like to look for one at the same size?  I them went to find a third tv however there were none for the same size at the same price only one that was the same size but ¬£20 more..  I then carried a 3rd to the counter again with no help from staff. Just my mother who is quiet poorly herself! I paid the extra and carried this tv to the taxi  To now find out I also have to return to the store to return this 3rd tv due to a fault with the software on the apps as it s unfit for purpose. I would like to know what s going on with all the TVs and the rudeness from the staff??

Very disturbed to read on the back that it is  harmful to aquatic life with long lasting effects .  My question is  why have they made this product when it is clearly not an essential product.  I intend to send it back to proctor and gamble and ask them why exactly are they making products that are not needed and are toxic to the environment!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14502892_1196321080440709_9046265935321956215_n.jpg?oh=794b36dedd823ce2c3409bbab45f476d&oe=58E41C25	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14502892_1196321080440709_9046265935321956215_n.jpg?oh=57f8007d8f094d075379ba63788f113f&oe=59181F30	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1196321080440709&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-08T13:01:20+0000	1475931680	2016-10-08 15:01:20	0	5	0	0	5	4	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I hear you are planning to have you staff monitor disabled parking spaces for unbadged and illicit use. This is at the same time both a correct and generous act as the level of misuse these days is becoming intolerable. Just this morning I was at a rival supermarket and saw a large Mercedes being parked in a disabled bay and the young woman who got out (wearing running shoes) walked rapidly into the store  showing no hint of disability at all  nor displaying a blue badge. Frankly it is acts such as this that now encourage me to support your store if you in turn are supporting disabled people. For your information this may be repeated as word is already travelling amongst disabled groups in social media. Thank you.					2016-10-08T12:23:11+0000	1475929391	2016-10-08 14:23:11	0	7	0	0	7	7	6	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Instead of Tesco shutting their express store to carry out refurbishments they decided to keep the store open whiles they carry out the refurbishment.  Last night was a joke as they were ripping up part of the pavement to put in a Sign and they were refitting the roof outside in the loading bay. Mind you this was at peak time around 6pm motorists were trying to find parking spaces to go inside . Five parking spaces were taken up by work vans ect.  The chaos continues today.  There s a massive generator parked over two parking spaces with a massive power cable going past the entrance doors. Easily a tripping hazard. Trolleys in the middle of the parking spaces. Tobacco unit out of cigarettes even tho people wanted them. And to top it off a eddie stobart wagon parked between tesco and the middle of blackpool road blocking traffic					2016-10-08T08:37:38+0000	1475915858	2016-10-08 10:37:38	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I witnessed this personally and thought it was despicable..everyone in the store at that time just stood with their mouths open..SHOCKING! behaviour from someone on the managerial staff. I would like to know who to complain to or at least know that this particular manager has been severely reprimanded.					2016-10-08T08:29:38+0000	1475915378	2016-10-08 10:29:38	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In particular sliced meat where the meat on view appears to be good quality but once the packet is open the second and subsequent slices are fatty and full of gristle.  Or when the label strategicly covers the poor quality food.  I have contacted your customer service department about this in the past and sent pictures but received a very poor response to the point of rudeness.  The latest example.  This ham is disgusting I have had to cut huge lumps of inedible gristle from it.

My order was supposed to be delivered between 4-5pm but still waiting at 5.45pm. Rang once  they couldn t get hold of driver or store...but assure me store will ring me back. Its now 6.30pm and rang you AGAIN and now they tell me there was a problem with payment and even though i paid it didn t go through before the driver went out at 1pm. Right  you rang me at work at 11.30  i rang you back at 11.48 and sorted it. I know this as my mobile shows the times. Delivery might come before 11pm. Rang them back to tell them i dont appreciate the insinuation thats its my fault as i called them back within 18mins  much apologising...they still cant contact the store and due to the time they cant check if the payment has gone through so might not even get my delivery. Now I ve had to go out and buy more food for dinner tonight. Wonderful delivery driver was told by his manager to ring me when he was on his way and he got to me for 7pm  not an issue with the driver BUT STILL waiting for the store manager to contact me...fuming doesn t cover it!!! üò†üò°üò†üò°üò†üò°üò†					2016-10-08T06:20:18+0000	1475907618	2016-10-08 08:20:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After fighting my way past staff haphazardly re-stocking and a rather stupid layout I finally queued at 22:56. Having reached the checkout at 23:01 I was informed that the alcoholic items in my basket  and still on display  could not be served to me.  Might I suggest that you employ enough staff to open enough tills to service the queue in a timely manner and to also inform your staff of the legalities of the sale of alcohol which would have allowed them to serve me under the circumstances.  I wouldn t be so irked but your staff weren t even trained enough to feign an apology and to make eye contact rather than staring at my rather cool hat (The last point may be my fault).  As it stands I left the store disappointed at 23:03. Cheers guys.					2016-10-07T22:26:15+0000	1475879175	2016-10-08 00:26:15	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My other half rang in a panic to find a cd for our sons first birthday party tomorrow morning. After the lady helping on the phone he tells her he will come now and buy a Disney cd and frozen one. When he gets there they gave him a bag full of presents ( admittedly they thought it was a girl because of the frozen cd) but it s such a lovely thing to do. It s brightened our dull evening after our cat has had to go into a vets because she s really poorly.  So thank you again Tesco for your brilliant customer service and going above and beyond for customer satisfaction!

I went into your store on Sinclaire Street in Helensburgh today with my 15 year old autistic son. On entering I noted there were woman wearing  stand up to cancer  packing bags at the checkouts. ( A very worthy cause).  The store was quite busy and my son was showing signs of becoming anxious early on. By the time we reached the checkout he was gripping at his ears  lashing out and starting to shake. This is where your Helensburgh team really showed they re worth their weight in gold!  Whilst in the line a staff member asked if he could help in any way. I explained the issues my son was having. He went to the bag packer and quietly explained  and then he and the bag packer walked away from the till without saying a word. The lady on the checkout ( Margaret) put the  till closing  sign on and asked me very quietly if I needed bags or a hand packing. As I was holding my son she took my shopping from me and loaded it onto the conveyor belt  and packed it away. No fuss  no song and dance  just gentle grace. I paid and thanked her and left the shop. On leaving the sign was removed  Margaret had more customers pass through her checkout and the bag packer returned to her task. I managed to leave with my son in shut down mode NOT melt down. I didn t have to ditch my shopping and leave without my groceries. I didn t have to restrain him. I didn t have to lift him from the floor.  May not seem a big deal to some  but to me this was the best service from any store ever. The staff just knew what to do. I can not thank you enough!					2016-10-07T20:42:30+0000	1475872950	2016-10-07 22:42:30	23647	950	26279	1630	28859	940	887	53	518	0	23418	2434	155	6	4	1	0

I ordered a toy from your online sale and at the checkout was given the option of standard delivery or paying extra for specific day delivery. It was my nieces birthday  so decided to pay extra for specific day delivery  to ensure it arrived on time. My parcel did not arrive!! I contacted Tesco via email to ask where my order was  I had no response for a couple of days! Today I received an email with a full refund with no explanation. After telling my niece she still had a gift to arrive I now have to tell her it s not coming or try and find it else where!!

Stephane was brilliant  he took his time telling our son the names of each fish  letting him hold them  showing him the differences between them all and explaining to him where in the water all the different fish live. Our son hasn t stopped reciting all the information since and has now decided he wants to be a fisherman when he s older!  Stephane is a credit and an asset to your company. Thank you Stephane  we hope you get all the recognition you deserve!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14484616_10155307432113574_5744119726139689739_n.jpg?oh=f392d9787749ce487f763eaf50f52ad7&oe=591B6061	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14484616_10155307432113574_5744119726139689739_n.jpg?oh=10a5368696141da42c988fbf1127f9ad&oe=58DCAC6C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155307432113574&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-07T19:17:38+0000	1475867858	2016-10-07 21:17:38	663	23	705	59	787	23	18	5	89	0	663	41	1	0	0	0	0

Me  my wife and my two sons visited the Rotherham store last week. My youngest son has signs of Autism and struggles in a supermarket environment. But not last week!!  What a great idea to have trollies with cars on the front for the young ones to sit in!  Oscar loved the car and his supermarket experience. My eldest son is six and he was entertained by self scanning the shopping items.  All in all a normally traumatic experience turned into a family fun filled hour! Thank you Tesco.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14632887_10154641207080719_3710865719070022625_n.jpg?oh=896b00a7d3135846e5cf080b4ba96177&oe=58DA4705	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14632887_10154641207080719_3710865719070022625_n.jpg?oh=469e260bb22a00a31fb0c5515558b0f8&oe=5917E708	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154641207080719&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-07T18:59:10+0000	1475866750	2016-10-07 20:59:10	47	4	53	1	58	4	4	0	0	0	46	5	0	1	0	0	0

I rarely get to indulge in baking and today I decided to bake brownies. Having bought all the ingredients from Tesco  I followed the recipe and lined my tin with your greaseproof paper. Imagine the horror to find after baking that the paper has welded itself to the base of my brownies! I am truly devastated that my hard work has been ruined due to what is supposedly grease proof paper not doing its job!  It did the same thing the other week with home made pizzas too! In all my years of baking with your baking items  I am surprised that this has happened and will certainly not be using your own grease proof paper again.					2016-10-07T18:27:24+0000	1475864844	2016-10-07 20:27:24	1	5	1	0	6	5	4	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was very lucky not to swallow it due to its diameter in size  being as the product was  Tescos Finest  Moroccan Chicken Soup  it certainly wouldn t have been fine if my colleagues had to do the Heimlich maneuver at my desk.  Please can you get back to me  I have kept the piece of plastic - definitely questioning where I buy my lunch now!

Popped into the Tesco extra in hastings on Thursday and saw this peppa pig easel on sale in the half price toy area for ¬£17.50 didn t buy it as wanted to check it was going to be suitable  it was  so looked online a bit later and it has sold out online  so today went all the way back to the Tesco extra (I live in Bexhill) especially to get it but the price ticket has gone back up to ¬£35 although it s still stocked in the half price toy section. Why can t the store honour the sale price? It clearly says it s ¬£17.50 on your website and is sold by Tesco and is stocked in a Tesco store  the customer service assistant wasn t very helpful at all!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14519854_10154566418370917_2800005926498926574_n.jpg?oh=255de603a1641832dcf6793874c9330b&oe=58E44E10	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14519854_10154566418370917_2800005926498926574_n.jpg?oh=5d2db1ae1fdda49ffea13008815e76da&oe=591B8E1D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154566418370917&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-07T11:36:23+0000	1475840183	2016-10-07 13:36:23	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had them delivered yesterday  and this morning when I went to use the sweetener  powder grinded out. I thought maybe two had been stuck  so I banged it on the counter dislodging one tablet. I clicked for a second   and the same thing happened but this time I could tell there was a lump. I peeled off the labels to pry it open  dumped the 800 odd tablet ls into a container  and started sorting. As you can see   these are the lumps leftover. I don t even know if the tablets I put back are safe from moisture or if they will wind up sticking together too.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14520346_10154663883767160_4543736290186123473_n.jpg?oh=76dc00c46fc33509c555048a74efe74b&oe=58DF1709	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14520346_10154663883767160_4543736290186123473_n.jpg?oh=9ad3f726f66de2d05a4ae2546fe868cd&oe=58E4F404	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154663883767160&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-07T10:17:05+0000	1475835425	2016-10-07 12:17:05	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an order for home delivery on Sat 1st October - order number 601566906  It was ordered to delivered between 7 & 8pm on Sunday 2nd October at 19.33 on Sunday I received 2 texts to say my order had been delayed the first said it would be delivered between 21.05 & 21.50 and the second one said it would be delivered between 19.00 and 21.51.  At 21.22 I rang the customer service department for an update where I was told that my driver had one more delivery before mine and they would be with me no later than 22.00.  As a gesture of good will they would send me a voucher - which they did for ¬£7.00.  It is now 23.50 on a Sunday evening and I still haven t received my shopping  I am now going to have to get up early in the morning and go shopping to buy my children s pack lunch items - at an extra cost to myself  as this should of all been delivered.  This is totally unacceptable  I have not been kept informed of anything since 19.33 this evening  and no one has told me that my shopping isn t actually going to arrive.   I would also like more than a ¬£7 voucher for the inconvenience. I do my main food shop with you on a weekly basis  I am also in the Cheam Park shop on an almost daily basis  I am a regular shopper of Tesco and don t want to have to start shopping elsewhere.  Please look into this as a matter of urgency.  UPDATE - 2 further phone calls to your customer service  one on Monday morning where I was told my order had been cancelled the evening before due to problems with the lorries and I should of been informed - which I wasn t  and then yesterday 6 October to find out where my refund was that I was told had been processed on Monday morning - where I was informed it actually hadn t been processed...so Tesco you were going to keep my ¬£68 and not deliver my food...

Every time I try to add something to my order ( which I have previously checked out earlier) after 23:30 the servers are down/somethings gone wrong/or sign out and try again comes up. So realistically you have to make changes earlier than stated. It happens every time and is extremely annoying. Has anyone else had this problem??					2016-10-06T23:21:37+0000	1475796097	2016-10-07 01:21:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased two pairs of pjs in size 20-22. I m having a bath and then go to put one pair on. The package didn t look like it was touch when I purchased it nor prior to me attempting to wear them. The tshirt looked rather small and I checked this and somehow turned out to be size 8-10 I check the bottoms and somehow they were 16-18. Also I was on the self service checkout and did not know that they had tags on until I attempted to wear them.   I don t understand how this could be unless it was a packing error.   The second pair of pjs were the correct size but the tag is on the bottoms so I can t wear them. Maybe you could inform staff they have tags on as I did not see any other clothing with tags on.   I will put more photos on in comments	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14494875_10154078256550939_9199440219846488626_n.jpg?oh=694455bb577bff4623fdc74131b86c7d&oe=58EE1CD7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14494875_10154078256550939_9199440219846488626_n.jpg?oh=3ab36de0df6f5560aefd80659042910d&oe=58E8EADA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154078256550939&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-06T21:35:50+0000	1475789750	2016-10-06 23:35:50	0	10	0	0	10	9	2	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At 8.30pm my partner rang tesco (colchester) to be told our shopping had been delivered & signed for. It had NOT been delivered to our address so it was clear the driver had delivered it to the wrong address. After an hour of constantly being on hold etc  we were then told nothing could be done tonight & we would have to wait till tomorrow. We explained that we need our food because our 4 year old daughter needs breakfast & lunch for school tomorrow. No one cared. We were told nothing could be done because the shopping had been signed for which WASN T by neither of us. None of this is our fault  & it feels like we are being punished. My partner then questioned whether he could go to the store & collect our shopping & they said no. He then asked if it could be delivered  they said no. The woman on the phone was very difficult to deal with  awful customer service. We are owed ¬£50 worth of shopping. We have NO money now due to you withdrawing the money  & NO shopping. This is absolutely disgusting. We cannot afford to fund someone else s cupboards & fridge. The only people at fault are yourselves  hiring drivers that are clearly incapable of reading an address & checking it has been delivered to the right people! Once this mess has been resolved  we will no longer be shopping with tesco. Absolutely shocking customer service  & even worse delivery service!!					2016-10-06T21:04:49+0000	1475787889	2016-10-06 23:04:49	6	31	13	3	47	31	19	12	19	0	6	0	2	0	0	5	0

Is their some kind of secret password  firewalk or special dance you have to do? I swore I d never shop with direct again after my experience last year (won t go into that now) but I stupidly took advantage of a decent offer you had on Lego. Anyway got emails to collect along with the opening times of the direct desk. Supposedly open until 8pm tonight! I went at 6.40pm to be met with this sign (picture below) no problem and half expected it because it NEVER seems to be open!! So rang the number to be told  We ve closed that desk down  and the person on the other end really didn t seem to want to help but eventually said  I ll see what I can do but I may be a while  he was a while! 7pm I eventually got to see a human to be told  We normally close the desk at 7  even though I was there 20 minutes before that and mentioned the email says it s open until 8pm and got the reply  Yes we re supposed to be  anyway I finally got my parcel and I really won t be ordering from direct again as it s so impossible to collect but you might want to sort it out before the Christmas rush for other peoples sake!! It seems once you ve received money on line there is literally zero customer service!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14495432_336862303323157_1250153790922736566_n.jpg?oh=e60055470d0242efc65bcede7b0ff87f&oe=58E03A2D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14495432_336862303323157_1250153790922736566_n.jpg?oh=1ceed01bc2f6b8d627344783f1dc08cf&oe=58D8FDD2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=336862303323157&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-06T19:44:49+0000	1475783089	2016-10-06 21:44:49	4	9	4	0	13	8	3	5	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

For at least 6 weeks I ve been trying to get hold of your Free From Tiger Rolls.   You can t imagine how delighted I was to see that I could add them to my order for delivery this evening... they ve always previously been unavailable.  I was so excited  I showed my colleague and informed her that I was going to rush home to make soup to have with my crusty rolls.  Which I did.   When my order arrived  the rolls were missing...  not available .  Please can you tell me if the Free From Tiger Rolls exist? Or are they mythical creatures like unicorns? Or are they real  but evasive and fleeting  like my happiness after my gluten intolerance diagnosis? Where can I find them?  I just need to know whether to give up this hope.  Jade  P.S. Your Free From range is amaze balls and thanks for getting GF Betty Crocker. My mate Debbie and I love your Angel Slices. They re kind of like vanilla and pink brownies.					2016-10-06T18:55:43+0000	1475780143	2016-10-06 20:55:43	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After using the tablet for nearly 3 weeks  I came across a news item online regarding a recall of Amazon Fire tablet power adapters due to risk of electrocution.  The recall was back in March so I was suprised that my new tablet was supplied with one of the faulty power adapters.  As tablets are still being sold with the faulty power adapters  I would expect Tesco to advise their customers that they need to obtain a replacement power adapter from Amazon free of charge.  Details of the recall are on the Tesco website with the advise that the original adapter should not be used. I ve twice tried to post a review of the tablet on the Tesco website to alert other purchasers to this issue but my reviews have been rejected.					2016-10-06T17:30:37+0000	1475775037	2016-10-06 19:30:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know offers finish on certain dates but 2 weeks is taking the mickey  when a customer sees an advertised offer they expect it to be valid as it s up in the store.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14606427_10154400346765491_3685534589245677483_n.jpg?oh=4536c0ad882697cfa0af87611c7310a4&oe=58D62806	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14606427_10154400346765491_3685534589245677483_n.jpg?oh=62bc6dbd060cf7de489f94584dca6328&oe=58ED780B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154400346765491&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-06T16:21:55+0000	1475770915	2016-10-06 18:21:55	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I saw no rspca assured signs or any other signs to reassure me that I wasn t buying fish which hadn t been farmed unethically. To me  farmed  means a cramped  unethicall  inhumane method of raising fish. It s time Tescos understood their customers concerns and responded to them accordingly. Animal welfare is very high in many of your consumers  priority list when shopping. Transparent labelling is not enough.

The Sale of Goods Act makes reference to ‚Äòthe seller‚Äô  this is the shop  the retailer  or the individual you bought it from  and is who you made the contract with. It is not the manufacturer  and don‚Äôt let the shop tell you otherwise! If there is an obvious fault with the item at any time within the first 6 months and it has not been caused by wear and tear or misuse  your first port of call must be the shop you bought it from. They have the responsibility to put the matter right  and should not evade this responsibility by referring you to the manufacturer in the context of a guarantee or warranty. Even after this 6 month period  if the item breaks down prematurely   you should always go back to the shop or retailer in the first instance.   I bought a vacuum cleaner from  Hughes  one of your partners  who told me that my  one month guarantee with them had expired  and they wanted nothing to do with me  didn t even offer an apology!; fair enough if they want to not follow legislation present to protect consumers  however as they are selling through Tesco  it makes Tesco liable for any faults that may occur.  The first chap I spoke to was very friendly  although managed to cut me off 20-25 minutes into conversation; reconnecting  the second chap told me that The Sale of Goods Act only applies to the first 60 days (he wasn t interested in being told otherwise!)   I am now without a vacuum cleaner for two weeks until an engineer from the vacuum cleaner company comes to assess it.   The Sale of Goods Act is there to ensure retailers look after their customers and fix any problems they may have. You cannot simply sell a faulty product and then tell the customer  sorry it s not our problem!  This is not the first instance of this happening through Tesco  so it is safe to say I will no longer be purchasing electrical products from you.  Rant over.	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDJni7e9GWwi0Fv&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwhatconsumer.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F01%2Fscale_220.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQDvLFWDnaBdnraQ	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAyxXgakBdUbtcn&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwhatconsumer.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F01%2Fscale_220.jpg&_nc_hash=AQDaKNRnchMLQ895	http://whatconsumer.co.uk/shops-responsibility/#ixzz4MJf6rVvh	whatconsumer.co.uk	2016-10-06T14:49:36+0000	1475765376	2016-10-06 16:49:36	0	8	0	0	8	8	3	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Felt I was inconveniencing the employee. Doubt it s what you want your customers to feel					2016-10-06T13:15:50+0000	1475759750	2016-10-06 15:15:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On the 4th August 2016 I exchanged my vouchers online  planning for a meal out with friends. The vouchers never arrived via e-mail. I phoned Clubcard and they said they would send them again. They never arrived. I phoned them  they said they would e-mail them again  they blamed a change in the IT servers. They still never arrived. I phoned again and asked them to be posted  they never arrived. I phone again yesterday and they sent them to a new e-mail address  they have not arrived. I will phone again today to get them posted again!!. I receive plenty of Tesco mails for password re-sets and I have been posted some new Clubcards to my home address. So can Tesco tell me when will I get my vouchers!! My friends and I are very hungry now after 2 months of waiting!!!!!!!!!!!					2016-10-06T12:27:05+0000	1475756825	2016-10-06 14:27:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

His elder brother has been very poorly. and has just recently come out of hospital. At the breakfast table this morning  we were discussing where we could get a wheelchair from  one that would be suitable for a 13 year old. just so we can get him out of the house to enjoy some fresh air. we named various places. Then with great excitement my little boys says   Mummy  Tesco shopping is coming today  have we got time to add it to the list ?  we laughed at his sweetness. and his belief you can get anything you need from Tesco.					2016-10-06T11:52:50+0000	1475754770	2016-10-06 13:52:50	4	4	4	0	8	4	1	3	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did encountered some issues with the collection or delivery (items with short shelf life or not in good condition for example) but I just simply contact Tesco customer service and straight away the problem/issue is solved. Also in store (especially Windsor)  the staff is extremely helpful  polite and always ready to help which!

I m not able to return them to the store but I have phoned the customer services number on your website in an attempt to alert staff; however  the call centre worker was unable to connect me to the store or help me herself and so did not take note of the batch numbers  and I cannot seem to phone the store directly. I am not worried about a refund but I am concerned that someone could potentially become quite poorly if further bottles in this batch are drunk. Batch numbers are: - JUN17 X301 6253 08 5009310 - JUN17 X301 6253 08 5008015 - JUN17 X301 6253 08 5102027					2016-10-06T09:03:36+0000	1475744616	2016-10-06 11:03:36	1	6	1	1	8	6	1	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to your Brockworth store today (tesco extra) and took my two little ones (1 and 3)  not only did they very much enjoy their free apples  but they had a lovely time chatting with the fishmonger. He entertained my 3 year old  taught her a bit about the fish  made her laugh and gave them both a fish sticker. He made their day. I didn t get his name  but he was there around 4.30 this afternoon and deserves a pat on the back. Good job that man!					2016-10-05T22:12:08+0000	1475705528	2016-10-06 00:12:08	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I haven t been feeling so great after a recent operation  so when my tesco order was delivered last week  the delivery man very kindly unpacked everything for me.  My most recent order was delivered today and I was amazed when the delivery lady presented me with a get well soon card  a beautiful bouquet of flowers and a Mexican meal.   It was such a lovely  lovely surprise and it really brightened my day!! It is so unusual to see such outstanding customer service in this day and age and I cannot thank you enough. You really go the extra mile for your customers. Excellent  excellent customer service!!  Thank you once again and an extra big thanks to the store in question (I think it may be the Carrickfergus store in Northern Ireland)  Brilliant!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14606453_10157799576045122_1490793686909443370_n.jpg?oh=aa90de676c315fab7f3b6df611a57c62&oe=58E222F8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14606453_10157799576045122_1490793686909443370_n.jpg?oh=2438a71e10981e87910121ebeda18c89&oe=58EE331E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157799576045122&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-05T22:03:47+0000	1475705027	2016-10-06 00:03:47	20	2	24	0	26	2	2	0	2	0	20	2	1	0	0	0	0

Bought this today from your south oxhey (Watford) petrol station for my son to do cooking with at school tmw and we just went to measure out how much he needed and these came out with it.  I will add more photos of close ups in the comments. I will be taking the whole lot back to the shop tmw to show them too and no doubt all I will be offered is my money back (83p üòÇ)  Please somehow make sure someone else doesn t have these too. What if I had of not looked and just put it in a pan to boil  makes me shiver at the thought.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14495323_10155359155613508_1243250795975175012_n.jpg?oh=723dbb22b051be3c48e8f53d853e96ee&oe=58D762CA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14495323_10155359155613508_1243250795975175012_n.jpg?oh=93b3c9cbca7f4858274223caf32ad7ab&oe=58D7ABC7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155359155613508&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-05T21:40:34+0000	1475703634	2016-10-05 23:40:34	1	18	1	4	23	17	10	7	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was 330g! That should not have happened. I understand that with the whole vegetable it can t be 100% accurate  but then it should be a few grams more  not 50g less! I always check the weight of the products and calculate whether to choose a pack or loose fruit/veggies. But now I see it s pointless. I feel tricked. From now on I will be checking every single pack and will complain every time when I notice that it is less than it says on the label.

Your packaging states  for best results oven cook . What the?? As you can see from pictures below  I wouldn t recommend oven cooking!! No mention from removing from tray  just taking off plastic lid.

Ordered an Acer computer over the phone (as their website would only let me proceed halfway). The girl I spoke to was reluctant to take my order  preferring to spend her time redirecting me back to their website. After explaining to her that the website wasn t working properly she took my order. However  I later discovered that she had given me a different Christian name (Naomi) and a new phone number .??? so my computer was never delivered and is now out of stock. A few days later I had a call from a Tomas (no H in this chaps name) who does the customer service surveys and he had me down as Diane..?  No gesture of good will was offered and no reply to my 4 emails has been received even tho in my first call querying where my computer was the girl I spoke to admitted the original girl was  probably new and needs more training ..  So no point relying on this store to place your order correctly with the correct details you give them as they clearly make it up as they go along and then ignore you... Willnot be recommending their services or shopping in their store again (not that I ll be missed)					2016-10-05T19:02:53+0000	1475694173	2016-10-05 21:02:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He works out his insulin injection according to the carbs in his meal.....food packaging details the fat/salt/sugars etc clearly on the front labels. How about adding a carbs level too? The carbs are per 100g usually (detailed on the back of  a product) not per food item. It would be so much easier for a diabetic to accurately work out an insulin dose.					2016-10-05T18:36:56+0000	1475692616	2016-10-05 20:36:56	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  all is not how it first seemed.  After dreaming about what I was going to have for dinner all day  I decided to tuck into a meal accompanied by broccoli. I removed the packaging  washed and chopped it up  before placing it all in a pot of boiling water. Little did I know that things were about to take a terrible turn.  I checked the broccoli in the pot and much to my horror  I noticed a stowaway - in the form of a üêõ floating lifeless on the top on the pot! I sprung into action and fished him out  but it was too late  he was gone! What a way to go but I m sure you ll agree that he looks peaceful in the picture below!   Needless to say that this whole experience has left myself and my children devastated and our appetite has somewhat diminished. I m sure that when he jumped on board the broccoli train and dreamed of a hot climate  it s far from what he had in mind.  Clearly we want to give him a good send off so any contributions Tesco would like to make towards the little guys funeral would be gratefully received. Besides  every little helps! üòÅ We will of course let you know the date and time of the service so that you can pay your respects.  Yours with sadness  Jen	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14492435_10155354307314816_2298132971306043683_n.jpg?oh=bbb4942ab2899555436e2964114b32ca&oe=58ED1F5E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14492435_10155354307314816_2298132971306043683_n.jpg?oh=f6312e913eaa0a458248348564f0a25b&oe=58DC2F53	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155354307314816&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-05T18:09:04+0000	1475690944	2016-10-05 20:09:04	14	13	25	1	39	10	6	4	7	0	14	1	3	5	2	0	0

I called in  to your Newton-le-Willows/Earlestown store  a few days ago and you had a display complete with games. I picked one up and took it to the till. I was told  after queuing-up  that I couldn t pay for it there and that I needed to go to the cigarette kiosk/click & collect desk - as that s where the games are kept (which seemed fine to me  except for the massive queue  which was being served by one person and that nearly everyone in the queue  aside from myself and some children (also buying FIFA 17)  were cigarette buyers/smokers - i.e. largely stinking of stale cigarette smoke). It took ten minutes to get to the front of the queue. It was at this point  that things really started to take a dark turn. FIFA 17 wasn t in stock for PS4. No explanation was offered as to why the FIFA17 for PS4 boxes were still on the shelves  let alone on a prime location display. Today  I thought I d try again. I called ahead to check FIFA 17 was in stock. I was told there were loads [of copies] (for PS4) on the shelves. I called in. I queued up (this time at the stinky-queued kiosk immediately). I was psyched and excited  finally I thought - only to be told it was out of stock again. A little annoyed  I questioned why the PS4 version boxes were on the shelves - I got a slight apology  and the games were taken down. Now things wouldn t be too bad  except for the fact that  two minutes away from TESCO  on my way home  at a traffic-light I wouldn t have been at - if not for visiting TESCO  some children threw a milkshake at me  which rather completely covered me and my motorbike.   So  my question to you  TESCO  is  is this just some round-about way of sending me a message that you don t want me to play FIFA 17?  - A supremely disappointed (& miffed) Pete					2016-10-05T17:57:59+0000	1475690279	2016-10-05 19:57:59	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m writing to ask you what the hell is happening with your  ideas  wo/man (although juding by some of the combinations I have seen  it ideas could be being drawn out of a hat by a cat at random and fused together.)  I ve seen crisps with a myriad of weird combinations  dark chocolate and red chilli sausages  parsnip crisps with honey paprika  prosecco and elderberry crisps are just to name a few.  Today  I was shopping in one of your stores with my son  Lil Jabari  when I saw a box of  Glittery Shortbread  and I thought I was dreaming... please would you look into your ideas team/pack as it seems they re either having some kind of mid-life crisis or that they are taking some seriously mind-bending psychedelics.  I hope you take this into consideration  and that I shall be seeing a lot more  normal  combinations from you in future.  Thanks for your time.

Customers have this habit of saying disabled toilet etc. You can use the word to describe a person as disabled. However a disabled toilet or disabled parking bay? A toilet for the disabled or a parking bay for the disabled to park their vehicle sounds a better description. If you think about it you ll see that I m right. Unfortunately many won t take any notice of this and will continue to use this expression in their wa but not in my way.					2016-10-05T15:49:11+0000	1475682551	2016-10-05 17:49:11	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased a bed through your website with one of your partner company s  Comfy Living. They intially delivered two of three required boxes 13 days ago. Today after the third day of promising by Comfy Living that the missing box Would be delivered it has not been. It s safe to say Comfy Living could care less and every time we speak To them they just lie to our faces that the item Will be delivered. Today I was assured it would be here by 2.30. Then 3.30 and now at 4.16 there is still no bed and all the company could say was  it s the couriers fault. They are essentially holding me hostage. My daughter is sleeping on the floor  I haven t the money to replace the bed and they have no intention of Delivering it. How is this acceptable Tesco? That you give this company a platform to treat your customers Like this? I will not be using Tesco for anything again. I urge everyone to avoid Comfy Living at all costs. They are inept at best and liars at worse. I am gutted for my daughter. This hAs really ruined the experience Of moving to our new house for her.					2016-10-05T15:19:57+0000	1475680797	2016-10-05 17:19:57	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday around 12:30pm just before leaving the store I had returned an item  I then walked around looking at a few products such as make-up. I had also purchased some snacks. After paying for my items I walked towards the exit to leave the store  however the alarm went off and I was immediately stopped by two male security guards. They requested to look through my belongings and they had asked me to empty my bag within the front store open to the public. Firstly they were not allowed to search me in front of the public. They in fact had to do a search behind closed doors. After the security guards found nothing they continued to accuse me and asked what make-up did I ‚Äòsteal‚Äô. In shock I explained exactly what I done within the store  I had returned an item  looked at a few products for a short period of time followed by purchasing some snacks. I expressed that I did not steal anything as it is not in my nature to do such a thing. A friend of mine had come entered the store and saw what was going on  he insisted on helping me and he was also shocked that they would make such accusations. After thoroughly searching my bag the security guards were still not satisfied so they therefore called for another security guard who had then escorted me and my friend to an isolated room where they could do a further search. I felt so embarrassed and they made me feel so petite. I could not believe that they would accuse me of stealing. Stealing or being dishonest is something that is not in my heart and I would never even consider the thought of stealing anything from anyone. I am a hard working and a religious girl. I was in tears that they had continued to accuse me.   After bringing me to an isolated room  another male security guard had further searched my bag  belongings and my jacket. I felt even more embarrassed that a male security guard would go through my belongings especially that I am a female and I carry around products for female and personal reasons. After their second attempt to search me they found nothing  however they still continued to accuse me of stealing ‚Äúmake-up‚Äù  they asked ‚Äúwhere did you put the make-up‚Äù they also stated that it was a white item. In tears I continued to express that I would never steal anything. For almost the fifth time I explained that I had returned an item and the only thing that I had placed within my own bag was the receipt from the item I had returned. They stated that they monitored me throughout my time in the store  so there is no way they could assume that I would place a stolen item elsewhere. They came to realisation that I did not steal an item and they were willing to let me go  I was so upset  disappointed and frustrated that I wanted to make a complaint for how unprofessional this situation was dealt with. The security guard called in the store manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô  after he assessed the video he also accused me of stealing an item. My friend was just as frustrated and shocked as myself; therefore he requested to see the security footage. The security guards and the store manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô allowed my friend to view the security footage. After my friend watched the security footage he did notice that I had put something into my bag  he immediately expressed that it does not look anything like an item or a product whatsoever  in fact he agreed that it was a paper material ‚Äòthe receipt‚Äô that I had continuously expressed to the security guards. My friend was so frustrated that they had wasted our time for making the biggest mistake. The manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô and security guards were very opinionated that a product was stolen. The ‚Äòmanager‚Äô stated that they would normally inform the police to do a search. My response from the very beginning was to inform the police  I told them many times to call a female police officer to do another full search. I had no problems whatsoever with informing the police. I know how valuable a police officer‚Äôs time is  and if they did call the police they would have wasted their time too. The manager was willing to let us go as they could not find a product that they thought was stolen.   The manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô did apologise to an extent that this was a misunderstanding on their behalf. At this point I felt relieved that he was taking ownership for their mistakes  however he made a very sarcastic comment by saying ‚Äúin my opinion  it looks like you have picked up a product and placed it into your bag.‚Äù I then realised that he did not mean his apology as he continued to accuse me. I felt even more upset. The two security guards did not want to acknowledge that they were in the wrong and not at any point did they want to take ownership for their mistakes. To top this off and to make things even more embarrassing a crowd of ‚ÄòTesco‚Äô employees from different departments were standing and watching from outside the room I was interrogated in. The door was wide open for the employees to watch and pretend as if they were doing work in a security office. This was very irrelevant  unprofessional and shameful. The feeling was even more unbearable. After me and my friend were free to leave  as there was no stolen item and I was undoubtedly innocent. As I walked out I felt so out of place that they had accused me of being a criminal. After I was searched I left with the exact same items that I had purchased and all my belongings that I brought into the store. After passing through the security ‚Äòalarm‚Äô by the exit  no alarms had gone off  they therefore intentionally turned on the alarms from when I was previously leaving the store. It made no sense  for someone to steal a make-up product there is no doubt that the alarms will go off. This therefore justifies that I did not steal anything.   After leaving the store I had called Tesco‚Äôs head office to make a complaint. I spoke to a kind lady and I thoroughly addressed my complaint expressing every detail possible. She immediately apologised for what had happened and she had agreed that this was very unprofessional. She also informed me that something will be done about this  as this is not the service Tesco provide. She insisted that she will get down to the bottom of this situation and contact me as soon as possible. It has been 24 hours and I still await for her call. I will now be contacting the ‚Äòombudsman‚Äô to make a further complaint.  I am extremely dissatisfied with how this was dealt with. It was very unprofessional  and I felt so embarrassed about what had happened. Tesco Extra in Goodmayes is my local grocery store  I shop there on a weekly basis and sometimes I come in as often as a five times per week. I have a lot of  family  friends and work colleagues who also shop at Tesco‚Äôs. A work colleague of mine also saw what had happened. I was so embarrassed that I did not go into work today as everyone will know what happened in the event that took place yesterday. Although I did nothing wrong I would never want people I know to even think that I would ever committee such a disgusting crime. The event that happened yesterday has left me so upset that I no longer feel comfortable shopping at Tesco‚Äôs Goodmayes. Firstly due to the security guards and the manager for how they treated me  also the random employees who decided to watch and for those I personally know who may have saw the incident.   As a customer I did not feel as if I was respected by the security guards or the manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô. Never could I imagine I would receive such poor and unprofessional behaviour from Tesco‚Äôs and its employees  one of the leading stores in the UK.					2016-10-05T15:16:33+0000	1475680593	2016-10-05 17:16:33	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

There didn t even seem to be a price sticker on the shelf where they used to be. Also  the new store layout is bizarre: why have tinned kidney beans and tomatoes moved to a section near the herbs instead of in the  Tinned vegetables  section where they belong? Had me and another customer walking in circles looking for them. Not at all intuitive. Was told the decision came from  corporate ... clearly made by someone who has someone else do their shopping for them.	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQB9cU3JMk5aoFm3&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.tesco.com%2FGroceries%2Fpi%2F363%2F5054269711363%2FIDShot_225x225.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQAttMxWFNO4nCD1	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCjnLdWb5rgs1Yy&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.tesco.com%2FGroceries%2Fpi%2F363%2F5054269711363%2FIDShot_225x225.jpg&_nc_hash=AQBCOmkCNtmwC9YL	http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=289553761	tesco.com	2016-10-05T15:14:56+0000	1475680496	2016-10-05 17:14:56	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is tired looking  often with strewn rubbish and needs the bays etc repainting. It just looks like that no one has any pride anymore by working there.  Definitely more emphasis should be given to the disabled bay signs.  Often there is not one to spare because non-disabled people prefer to use them because they are close to the store and there is no deterrent if they use them. They know that nothing can be done to them.  An employee told me that  Tesco s can do nothing as  they are  courtesy  bays.  Why bother to have them if nothing can be done to keep them free for the disabled?					2016-10-05T13:47:45+0000	1475675265	2016-10-05 15:47:45	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I buy plums which are very dry and tasteless  apples which are soft and tasteless  peaches and nectarines which are  ripen at home  but the next day when I go to eat one  half will already be covered in mould. I don t store fruit near any bananas as I know that can cause premature ripening  but to buy a punnet of fruit and find it has a one or two day use by time  and then it literally is mouldy  is very annoying. I love fruit  but really am fed up with throwing so much of it away. I don t even buy apples anymore because I can never find a firm  crispy AND tasty one any more.					2016-10-05T12:38:56+0000	1475671136	2016-10-05 14:38:56	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

At 5.10pm called to check upon the whereabouts of the order and after being promised a call back  which never happened  I called again at approximately 6pm to be told that the driver could not find the address  did not ring me on my mobile number detailed on the order and returned the Berwick store. I requested the order be cancelled and a refund be actioned.  I was advised this would take 3-4 working days.  I did receive a call from the store late morning on Sunday 25 September stating that they may be able to delivery in the afternoon/evening  despite my instruction the previous evening to cancel and refund the order.  Again I requested the order be cancelled and refund and was advised it would take 5-7 working days to refund?  Sent an email to this effect to your Customer Service on Monday 3/10/16 and received a call earlier this afternoon to say that the refund had never be actioned but it would now and could take another 3-5 days?   I have to say that I have been very disappointed at the service received at this time.  I have placed several grocery orders  over the last 5-6 years  that have been delivered to remote addresses and have had no problems/delays until now.  Due to the appalling bad service received  for any future food deliveries  we will NOT be using Tesco again!!!!  Hearing members of staff apologise time and again for the non-delivery/non-refund does not actually help!!!					2016-10-05T11:37:25+0000	1475667445	2016-10-05 13:37:25	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought my lunch and other groceries for my tea including strawberries and raspberries to which my bill came to ¬£20 but i was not given a receipt!  Upon opening the strawberries (that were dated 6th October) they looked OK until I picked them up to wash them  they were all very squishy and mushy and some had white fur on them. Although I was annoyed that I had only bought them today and they were all rotten  I thought to myself I cant be bothered to complain about a tub of strawberries I ll just throw them away  Until I decided to open the raspberries dated the 5th October instead  when I peeled back the top there was a few that were mushy and also some that turned in mush as I was rinsing them  so I picked out the ones that looked and felt OK. After having poured half the tub in a bowl and eaten a handful  I looked down and noticed 1 raspberry in particular started to move  I first thought it was water from when I rinsed them until I looked closer to find what I can only describe as a tiny maggots!  So I checked the rest that was in the bowl to find they were ALL riddled with these maggots! (Please see pictures below  I transferred these to darker surface so you can see better)  I am really disappointed after spending my money on your food that I can not eat  and as i mentioned above I had already ate a handful of your infested raspberries so now I am distressed and was left feeling really Sick!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14563380_10153861882817155_8435007943208076923_n.jpg?oh=782a93ae598395ac36e319e44fcdc296&oe=58E04570	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14563380_10153861882817155_8435007943208076923_n.jpg?oh=98f0f686ecd354457cf8ca447ac56f5f&oe=58EB587D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153861882817155&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-05T11:35:08+0000	1475667308	2016-10-05 13:35:08	2	41	10	0	51	28	13	15	4	0	2	0	6	0	0	2	0

I phoned up a couple of months ago. Several weeks later I received 2 separate mailings of identical cards with an incorrect initial and the details of my address containing mistakes. I rang back and the corrected details were noted. That was some time ago and I STILL haven t received the correct card. This is a silly scheme whose cost would be better spent on higher staff wages and lower prices at the till.					2016-10-05T10:02:42+0000	1475661762	2016-10-05 12:02:42	0	11	0	0	11	11	2	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been unable to find this original post so am  reposting.  I have since contacted the customer service and have received a refund in full.  My complaint still remains that over the last 4 years or so since being a member of the delivery saver every time I have had a refund by the driver it has never been refunded to my account  I have always had to phone the customer service department to get it sorted out.  Is it just me or every customer that this happens to  if so Tescos must be making a lot of money from people not receiving what they are entitled to.  The Tesco branch that delivers my orders is Tower park  Poole  Dorset.					2016-10-05T08:55:48+0000	1475657748	2016-10-05 10:55:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been into your Durham road branch today and after asking for a sausage bun and a breakfast to go was told  sorry we can t butter your bap   when I asked why I was told that I could butter my own and given a choice of flora or butter ? What madness is this ? I asked for a breakfast not a diy kit ? I suggest you do something before the notion catches on and spreads to the aisles ? What next ? People opening loaves and packets of Ham  in the aisles because the cafe said we could do it our selves ? And why not brekkie at a fiver pop (really really dry bacon burnt  sausages that had been left on too long and had gone a dry rusty colour but mushrooms were fresh hash brown and black pudding were nice ) and sausage bun with offending sausages but nice bun minus bacon - what are yous playing at ? Yous get at least 400 plus pounds out of my small family 1 adult 1 child and a dog each month and I ve just spent another 110 in store - is this how you treat your customers ? It s insulting ? I asked the cashier why she couldn t do it and she said it was the risk of contamination which is absolute rubbish there were oil and dairy products everywhere - including cakes made with both oil and butter in the cabinet what exactly is being eliminated here  apart from customer service ?

Let s be frank: no one likes an overdone pain au chocolat do they? Except maybe your staff at the Tesco Express Compton Acres in Nottingham. They seem to love all kinds of burnt baked goods. If I ever need a disappointing breakfast  I know exactly where to go. Thanks!					2016-10-05T08:21:07+0000	1475655667	2016-10-05 10:21:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These were picked for my delivery last saturday afternoon and although been stored correctly this is what it looks like yesturday. Disgusting. I dont know who if anyone at the tesco kingston park store knows how to stock rotate but this is shocking. Needless to say i will buy my onions from elsewhere.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14516615_10206271054609159_2511372118510059914_n.jpg?oh=c51e2ea5b6a1d462b3e13641b83126a8&oe=5922575C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14516615_10206271054609159_2511372118510059914_n.jpg?oh=391f50256f0df17d6c0e9a11e6aaec64&oe=58E3C151	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206271054609159&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-05T08:07:49+0000	1475654869	2016-10-05 10:07:49	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought it was because of the environment and landfill and plastic bags not being bio degradable!  So when doing my food shopping online to click and collect i tick the pack my shopping with bags just to make my life easier for once. It was a weekly shop for my household of 5 so it was pretty big!  Now my normal weekly shop i manage to get in about 5-6 reusable shopping bags. Whilst putting my shopping in the car i couldnt help but think it was packed in alot of bags!  When i got home i counted the bags  some of which only had one item in them  there was 28 bags in total!  Now i dont care about paying 5p for a bag its not about that its more about the fact the government put in this rule to stop us wasting and harming the environment but what penalty is there for big companies like tesco over using the plastic bags! I mean 28 plastic bags and at least 10 of them had one item in!  In future i shall make sure i check the without bags box when shopping on line!					2016-10-05T04:39:29+0000	1475642369	2016-10-05 06:39:29	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I picked up some cat food which was damaged and leaked all over me ruining my top and watch. After 3 trips to customer service over the space of an hour I was promised this would be followed up Monday. They advised to have my watch professionally cleaned  this service doesn t exist. Nobody called back yesterday. I called yesterday evening and spoke to Chris in Dundee who assured me someone would call me back today at the latest and would look into compensating me  he lied  no one called me back. I called again today and got through to Steve in Borehamwood who said I d have to file an insurance claim! What has this to do with me making a formal complaint regarding the incident and the poor service I received? He said I d be called back tomorrow  I won t hold my breath. I m disappointed and disgusted at such a poor level of service and mainly being fobbed off. I spend on average between ¬£50-70 a week in tesco not including fuel and other products roughly ¬£3000 a year  my mother spends over ¬£6000 a year we are both probably going to shop elsewhere now due to the blatant disregard to this situation. I m left with an expensive watch I can t currently wear due to the stench  thanks tesco!					2016-10-04T21:45:23+0000	1475617523	2016-10-04 23:45:23	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My five year old son by baby and I were choosing their daddy s. Birthday cake when my son took a bad turn with his asthma . I got him onto a seat and where he literally passed out.  whilst settling my daughter and calling for someone to help This lady came over with cold compresses and talked to me. She kept me calm  chatted with my baby girl and was so caring . When we were collected she was concerned and asked if I would let her know how he was. She was genuinely emotional. He is now home from hospital and asleep In his bed.

Sent us emails throughout the day telling us our orders were ready to collect  so when my partner went to collect them at about ten past eight (our only free time after children s extra curricular activities and tea etc)  he was told because he was ten minutes late he was not able to pick up the orders! Apparently you can only collect orders up until eight o clock (not once were we told this!) and my partner was snootily informed he would have to come back tomorrow. I m sorry Tesco  we have jobs and responsibilities during the day (perhaps I should cancel my daughter s doctors appointment as you evidently think we should be picking up an order instead!!!) Bearing in mind one of the orders was a replacement of an original order which arrived swathed in bubblewrap yet the box was so battered it was rendered completely useless as a gift!!! I think I ll be taking our custom elsewhere in future!!					2016-10-04T20:09:06+0000	1475611746	2016-10-04 22:09:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to have a little mumble about one of your pasta carbonara bakes my husband purchased at your Lee Mill store yesterday!  Since I had an accident back in January and being stuck on crutches for the past 9months myself and my husband have been purchasing more  ready meals  than we would normally. Your pasta carbonara bake being one of the most popular meals of choice and we have it around once a week!  However  we were really disappointed with this one......we had massive lumps of broccoli stalks! Some stalks had a meagre floret or two  some were just lumps of stalk!!! It s the first time we ve encountered this problem  maybe a fault on your processing line?! But it did spoil our supper a tad!! üòî	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14469544_10209880498106240_2164768885737198330_n.jpg?oh=c3ce8e2adbb6de4055d867bd87755de9&oe=58D7A777	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14469544_10209880498106240_2164768885737198330_n.jpg?oh=6c8638f42cf28c875f45002f0b753963&oe=591A117A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209880498106240&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-04T19:57:25+0000	1475611045	2016-10-04 21:57:25	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This car was parked in a disabled space by a member of your staff just after 7.30pm tonight (not displaying a blue badge).

On Sunday I ordered a LEGO Classic Large Creative Box 10697 from Tesco to collect from my local Tesco garage.  I was told both before and after the order:  You can collect your order after 3pm on 3/10/2016.    I received an email at 06:24 on the 3rd saying  We have just dispatched your order 4D4G6HMYF.   I drove to the garage immediately after work  but when I got there at about 16.45  the member of staff rumaged around in the storeroom and came back saying that they could not trace the package  and that I would need to phone customer services.  When I got back home I phoned customer services and spoke to an assistant called Mohammed. I explained what had happened  and he was courteous and polite.  He checked with the courier company s website and said that Tesco had failed given the courier the package. I pointed out that at no point had Tesco contacted me to tell me the package was not actually on the way and that I had had a thirty minute round journey in vain.  He apologised for (as he put it) the cowardice of Tesco s not informing me that the packet was not on the way and offered to send another packet  but now that it was after 5pm he could not promise that it would arrive today (the 4th).    I have received no further email and looked at the website this evening and still can only see the original dispatch on the 3rd.  I am not planning on driving over to the garage tonight in the vain hope that it has arrived undocumented.  I can only hope it will arrive tomorrow  because my son keeps on asking where it is.  This is not the first time.  A couple of years ago they claimed to have left a crate of wine in my garden  which never came (and they could not describe where they had left it)  then when they tried again  they claimed noone was in  even though I had stayed in all day  so I assume on both occasions the delivery driver went to some other address.  As I told Mohammed  if I don t get the Lego tomorrow  I shall try to find it locally and shall send them the bill.  Tesco offers a good discount  so it will end up more expensive  but it is the only reasonable way that I can have my contract with them fulfilled.  Hopefully it will not come to that and if it does hopefully they will pay up immediately rather than forcing me to escalate the complaint up the management chain  though the ombudsman  and ultimately through the small claims process. It is shameful to give such shoddy service  especially for products that they must know children are likely to be looking forward to.					2016-10-04T19:37:08+0000	1475609828	2016-10-04 21:37:08	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am referring to the Tesco Express store in Uplands  Swansea  SA2 0EY where I shop regularly. Today I went in to buy a few top up shopping needs and was pulled aside by a lady who works there regularly who told me the duty manager wanted to speak to me about some unpaid goods. I was a bit incredulous about this to start with as I am a very honest person  not that this should make the blindest bit of difference to the situation. The duty manager came out and said that I had only paid for half of my shopping on a previous in store occasion. Apparently the cashier had put through that I had paid half in cash and half on my card and I had dishonestly not made them aware of this. I would wholeheartedly agree that it would be unusual  though not unheard of  for me to pay half my bill in cash and half on card  but I would never not correct a mistake of this kind. In fact there have been previous occasions when I have corrected the cashier for undercharging me. The duty manager couldn t tell me when this allegedly happened  but said he would show me a receipt to prove it had happened. After leafing through papers for a good five minutes  he told me that he had been unable to find the offending receipt and that I was free to go.  I was really offended that this entire exchange played out in front of a shop full of people  many of whom I knew. I was accused of having done something dishonest without the slightest bit of proof. I ve shopped in this store for two years  probably spending in excess of ¬£75 per week and I m completely put off visiting again. The service has never been good there- it s not unheard of to spend five minutes waiting for alcohol purchases to be authorised  to be told to just use the self service machines if the girl behind the counter is restocking cigarettes  to have to navigate around the orders that always seem to be put away during the morning and evening rush hour etc  but this has really upset me.  May I suggest that if this incident even happened in the first place that the store firstly takes responsibility for their cashier s mistake and further to this  if they do want to pursue it with me that they have  the evidence  to hand instead of making me wait red faced in front of a shop of my acquaintances having essentially been accused of stealing. I am an honest person- had I realised I had been undercharged I would have mentioned it  but if it did happen the way they allege it did  it was certainly without my realising.   I m really disappointed. You would expect better customer service from a retail giant like Tesco.					2016-10-04T19:23:58+0000	1475609038	2016-10-04 21:23:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received an email to say my order had arrived and I was free to collect. I headed down to the customer service desk today at 2.40 and spoke to a lady called deb  gave her my order number and off she trotted to retrieve said order. She brought my 3 items back (eventually) and scanned them  but then refused to give me one of the packages as she couldn t find my name anywhere on it (even tho she got it from the store with my name on it) spent the next 30 minutes looking for another package (no idea why when she had opened said package and it had my order in it) she then collared another woman who also looked for my package in the cupboards and in the back store (all while my package was sat behind the desk that deb had refused to give me) then eventually came back checked the package behind the desk saw that it did in fact have my name on and gave me it! No apology no nothing! All this happened with me repeatedly asking for the package that I had already ordered and paid for which was sat behind the counter and telling them I needed to leave to collect my son from school and was met with being completely ignored! Not once did she answer me! In the end I left the store at 3.15 making me late to collect my son from school! Fuming doesn t even come close!					2016-10-04T19:08:30+0000	1475608110	2016-10-04 21:08:30	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last week we brought a punnet of your grapes and the day before the use by date they went all mouldy. Giving the benefit of the doubt  we went shopping two days ago and got a large punnet of your raspberries they have the use by date of 5th October and this morning the 4th of October when I woke up to lavish on some sweet and juicy raspberries what a guess are all mouldy üò™. Please Tesco could you explain how this is acceptable? Please do not tell me I should forward think my life to eat everything a day before the use by date  it does not help that the date choices are absolutely appalling in store! Very upset and reconsidering going back to coop for our shopping!					2016-10-04T18:29:58+0000	1475605798	2016-10-04 20:29:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just over a month out of warranty. We tried everything suggested and different chargers incase maybe hudl charger was broken but nothing worked. I sent email on 26th September 2016 and was requested to send  pictures of usb port and receipt details. I did than and had no reply. So i decides to call helpline today. He basically told me to take it to my local store they would call the support team and go though some checks and they would decide from there if its worth sending away to repair or if they would give us a voucher if they cannot fix it.  I was quite shocked  when he said that we wouldn t get a full refund as it out of warranty but just over a month! He said that products like this lose value after 6 months and I would be lucky to get ¬£50. Even though this a known fault with the tablets etc.  I will never buy another tesco brand tablet or appliance again.

It s bad enough when you mix your metric units on a single product. for example Kg and Grams on the cheese. But most people can work that one out! But it s still not good as there are a few people who can t even do that type of simple arithmetic.   However I just went in to Milton Cambridge Tesco and was surprised to find grapes  one packaging marked with the price per Kg and a different packaging marked in imperial pounds and ounces.  Now if I was the type of person to be cynical I would think it s a con to make the larger package seem to be less expensive as I suspect trading standards would.  My mental arithmetic does not run to converting metric to imperial weight  Ask around your office and see if any of you can?   When did we stop teaching imperial units in school?? I left school in 1971 and we were using metric then.  You really need to get this sorted and have a common unit for at least the same products. In the ideal world you should have everything displayed with a price per Kg or gm.					2016-10-04T17:33:48+0000	1475602428	2016-10-04 19:33:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It would be great if you introduced similar trolleys to this and offered the boxes shown as an alternative to bags for life. A box for life if you will. You can just throw the stuff in as you scan and have a box for cupboards and one for fridge and frozen etc and they would get easy to load and unload into the car lol you could even have 2 box trolley versions for those that do little shops	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14590333_10157475816440024_3782380662712457690_n.jpg?oh=fd0ac5293e77b481d963c5f6b267722e&oe=58E20326	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14590333_10157475816440024_3782380662712457690_n.jpg?oh=eb9891924befb9f3ee483f959dfc87f1&oe=591FC881	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157475816440024&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-04T17:33:05+0000	1475602385	2016-10-04 19:33:05	2	20	2	0	22	20	4	16	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently brought a 400g tin of Aptamil pepti 2 from you which cost ¬£10.89  i then went ahead an ordered a larger 800g tin which i went to collect today thinking it would be around  ¬£18. Imagine my surprise when i am charged ¬£33 for it!!! After questioning it i was informed that you buy it for ¬£18 and then mutiply it by 1.8! Absolutely distugusted that you make so much money from my daughters milk allergy and even more frustrating that i was charged  trade  price in the first place and then full price next time. If it wasn t for the fact i am leaving for a weeks holiday tonight i would have not brought it. I shall no longer be shopping at your stores as i absolutely can not condone such a huge amount of profit being made from a medical condition.... espically one in a baby!					2016-10-04T16:51:20+0000	1475599880	2016-10-04 18:51:20	0	8	0	0	8	8	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I dreaded my appointment with baby and toddler in tow but the staff were lovely; offered me a private room to breastfeed in whilst waiting to be seen  kindly waited when I had to take the toddler to the toilet mid-check and even helped engage him whilst I was having my eyes checked by letting him dim the lights. Very friendly  very professional and free! Will be recommending Rav and his team to everyone.					2016-10-04T14:58:59+0000	1475593139	2016-10-04 16:58:59	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A family member went today as offer ends tomorrow she went to 2 different tesco stores. Firstly she went to your store in Leith  Edinburgh   where she was told they were not sent in the mini binders but had the cards  so she got the cards and was told to go another branch. She then went out to your store in Corstorphine to be told by a rude member of staff that they were not sent in there either to get then told it states while stocks last where my family member said yes that s right but you need to be sent them first for that to happen. After spending money on bus fares to these 2 stores she wasn t travelling any further. My question is why negotiate a deal for an offer that we cannot get cos you did not send the binders into the stores. They were large extra stores she went too. Is there anywhere that does have these that she can go get as it is for my son. I look forward to a prompt reply since we have cards but no binder!

Bought a pair of noisy paw patrol slippers for my excited 2 year old son only for them to stop working the next day. Go back to the store and they dont have his size and refuse to order them in without me paying for them again.i cant take the broken pair away from my son or he cries so unless i put my hand in my pocket again it cant be resolved. I dont see why they couldnt be brought into the store and then swapped over  especially as theyre faulty.

She has been so helpful and kind today. I called to close my Mums clubcard account as she passed away. Michelle arranged for the points from my Mums clubcard to be transferred to my clubcardcard and even called me back twice (first time she left a message) to confirm it was all done. My mum passed away a few weeks ago and I have called and spoken to many companies over the past few weeks and none of the people I talked to have been as lovely and friendly and helpful as Michelle was today.  Great customer service from you  it often goes unnoticed so I just wanted to say thanks.  She really cheered me up too.

At 9:30 last night I was on the phone to customer services who couldn t get in touch with the driver or the store  bearing in mind my delivery was scheduled between 7-8pm! My children were still awake past their bedtimes waiting which has completely disrupted our routine this morning.   I was offered a ¬£20 voucher and free delivery as this is the 3rd time in a row my delivery has arrived late!   I ended up changing delivery to this morning between 8-9am lets see if it arrives.					2016-10-04T07:32:53+0000	1475566373	2016-10-04 09:32:53	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I track my order it was dispatched from Fennylock FC late on 30/09/16 but there has been no sign of it since then.

I cannot fault the customer care I received from your transport manager Marcus  as he dealt with the situation well and took full responsibility of the accident and gave clear instructions to both me and the driver to resolve the issue of my damaged car.   It took the company 2 weeks from this date to come and collect my car for repair. As promised I received a courtesy car  which was supposed to be a like for like comparison to my car (Honda jazz). I received a 4 seater smart car. This car is very small and is not very spacious at all. The two back seats are only able to fit children.  This has made it very difficult to make trips in this car  as I have a disabled sister and a mum who suffers from arthritis  neither of which can sit in the back of the car without causing pain or discomfort. I have therefore had to rearrange plans and rely on taxis  or friends and family for lifts out. I drove the car to do my weekly shop and put my shopping in the boot. I was not made aware when given the car that the engine was under the boot space and this would become warm when driving  resulting in me loosing most of my frozen goods bought on that day. Furthermore the smart car I currently have is now due a service and does not have any screen wash in. I would expect all this to be checked before lending out the car.  The GC South company that have taken my car for repair have now had my car for 12 days and not once updated me on the progress of the repairs. I had to phone them myself on 28th September to ask how much longer it would be for the repairs to my car will be complete as an email I received stated that the completion date is the 29th September. I still have not received my car and it is 3rd October. My car is due in for a mot in 7 days‚Äô time and I cannot book it in until I can guarantee I have received my car back.   All this would not be so much of an issue if I only had this car for a short amount of time  but it has now been a 4 weeks and 3 days since the incident happened and it has not been dealt with very quickly  causing great inconvenience and stress.   I have also tried talking to people in your bursledon store who said they will look into things and contact me by 6pm tonight as to when I will receive my car back and why no one is communicating with each other and myself but this also hasn t happened!   I look forward to hearing from you about this. Kerry Harder					2016-10-03T22:33:26+0000	1475534006	2016-10-04 00:33:26	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had to go into store to ask for the post code so that recovery knew where I was. The staff on shift were so lovely and friendly. They let me use the loo and sit in the staff room while I was waiting so that I didn t get cold. They even offered me a coffee. As a young woman out on my own in the dark this was so lovely and made me feel safe. A massive thank you to all the staff for looking out for me. A little kindness goes a long way.					2016-10-03T21:59:44+0000	1475531984	2016-10-03 23:59:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

(It is OK when using the normal tills). Out of principle I took my receipts (3 in total) into Infirmary Road  Sheffield branch to be credited.  I was served by a pleasant young guy.  Whilst adding my points I asked is it normal that the self-service tills don‚Äôt accept my clubcard and why this would be the case.  Straight away an old woman (store manager I believe who was watching over the young guy rudely interrupted and chirped in we can only do 2 receipts at a time. I explained my situation to her and she accused me of being fraudulent (even though the last receipt was only for 1 point!! Again it‚Äôs principle and more over I would like to have known why my card is not working correctly.) The woman  who identified herself as Karen Jackson said it wasn‚Äôt her problem and I should revisit the stores I can‚Äôt use my clubcard at and ask them.  Now presently I‚Äôm living in Sheffield so to drive to Dundee store is 320 miles then onto Glossop store is 297 miles and back to where I am staying is 25 miles  totalling 642 miles.  I charge 45 pence /mile totalling ¬£288.90.  I am an Airline captain and my daily rate is ¬£450 per day  which I believe the whole journey will take about a day to complete.  I also charge ¬£5 for lunch and ¬£15 for an evening meal.  Could you please arrange for a cheque to be sent totalling ¬£758.90 so I complete as requested by your employee Karen Jackson.  This besides I still believe after my journey it will be no clearer why my clubcard does not work whenever I‚Äôm not interfacing with a human. I find the rudeness and lack of customer care represented by Karen Jackson to fall well short of that expected by a huge international company.  I have not experienced such shortfalls with Sainsburys  Morrison and Waitrose and their loyalty stores cards have always worked as intended.					2016-10-03T20:19:35+0000	1475525975	2016-10-03 22:19:35	2	8	2	0	10	8	3	5	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why don t you buy them off farmers in England  you can grow them here all year round in poly tunnels.					2016-10-03T20:12:51+0000	1475525571	2016-10-03 22:12:51	3	5	3	0	8	5	2	3	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I used a new car seat that stays in the car for my baby. I parked in the baby/toddler parking. These spaces are useful and appreciated. I wasn t best pleased however  to discover your trollies suitable to place my baby in  are on the other side of the store. I had to walk straight past the normal  trollies and the entrance  almost the length of the store  with a baby and child in toe before I reached the suitable trolley for us.  I would suggest that you keep the baby seated trollies closer to the baby/toddler parking spaces. Or a least some of them. I don t really fancy a mini trek everytime I go shopping!					2016-10-03T19:52:04+0000	1475524324	2016-10-03 21:52:04	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having gone in there tonight to do my weekly shop as always. To have found PlayStation 4 on offer for ¬£149 and labels out to purchase this item ( see pic) I then pursued to go to tesco direct to buy my purchase (as stated on the ticket) lovely lady on the desk checked on the computer and informed me that they WERE in stock and it would be ¬£249.99! Not ¬£149 as the A4 poster said on the shelf. I then said no thank you I ll wait to see if a better deal comes along   Still puzzled by this error by tesco I then went to customer service (approx 15mins later) and asked if I could have one of the PlayStation 4 console with Fifa 17 on the ¬£149 as displayed with hundreds of labels next to it to buy. she was gone no more than 2 mins and told me there was none in stock! So you could imagine my confusion when I was informed they were in stock by one customer assistant to then be told there was none in stock!  I am really disappointed as to why I feel I am being lied to. And as my pictures quite clearly state to me they were in stock.  1) why is there no  out of stock label  ?  2) why was I informed they were in stock but just at ¬£249.99? 3) why was there hundreds of labels for customers to purchase this product?!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14463176_10210313029599429_372297218247127538_n.jpg?oh=13e7796c1924ba705cbb8c4aea56653f&oe=58D8D882	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14463176_10210313029599429_372297218247127538_n.jpg?oh=e29259c7aa7c42e1a7144afbb59dca49&oe=58E2C697	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210313029599429&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-03T19:36:12+0000	1475523372	2016-10-03 21:36:12	0	3	1	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Not impressed though as there was absolutely no signage to explain the disruption. Took me ages and I probably spent more trying to find what I wanted in the chilled isle.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14523148_10207873739345970_7161419372773975166_n.jpg?oh=33e469b2b88f62513531487efcb3f8d7&oe=58DB16EB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14523148_10207873739345970_7161419372773975166_n.jpg?oh=1862725e8487bef3829f3d17225d1f6e&oe=591F0DE6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207873739345970&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-03T18:27:59+0000	1475519279	2016-10-03 20:27:59	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

That on top of the ¬£40 minimum spend is making it very hard to shop at tesco.					2016-10-03T18:22:27+0000	1475518947	2016-10-03 20:22:27	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

NONE of your employees came over to help  even hearing my son screaming (first 10 seconds he wasn t actually breathing due to the impact of his fall!!!)   My son has been complaining of back ache and now has come up in bruising !   I am shocked at the lack of customer service or just common decency from your employees who were more worried of me paying for my purchases then my sons wellbeing and injury from something that wasn t cleared up on the floor in your store !!  I will attach a picture of the bruising!   I apologise for the picture s poor quality.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14516376_10154632760791151_3721216715927312714_n.jpg?oh=bef302fabbd52dee7834874bc9cb852d&oe=59213D5C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14516376_10154632760791151_3721216715927312714_n.jpg?oh=af35768625def8ebb6d61fd2d3a4f243&oe=591A0551	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154632760791151&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-03T18:17:57+0000	1475518677	2016-10-03 20:17:57	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The whole batch or most of it in this shop and Crooksfoot are the same  threads sticking out here there and everywhere  damaged seams. This is such a shame  the poor craftsman ship that has gone into these shirts  as they are beautiful. I d bought one as a gift.It s such a shame that customers are thought so little of that even when clothes are brought back due to poor quality that they are put straight back out for someone else to buy. There was a customer looking to buy this shirt  until I explained to her and showed her the poor quality. I will certainly think twice about buying clothes from here after this disappointing experience  which is a shame as I usually buy a lot of clothes here for both myself and grandparents.I attach a photo which doesn t really do the issue justice.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14595732_10154328911770033_8665911711389460498_n.jpg?oh=e5fcfc2582a5146dccd76ab0cfa1d212&oe=58ED3776	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14595732_10154328911770033_8665911711389460498_n.jpg?oh=2ab6a366e687e2ae0a71c225a1698a57&oe=58F0157B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154328911770033&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-03T17:54:00+0000	1475517240	2016-10-03 19:54:00	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Monday mornings are always a bit stressful when you r a busy mum of 3 and extras (I m a childminder).  Whilst fishing around in my bag earlier on today for that elusive pound coin and with a 1 year old attached to my hip a lovely trolley girls came up to me and asked if I needed any help. My reply being  I m fine I just need to pop inside to get change for the trolley . Her reply   No need to do that I can unlock the trolley for you .  Something so small to others made a huge difference to my morning!! With baby all secured in the trolley we walk straight to the fruit and veg where the baby spotted the bananas . This being her favourite word at the moment as well as  yellow  she repeatedly told me what they were in a very excited manner. A lovely manager who was in the process of restocking as led me if she liked bananas which I replied yes too. He then took the time to look through the pre packed bananas   opened them and offered me the bunch to pick one for her. There were loose ones on the stand but were obviously  the ones that people had left so rather than offering me one of those which still would have been a lovely gesture he hunted for a fresher bunch!! These two kind gestures together made what was normally quite a stressful experience on a Monday morning a lot more pleasurable !!!  Thankyou Tesco St. Mellons for doing that little bit extra and brightening up my day!!!! :-) :-)					2016-10-03T17:36:05+0000	1475516165	2016-10-03 19:36:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did a grocery order and returned few items. My refund did not came for 15 days and I was blindly sure this might have happened. Guess what  when I check my account I don t see the refund at all. Finally you have to phone up Tesco to remind I returned items and then I am given a general Sorry and said it is already in process and for some reason it was in progress. What a excuse to fool people. Better to not trust services and keep a careful watch. I am very disappointed by this.					2016-10-03T16:47:34+0000	1475513254	2016-10-03 18:47:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

How come you you can debit my bank account BEFORE you deliver any goods to my house as part of an online order  but when that delivery fails and no recovery action is carried out  it takes 3working days for the money to come back? And the only advice given by the CS helpline is to place another order for another day  of which that payment is no doubt taken immediately.  End result; two lots of money payed to Tesco yet still no groceries!  I guess every little helps  eh Tesco????					2016-10-03T15:48:40+0000	1475509720	2016-10-03 17:48:40	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I picked it up from the shelf (where there was no price tag) and took it to the self serve with all my other shopping.  Firstly  the bar code wouldn t scan so had to wait ages to actually be noticed by a member of staff. She then took it out of the protective case and it still wouldn t scan. The system  didn t recognise this item . She said would call someone else to assist us but after waiting around 15/20 minutes of standing at the self serve she eventually flagged someone down and asked about the CD.   She came back and told us she couldn t sell it to us as she didn t know the price. We queried this but she took the CD away and just said we couldn t have it  depsite being nurmourous copies on the shelf and it being released the previous Friday.    Surely there is a system in place  some kind of inventory/stock system like most retail establishments where the item can be searched for to find the price. Surely even a quick search on their own website would have helped them find the price. But sadly  they didn t even bother to check this. It was easier for them to not sell us the CD than it would be to go and check the price.   So after waiting for maybe 25 at this point  we were then not able to buy the CD (which was one of the main reasons for coming into Tescos today). This also seems pretty unfair for the band in question  who will now not be able to have a sale for their CD and this could affect their position in the charts.  I really do hope this issue is sorted as the customer service was poor  we barely got an apology for our wait and the staff didn t seem to care that we weren t able to leave with our product  just told a  No  you can t have this . Begs the question of why even display this item at all if you won t let anyone purchase it? I m sure the CD we were denied went straight back on the shelf and no one took the time to find out the price or take them off the shelves to stop this happening again.					2016-10-03T15:46:09+0000	1475509569	2016-10-03 17:46:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She always says hello to my daughter and when she was newborn it was always nice to chat to her. She was telling me that she had a rotten day on Friday night as a customer had been abusive to her. It was particularly rotten. I did know about this as it had been posted on one my local Facebook selling site and there was a lot of nice comments about her.  I also work in retail and as a new mum sometimes just a smile from the lady in Tesco makes your day when you might be having quite a tough one. I always try my best in my job to do this as you never know what a smile can do. As you say every little helps. Well Sara does this every day. I hope she is recognised for her excellent customer service. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Katherine  a regular customer in market weighton.					2016-10-03T15:27:44+0000	1475508464	2016-10-03 17:27:44	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is a fresh  not frozen item which  at a price of ¬£3.50 should have been far superior to your frozen chicken roast dinner priced at ¬£1.50.  It was awful!  As soon as I peeled back the cellophane I was hit by the garlic smell of the gravy which must be a new idea you ve thought up. Bear in mind that not everyone likes garlic!!!  The frozen version has a very nice sized whole chicken breast. Not so the fresh item! At ¬£2 more you are offering very small pieces of chicken breast! What is going on?  The vegetables were so soft they were awful and the roast potatoes were white  certainly not crispy brown!  Maybe you should seriously rethink this meal.  No wonder you are selling it at a 50p discount!					2016-10-03T13:24:25+0000	1475501065	2016-10-03 15:24:25	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sat for 5 minutes waiting for the delivery driver to return and move his van from across a public road!  When I beeped he came out and shook his head at me!  As you can see  there was a perfectly good drive way right behind him which he used to let me past in the end.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14457284_10205330712106242_7180202601099278929_n.jpg?oh=6a80547c7711e004e02cb163a444dbaa&oe=58DBC97A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14457284_10205330712106242_7180202601099278929_n.jpg?oh=d925400b58910707a73e15546dbcddb7&oe=591C3F77	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205330712106242&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-03T13:21:50+0000	1475500910	2016-10-03 15:21:50	0	6	1	1	8	6	4	2	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

I renewed my delivery saver subscription in September and since then a third of my deliveries have been over an hour late  one was so late that I had to cancel it and wait 3 days for a refund.   If Tesco can t deliver the service I pay for then they shouldn t take my money for it.  I feel that Tesco are delivering late to me because I have prepaid via delivery saver.  They know I have to shop with them now and wont go elsewhere because I have already paid them.  It s a shocking service and I won t be renewing next year.  There are many other supermarkets that deliver.					2016-10-03T13:19:50+0000	1475500790	2016-10-03 15:19:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recognise this is a problem across the clothing industry  but change needs to start somewhere and you have a very powerful voice! Girls and boys alike need clothing which is practical for them to be able to run and play  and feel that their ideas and dreams are respected regardless of their gender. I work with pre-school children  and fighting those stereotypes is so hard when they re constantly being reinforced by clothing and toy marketing in the media and in big stores such as yours. I d love to see such a big company take a stand and get the ball rolling on this much needed change!   #standwithdaisy #amightygirl					2016-10-03T10:11:54+0000	1475489514	2016-10-03 12:11:54	2	0	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

Have never been able to fault the staff on the tobacco desk  they are chatty polite and most of them recognise you and know your order( think that s the hint I should stop smoking)   2. I am high functioning autistic and when the queues are too much for me to cope with waiting in them the staff has always been as helpful as possible each time.  Now the bad point....  3. Am I correct in thinking there was a post a while ago about a 24 hour store should be able to sell cigarettes all 24 hours? In only ask due to the fact that as Tesco s is one of the 3 stores in Shrewsbury that sell Vouge perle capsule. 1 being a tobacconist in the town centre and the other being Morrisons( I refuse to shop there as despite their claims I know how they pay their farmers)   But when I went in at roughly 00:30 tonight I was told they don t seek cigarettes last night  I only thought to ask after seeing a post about it and now I am thoroughly confused as unto whether or not they are sold at night?   Again apologies for the long post!  Regards James					2016-10-03T04:51:33+0000	1475470293	2016-10-03 06:51:33	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Booked a grocery delivery for my daughter between. 4 and 5 today for which I was charged ¬£4. It took me to phone at 6.15 to enquire as to its whereabouts only to be told it had been cancelled as the driver had run out of time. Reckon Tesco needs to re-think it s mission  statement as I most definitely was not served a little better today  Tesco did not try harder for me  I was not treated how I wanted to be treated and there was very little help that made zero difference to my daughter s situation. #musttrymuchharder					2016-10-02T19:40:56+0000	1475437256	2016-10-02 21:40:56	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You see I myself am not particularly partial to ready salted crisps. My kids? Well they hate them. The other half will eat them  just! üò¨So out of the 30 crisps that I bought on Thursday what is currently left....you guessed it  12 ready salted! Now this is where the disappointment kind of turned to outrage! 12 packs out of 30 were ready salted! üòµyet if I had bought the 16 multipack the 4 flavours are split equally. Why are you cramming bags with crisps nobody wants to eat Tesco?! Now I have to spend weeks trying to palm the kids off with them and listen to their incessant moaning! üôà					2016-10-02T19:21:49+0000	1475436109	2016-10-02 21:21:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As somebody who suffers from (diagnosed) OCD you can imagine how horrified I was!   To my horror I have found them crawling all over my larder cupboard and after some research the advice was to throw all food they may have been in contact with - Pasta  rice  crackers  cereal bars  couscous  cereals  dry cat food etc - in fact my cupboard is now literally bare!  I have spent the last two days spraying insecticide into all of my cupboards and washing all of my crockery and according to my research the life cycle is approx a month for all eggs to hatch so I cannot refill my cupboards until then!  I am severely stressed by the idea of bugs in my house not to mention severely out of pocket!!

I certainly don t feel that   no one tries harder customers    after being passed back and forth between customer service and the SM for the past 20 days.  I also don t think anyone one could misconstrued that the dozen phone calls/emails re the ( still in date) spoiled chicken I served up to my family ( including my 18 month old) was  treating me the way I would like to be treated   I have been a loyal customer  and outside of our rent   I gave Tesco more of our hard earned money every month than to any other expense.  Some accountability and a genuine gesture would have been the least we deserved and should have received after the days of sickness that followed consuming the spoiled chicken. I am left not feeling very valued and absolutely stunned at the way I have and continue to be treated. A little help certainly would have made a big difference.					2016-10-02T18:48:53+0000	1475434133	2016-10-02 20:48:53	1	6	1	1	8	6	3	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not due to go out of date until the 4th. Must be pretty poor quality if they go off that quickly. I have pictures of both and have also retained the packaging. I know they only cost 39p each but if you promise fresh veg it should be fresh?

I was out on my travels today and I decided to pay a quick visit to your cumbernauld extra store. Upon selecting my dinner I decided to pay a visit to your alcohol aisle  (don t judge me Mr/Mrs Tesco) and I saw a label for a gin that I have been searching across the country for since the beginning of time (Eden Mill Love Gin incase you were wondering.) To my dismay it was empty. So I asked the helpful assistant if he would kindly check for me if it was in stock. He ever so kindly did so but to my utter devastation it was gone. Now I am hoping it is not gone forever as my Sunday is now the saddest Sunday I have had in a long time.   Please please help me find my gin Mr/Mrs Tesco.   Yours with a heavy heart   Sarah					2016-10-02T18:21:11+0000	1475432471	2016-10-02 20:21:11	2	5	4	0	9	5	2	3	0	0	2	0	0	2	0	0	0

It was supposed to be  Tender fillet of beef with roasted mushroom and onion duxelle wrapped in golden puff pastry.   What we actually got was lumps of fatty  sinewy mush of meat not actually a fillet but in 3/4 different pieces  with a bland tasteless mushroom and onion duxelle and soggy pastry despite following all of your instructions as per the pack.  My partner got a lump of sinewy fat so bad he had to stop eating and throw up.   I wish I had bought and made it myself as we now have 2 full meals wasted because it s practically inedible.   What was supposed to be a nice romantic relaxed meal for 2 while my son is with his grandma has turned into a wasted night and 2 very unhappy people.  Will certainly never buy anything  Finest  again.					2016-10-02T17:35:56+0000	1475429756	2016-10-02 19:35:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought this a few weeks ago as my old one was nearly bottomless and i had some clubcard points to dispose of i also left a review before i had even tried it although it was just about its design Anyway today was my first use i now have little burns from the splashing of oil when anything is lowered into the basket the grooves in either side are a disaster when putting the basket in and when you pull the basket out because the wired sides have big gaps the chips(thin fries) fall out all over the place which caused a cascade of oil onto the and the floor which could start a fire if it hits the flame or break someone s neck from slipping on the floor im not complaining before anyone says i am nor do i want compensation  from the burns im just warning anyone who has one because it could be dangerous	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14448783_10153858202112124_9144907171579744521_n.jpg?oh=fe48982549d1b78a00c78670f2a52476&oe=591A3793	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14448783_10153858202112124_9144907171579744521_n.jpg?oh=9e43ec7e9bdba67c10e3be9ffca7e34e&oe=591FEE9E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153858202112124&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-02T16:52:27+0000	1475427147	2016-10-02 18:52:27	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Quite inconsiderate.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14495531_10154549797824402_3946524652343102725_n.jpg?oh=b48208b31b3045f9dc5e53ed9f2cf3e7&oe=58E0F0FE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14495531_10154549797824402_3946524652343102725_n.jpg?oh=3a6ba23de6a7a72692174a590bf1ef57&oe=591BC9F3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154549797824402&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-02T15:45:07+0000	1475423107	2016-10-02 17:45:07	2	4	5	0	9	4	2	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	3	0

I today went to the local Trent Vale branch of Tesco in 287 Newcastle Road  Stoke-on-Trent  ST4 6PL   armed with 6 unique Covent garden internet printable vouchers in black and white. I purchased a number of items along with 6 Covent garden soups  I had also got 6 vouchers from the company which was  new Covent garden  soups Co.  Paying through self scan I was allowed to insert 2 vouchers without any problem  scanning the 3rd voucher an alert message appear for a supervisor intervention pops up. Fine I thought  so along comes the self scan body and checks everything.  This is where the fun starts  she quizzed me over the vouchers  she asked a manager about them who duly tooted along and started to accuse me of fraud not directly i may add  she said the vouchers were photocopies and she wanted originals and the originals had a silver strip down them  I explained that these were  internet printable  vouchers and they do not have a silver strip on them for the obvious reasons  however the  duty manager for the day was adamant that they were not original despite me telling her till I was blue in the face. Even going as far as explaining how they are generated.  The duty manager informed that the companies should be  posting genuine   vouchers   through the mail i m sorry but who is she to tell companies how they should be issuing promotional money off vouchers and coupon?  I requested the 6 vouchers they had in their hand back as I stated that I had used the same type previously on another visit a few days prior  the security   self scan operator and also the Duty Manager refused to give them back.  I challenged them on this stating that they were my property and had indeed been duly printed honestly and with good intent and that I wished to have them back so I could go to Sainsbury;s to redeem them.  I was refused by all three members of staff and did not get the vouchers returned  by this time people were standing around and watching  I felt intimated  belittled and made to feel as though I was committing fraud  I duly left after emptying my bags for life of the shopping I had purchased.  On contacting the duty manager for the store in general he stated tjhat it was due to the multiple names on the vouchers  I would like to add that as long there is one unique voucher to one unique invidual  then this should not create a problem. How many customers purchase shopping for disabled partners  friends  neighbours   relatives etc etc.					2016-10-02T15:41:39+0000	1475422899	2016-10-02 17:41:39	1	15	1	0	16	15	4	11	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a phone from you less than 28 days ago. The phone has been awful: freezing  buttons jamming and yesterday the power button fell off. I took it back in and was refused a swap or return as the assistant said it was in an unacceptable condition - when asked what that condition was he said the power button being off (aka the issue I was bringing it in about) and a tiny scuff on the shell from removing the case I d had it in  - I now have to send it off to be  investigated  due to the assistant exaggerating its condition down the phone to the person he called up about it  (I can provide photos if needed of phone condition ) - I use my phone for work so not having a phone for a week plus is going to be a huge issue for me.  The assistants attitude was awful  he at one point face planted onto his computer screen in some amateur-dramatic response to me spelling my name (the only reason that I can think of for such a ridiculous response is some sort of transphobic reaction to a trans masculine person having a name he felt should be a woman s name). His whole attitude felt like it was designed to make me feel like I was being unreasonable or a trial on his patience just for existing and being in the shop asking for a replacement of a phone that was/is not up to standard with several faults it shouldn t have developed within the 26 days I ve owned it. It also felt like he was looking for excuses not to help me (searching the phone for any mark on it that he could use to refuse a refund  at one point claiming damage on the screen which turned out to be a fleck of dirt).					2016-10-02T14:52:10+0000	1475419930	2016-10-02 16:52:10	0	9	0	0	9	9	5	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Friday 30th September. My shopping was delivered with 12 items missing. I contacted your call centre and spoke to Lauren.(5pm) Lauren spent ages trying to get through to the store and told me that I would be getting a call back. Lauren was very helpful and refunded my delivery charge and also mailed me a fifteen pound e voucher by way of an apology. 2 hours later I d had no call so I called again. I was told that the person that should have called me back was named Levinson. He was on his break and would be calling me back at 8.20pm. 8.50pm stll no call so I called your call centre again. Spoke to Mark who left another message for Levinson to call me back and said it would be just after 9pm. Levinson finally returned from his mammoth break and called me at 9.25pm. No apologies instead denial that he had been given any messages to call me and said that he had been waiting for my delivery van to return to see if my missing items were there. I asked him how he knew I had missing items if he had not had any messages. He chose not to answer and asked me to tell him what my missing items were. I did. He assured me that they would be delivered the next day (1.10.16) between 11am and 12pm. (He had a bad attitude and was quite abrupt). Mark did call me back to check that Levinson had finished eating his Kit Kat and had called me. Saturday (1.10.16) 12.15pm.....Don t you just know....the missing items have not arrived. I call the call centre again. I spoke to Claire. She tried calling the store 3 times but there was no answer. (Levinson was probably on another break). To save me hanging on (again) Claire said she would call me back which she did to inform me that I wouldn t be getting my delivery today.Claire wanted to know what the missing items were so I told her and she said they would be delivered on Sunday (2.10.16) between 1pm and 2 pm.Claire told me that a manager from the store would be contacting me.(I believe the store is Greenford/Perivale) I got an email straight away from Claire showing that my delivery was scheduled for today with the missing items. I also got an email showing that the 12 items had been refunded and that I would get that refund in 3-5 days. Sunday (2.10.16) 1.15pm my order arrives. It s all there (not in carrier bags which I had previously paid for). On my receipt I noticed that not only had I been charged the delivery charge again I had also been charged because my order was under forty pounds. Are you having a laugh? The money for the missing items had been taken from my account this morning although the refund will take 3-5 days. So again I call your call centre dreading having to listen to the music that makes my ears bleed while life passes me by. I get through. I explain the whole sorry saga all over again. The man says he will refund my delivery charge and the minimum order charge. He then asks if I want anything else...yes I want to speak to a manager at the store because no one has called me back and I want to check that Levinson isn t being overworked and getting plenty of breaks..Man on phone puts me on hold. Another 10 minutes passes me by. No one is answering the phone at the store. Man on phone promises that someone will call me today or maybe tomorrow. Forgive me if I have no faith that I will get a call back.  So my questions are;Why did Levinson deny that he had any messages to call me? Why did it take him so long to call me back? Why was I promised my delivery on Saturday morning by Levinson and it never arrived? Why has no manager called me back? Why am I currently out of pocket because of Tesco s mistakes? And how long are your breaks at Tesco for your employees?  I get my shopping delivered by you every week and spend quite a bit of money. Apart from the man I spoke to today at your call centre all the other people have been helpful.(Obviously Levinson is not included in that either). Can someone please get in contact with me so that I can get some satisfactory answers? Many thanks.					2016-10-02T13:09:08+0000	1475413748	2016-10-02 15:09:08	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At about an hour late we noticed the card in the door. We were all in  curtains open  the door bell works  the porch was left open  the cars were on the drive  my mobile was on. And they left a card to say they couldn t contact us. Usually Tesco delivery service is fab  but it s caused a massive inconvenience today! And all they can offer on the phone is another delivery slot which I could have arranged myself online anyway. Disappointed.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14520331_1271738792850787_710294693927201775_n.jpg?oh=57333653e7509434bc1b09cfa7b4233b&oe=58D8CC4E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14520331_1271738792850787_710294693927201775_n.jpg?oh=293b6ba27557ef040c5a8d73c5f64eb8&oe=58E4EAB1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1271738792850787&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-02T12:54:31+0000	1475412871	2016-10-02 14:54:31	1	29	1	0	30	29	9	20	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not one but three rather exotic blue pets  all for the price of an extra large cauliflower. Unfortunately you will notice that one of them (Bill) has suffered a rather untimely demise but Bob and Fred are doing fine. This is more than can be said for the cauliflower though  I think I am far more likely to get my goldfish to jump through a flaming hoop than I am to get my kids to eat cauliflower now üòÇJust to clarify: I don t even own a goldfish.

Tonight just proved nope you don t. When a young man walks in and asks for a box of paracetamol and a lucky dip for the national lottery please. He s sold the paracetamol but refused the lottery ticket as he doesn t look 16.  Amazing so you can cause irreparable damage to your liver but you can have the chance of winning the jackpot! BTW he is 16 and also my son. The response when I confronted him why he had sold him paracetamol when he thought he was under 16? Yeah erm yeah yeah yeah so do you want the lottery ticket? üôà					2016-10-01T22:10:40+0000	1475359840	2016-10-02 00:10:40	0	5	2	0	7	5	5	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

After a few weeks  it let me sign back in.  Now  telling me to change my password for security reasons  I follow all the steps correctly and it won t let me sign in again!  It s so annoying.

Half of your fridges were down and were labeled a health and safety hazard. However  I took this from a fridge in use and as you can see it was out of date. I ve never tasted anything like it. And it s unlike fruit/veg to taste completely sour after one day over the expiry date.  Never the less  I hadn t noticed it was out of date  when I did I went straight back for a refund (which was a hassle). The worker who I d just purchased from tried to re-sell it to me  not having listened to me or noticing it was out of date herself. I eventually got a refund and I wouldn t be complaining so heavily if I hadn t been sick afterwards. It was very unpleasant.   I can only put this down to the incompetence of your staff so I thought I should let you know. This isn t the first time I ve noticed out of date products on the shelf  midday.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14517461_10211179989195344_2572894115505709213_n.jpg?oh=958673adca5edd606368a87bd451c0fd&oe=58E4A36A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14517461_10211179989195344_2572894115505709213_n.jpg?oh=570891f9ad7ba59210bb1736699cb3f1&oe=58EC4E67	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211179989195344&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-01T14:35:41+0000	1475332541	2016-10-01 16:35:41	4	3	4	0	7	3	1	2	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have never received such poor customer service in a Tesco until I moved to Stalham. Several times I have been in the store and asked a member of staff where a certain item might be  each time I was told they were out of stock and each time I have been about to leave the store when I see the item I was looking for had been placed by the door for promotional purposes  I assume. This is just laziness from the staff. However  the incident I am complaining about is unrelated other than by location.  I had just arrived and parked my car  I was walking towards the store when I heard a lady shouting in frustration. I could see a woman struggling to open the boot of her car to place a Zimmer frame in there. The person behind her had parked over their space and into hers. Now there were two trolley attendants only a few feet away from her and they ignored her completely. I could hear her from halfway across the carpark and seeing that no one was helping  I walked over and helped her to get the frame in her car. I went into the store and spoke to someone and informed them what happened. I do not feel satisfied with the response of  I will tell them  referring to the attendants.  As a customer  I expect good service whether I am in the car park  at the petrol station or on the store. It is unacceptable that your staff do not provide this service. As a staff member  customer service should be a top priority but on top of that  you are a human being and surely it should be nature to help someone who clearly needs it? I understand you can t change someone s natural instinct but it should be a heavy part of the training to be BOTHERED about the customers around you.   This store has tarred my opinion of Tesco which used to be very high. If there was another supermarket close by to my house  I would change without a second thought.

They said they are unable to open any other parcels to check where my item actually is (completely understandable) but I want my items not sure what can be done?					2016-10-01T13:48:35+0000	1475329715	2016-10-01 15:48:35	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I realised ¬£10 into fuelling that I was holding a green handle  not black. I grabbed my nearly-3 year old  ran into the kiosk  and explained what had happened. Whilst I called help  Pauline entertained my daughter  keeping her happy and chatty. When I had to run back out for my handbag  which I d left in panic in the car  she took Lilly into the office so I wouldn t have to carry her out in the pouring rain.  She offered us both a drink whilst we waited for my husband to fetch my daughter  and was really friendly and supportive. I honestly can t thank them enough for how helpful and kind they have been to us. Is it possible I could pay for some flowers or chocolates to be sent as a thank you and recognition for their help today?Thanks  Wendy x					2016-10-01T12:35:27+0000	1475325327	2016-10-01 14:35:27	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tried yesterday and was told the American Express website is down. Fair enough. Tried again today and spoke to the same member of staff. Told that the website is still down but if I come back on a week day she can phone through and get authorisation manually. Why didn t she try that yesterday when I was there on a week day!

Unfortunately today for the first time ever  I made an error with the delivery time  I thought it was 1-2pm but it was 12-1!. I got home 12.08  with a voicemail saying  in an annoyed voice  that no one was in! Completely my fault  so I rang the driver and apologised saying how sorry I was. He was a bit stroppy   I m on my back to Inverurie! . So I nicely asked if I would be able to collect it  and he said he would leave it at click and collect. Fine I thought  my fault  but the more I think about it  the more I think his attitude could have been a bit better. It was an honest mistake. I have previously gotten in my car to drive to a layby to collect my delivery because the van broke down  I did this happily  it was not a problem. I got no refund of delivery but I wasn t bothered as the delivery drivers are always so nice. On this occasion it was my fault  but someone else might have missed their delivery for a more serious reason  so might have appreciated a nicer tone!üòü Anyway  off to Inverurie to collect my shoppingüòä.					2016-10-01T12:09:37+0000	1475323777	2016-10-01 14:09:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered ¬£60 worth of groceries to be delivered between 9pm and 10pm on Wednesday evening  as I was having people round for dinner the next day.  At 10.30pm there was no sign of my delivery  nor had anyone contacted me to say that the delivery driver was running late.  I contacted the customer services number and spoke to someone who told me that the delivery driver had returned to the store with my order as he was running late and could not deliver my order after 10pm because my order contained alcohol (one bottle of wine).  I think it was completely unfair that because the delivery driver was running late  I did not receive my order at all.  I was not contacted at all by someone to explain this  until AFTER I had phoned customer services  nor was I given the option of having my order delivered without the alcohol  and by the time I had spoke to someone in customer services about my order they said it was then too late for them to re-deliver the order that night.  This then put me in a predicament as I was having people round for dinner the following night and had to make alternative plans.  The gentleman at customer services arranged to have my order delivered the following day between 5-6pm  the order came WITHOUT bags (which I had previously asked for) which then meant that I had to dump ¬£60 worth of shopping in my hall way and to top it all off I have now checked my bank and it seems I have been charged twice by Tesco for my entire order.  The gentleman that I spoke to previously in Customer Services sent me through a voucher by email to the value of ¬£10 but I m afraid after all this hassle that does not even come close to making up for all the inconvenience it has caused.  I would be grateful if you could resolve this situation as soon as possible as I really am completely dissatisfied with the service I have received and would consider using other supermarkets in the future if this is not resolved quickly.  Thanks.					2016-10-01T10:47:49+0000	1475318869	2016-10-01 12:47:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Im so very dissapointed in the service I ve been provided on Wednesday 28th September I placed an order to be deliverd on Wednesday between 9-10pm at 10.45pm my order had still not come I called your customer services to be told the stafford store manager had 4 customers in the same situation as me because our orders hasn t made it to the van! Funny that when the money was taken out my account! I had not been called texted or emailed about the situation wjen you had all day to tell me!  I was then told id have to wait till Thursday 29th September between 4-5pm to get my order this arrived luckly but when I woke on Friday 30th September you had infact taken 2 payments so not only have I had to wait an extra day for our good you have now taken two payments and left my family with nothing. When I called im Friday I was told i would be refunded that day! Think I was just fobed off! I m fuming at the lack of communication from you and for the fact that it s ok for you to just take money from my account with out asking this needs to be dealt with asap! Before I take it further ive been sent a ¬£10 voucher for what has happend really think that s a resonable compensation!...... regards a very angry customer!!!!!					2016-10-01T10:29:19+0000	1475317759	2016-10-01 12:29:19	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We called Tesco at 10.30 and they couldn t get hold of anyone to find out where our shopping was. He said someone will call us in the morning. I gave it until 9.30 before making the call myself. I was shocked to find out the driver had run out of time and our shopping was returned to the store and put back on the shelves and our money refunded! I was speechless that no one had contacted us to let us know. We were relying on items for today  it will be re sent tonight but means we now have to buy food to see us through today. I understand this situation can happen but I think it could be handled better. Luckily we have enough money for you to take the money from our account before the last lot is refunded.					2016-10-01T09:56:44+0000	1475315804	2016-10-01 11:56:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After spending 15 mins in the store we tracked down someone to talk to about buying a ps4 we were passed on to a manager who told my other half that they have the stock but it  wasn t for that offer . Confused we walked back to where the PlayStation stock was and picked up a ps4 ticket which had the offer on it   saying  take this ticket to electrical / click and collect to buy    A staff member named Sam was helpful and went out the back to get us a 500gb one telling us what a great offer it was and saying he has brought one himself a few hours before. He brought out an old ps4 500 gb   I then asked if they had any of the 1TB in stock as it was such a great offer we thought we would pay the extra and upgrade.  He went back and bought us out an ps4 1Tb and walked us down stairs to the till to pay as the tills were all shut upstairs.  As we were waiting to pay the night shift manager Damo walked up to us and took the ps4 out of Sams hands. His first words to us were  you were told this is an online only deal . He then repeated to Sam that the offer was online only and that we could only order online and collect in store. We then tried to do this but it said it was out of stock   even though the stock was physically there in front of us!!!  We then asked if we could have the 500Gb to which we were told they didn t have any....even though 5 mins ago Sam had brought one out to us!!  I then went onto the Tesco website to show that it does say in selected stores not just online only to be told again by Damo that it is an.online deal only by hot UK deals. Even though staff had told us they had brought one in store   and the tickets were out for the offer. We left empty handed and confused by Tescos Yate clear mistake. I don t understand why we were talked to like we were worthless and told time and time again that we were wrong  and then lied to about stock that we could see!!!!  Please let me know what you think about this service and if you think its acceptable.  Julya.					2016-10-01T09:13:33+0000	1475313213	2016-10-01 11:13:33	2	20	2	0	22	20	4	16	9	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday evening I bought  from your main store in Andover  a bottle of red wine - see image attached. As you will note  it has a great big promotional label around the neck of the bottle which caught my beady eye. Now  I m not a red wine buff so I buy bottles on either what I may have drunk before or the label and with that I mind I was very attracted to said bottle....I wanted to enter and win a Kitchen Aid Artisan Food Mixer as per competition on the promotional label. In a very excited mood with all the heightened expectation of winning  simillar to when I think I might win the lottery jackpot  I followed the instructions on the promotional label wrapped around the neck of the bottle of   Piccini and to my horror and subsequent disappointment THE COMPETITION HAS ENDED (and I suggest you look for yourself).   Please explain why  a) Tesco uses out of date promotional labels to sell items when the promotion has ended b) How do you expect me to win the competition prize in an out of date competition that you ve used to sell me a bottle of wine.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14495496_1313399532017531_6707833774278675608_n.jpg?oh=4a4561a462e98b96ca302956e7701c14&oe=58DE660C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q86/s720x720/14495496_1313399532017531_6707833774278675608_n.jpg?oh=652e8a19ee9639c11479fc7f6890802c&oe=5918A250	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1313399532017531&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-01T08:55:46+0000	1475312146	2016-10-01 10:55:46	5	8	5	0	13	8	4	4	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Delivered at 7.50pm last night.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14520584_10210708493053191_3906466341426529671_n.jpg?oh=1baf08a8fc3e13c1d706cea1b2f4d21c&oe=58DE9D92	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14520584_10210708493053191_3906466341426529671_n.jpg?oh=a998d81156cd5d21634221824e38cd50&oe=592041E6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210708493053191&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-10-01T07:49:51+0000	1475308191	2016-10-01 09:49:51	0	8	10	0	18	8	7	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	6	0

I slipped on a stray cucumber in your Ledbury store on Tuesday and I wanted to congratulate your staff on their professionalism when I fell backwards onto a bread knife which pierced my left lung.  The bread came in handy to pack the wound and the helipad on the roof came in handy for the air ambulance service. The cucumber survived and it came in my bottom but everyone was (were) thoroughly good chaps  thanks again   Richard.					2016-10-01T00:25:51+0000	1475281551	2016-10-01 02:25:51	2	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	10	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0
