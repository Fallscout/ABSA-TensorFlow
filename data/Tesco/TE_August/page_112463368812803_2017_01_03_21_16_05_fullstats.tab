The lady s shopping was brought round in bags and hung on her chair and she was offered help to make sure nothing was in her way as she left.   The gentleman was served with acceptance and respect and was chatted to and treated totally as an equal.  The staff were all so naturally welcoming and obviously do this sort of thing all the time - good for them!					2016-08-31T21:27:18+0000	1472678838	2016-08-31 23:27:18	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m a secondary school teacher  constantly battling graffiti. These pens are PERMANENT INK! And completely unsuitable for children in school. They re also totally useless for the type of artwork children might do regularly on paper for school (the colour bleeds on paper  not to mention permanently damaging the table below). If you re a parent  DO NOT BUY these. They re likely to get confiscated  be a total waste of the  bargain £8   and are likely to stain your carpet or table at home during home works. Tesco - read the small print! Clearly says  permanent   for those who should know better.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14068140_10154228971856117_5538658377164602046_n.jpg?oh=20fdefc00865c253b9517fe66312f09a&oe=58E904EB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14068140_10154228971856117_5538658377164602046_n.jpg?oh=eabb92365a786cdf40aaef6434789308&oe=58EC24E6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154228971856117&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-31T21:00:33+0000	1472677233	2016-08-31 23:00:33	10	9	10	1	20	8	1	7	4	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought 3x pairs of your school boys trousers (flat front  for easy ironing  hallelujah) in sizes 4-5years. Really happy with my purchases  I toddled off home and in classic lazy person fashion only tried 1 pair of said trousers on my son as I assumed  (wrongly)  that they were all the same!! Now  I come to iron on my sons little name labels  and without checking aforementioned trousers sizes AGAIN  I get busy. It s not until after the job is done that I realise one of those pairs of trousers are size 7-8yrs on a 4-5yrs hanger. You can imagine my disappointment that one  I ve already ironed the label on and two  I ve lost the receipt anyway (I m making myself sound a bit daft aren t I?). Let this be a lesson to myself and other parents - don t just check the hanger for the love of God  check the tag too  or it could be you ironing on a label and being left with a pair of trousers that won t fit for 4 years. 😢😡	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14100542_1147060152018834_635755535616972633_n.jpg?oh=12602892585a3ff56e1b94fdbf9b136e&oe=58DC54A3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14100542_1147060152018834_635755535616972633_n.jpg?oh=05eb3ada1832a94150ee8a04f71eab4a&oe=58D7605C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1147060152018834&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-31T20:59:29+0000	1472677169	2016-08-31 22:59:29	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So you can imagine at lunch time I was delighted to bite into it and taste the delicious custard flavour  yum!.... My girlfriend on the otherhand....not so lucky as hers from the same packet was apple flavour..Yuk! Anyway you ll be pleased to know I finally calmed her down and I stuck up for you Tesco  I offered her the rest of mine and I said it must just be a one off. Anyway we fancied a snack this evening....I know we re fatties so dived into the pack again and I joked.... wouldn t it be funny if yours was apple again?  Well Tesco you got some explaining to do and owe us two custard donuts because I had to give my girlfriend the rest of mine...AGAIN!! Two Apple donuts in a pack of 5 custards is just not on. There was no sticking up for you this time I m affrad. And the worst part....we had to eat the last one just to make sure it wasn t apple! Please Tesco I need some custard donuts in my life!!					2016-08-31T19:53:31+0000	1472673211	2016-08-31 21:53:31	12	2	15	0	17	2	1	1	10	0	12	0	0	2	1	0	0

Pulling out dangerously and tailgating a bus  swerving all over the road. Absolutely shocking! I have the registration number of the van though.  Is there a number to call or an email address to report this please? I ve checked the Tesco website and it s impossible to find a number to ring!

My daughter (4 years old) has a broken leg from a combination of; her brother  a firemans lift and a trampoline (it was never going to end well). This has made her summer holidays suck somewhat. Jill noticed her whilst in store today and came over to talk to her about it all. My little one explained we had glitter in our trolley so we could make her cast both girly and sparkly. Jill did no more than remove the item from our scanned items list and told us it was on her. I realise a couple of quid to Tesco is nothing but it was the humanity that counted. My girl was over the moon  particularly when Jill said she was her  hero of the day .  Sometimes Tesco you can be a big faceless organisation with profit and loss reported daily as if it s life or death  don t forget the wonderful people who make your cogs turn. Thank you  Jill .

The store was open (24 hours) but that department was closed so I was told to call back anytime before 8pm. Couldn t customer service just deal with it? Very annoying!  I thought I d try the other store about a mile away buckshaw tesco  this store hasn t got a technology department but were more than happy to give me a replacement. How s that work? A bit of consistency please tesco!  My first tv lasted 3 weeks my replacement 2 weeks. Same fault same TV. I returned it to buckshaw today and was told to ring blaupunkt. The lady behind customer services (not the technology dept they don t have one)  shell  rang them for me. Blaupunkt told me it was a known fault and to address it they would send me a link via email containing a software update that I would have to load onto a USB and put into my tv. I don t own a USB stick or a laptop to do this and why should I anyway? I told shell I just wanted a refund as it was the 2nd Tv and that I had bought a replacement already from argos as the TV was for my elderly father and I didn t want to leave him without a to. Shell then had to ring tesco tech department explained the situation and passed me over. They decided they couldn t do anything as blaupunkt had givin me a resolution. I explained I didn t have a USB or a laptop or the time to be messing. They suggested I buy a USB and go to a public library to download the software and update my tv. Really? You are selling faulty TVs (comfirmed by blaupunkt) and expecting you d customers to fix them themselves? Surely they should be recalled by tesco  updated by blaupunkt and then put back on your shelves? The tech department said the decision was final and that was that. Luckily shell agreed with me that the situation was ridiculous and that I shouldn t have to go to a public library to download software that should already be on the tv and called  duty  Alex. He was a very helpful young man and my tv was refunded. Alex and shell are a credit to the store.  So my complaint.   All stores should be able to return any goods even if the department is closed.   I made 5 trips to two stores to buy 1 tv.  I was in the store for well over 30 mins which to me should have been an in and out refund.  The tech support team are useless and very unhelpful.  You are selling faulty TVs!  A terrible shopping experience.  A big thankyou to shell for her patience and Alex for his understanding and humanity!					2016-08-31T18:27:47+0000	1472668067	2016-08-31 20:27:47	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to see a change to the recipe of your frozen potato croquettes  i have not had any trouble with any other brand of croquettes besides tescos brand. The issue is they simply do not cook very well with many cooking methods. in the oven i follow the instructions and cook to specifications  they still look as though they came out the packet. so i performed a test and cooked another brand of croquettes and they cooked in far less time and actually looked as if they where cooked. Whereas your brand where just very hard and didn t look appealing  nor taste as if fully cooked. i then tried frying  again the other brands where no problem they cooked perfectly fine. but yours where still ice cold on the inside although browned on the outside  on further attempts i cooked them at a much lower temperature to heat them through and fryed them slowly at the higher temperature . although cooked well throughout and outside the coating was way too hard on them. so in a sort of conclusion to these light tests i have determined that maybe the recipe of the coating of the croquettes should be chnaged  the potatoe on the inside is fine as it is simply mashed potatoe and that cooks fine. if anyone else hads ahd issues with tesco brand croquettes give this a like and we shall see if tesco listen and offer up a new improved recipe.					2016-08-31T17:14:48+0000	1472663688	2016-08-31 19:14:48	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After Eights you say?? But it s not even 5pm!!! Yes I know  and I happen to agree with this sentiment. Wreckless behaviour like that has no place in an office. Especially not one of the charitable kind. What would the community team say???......Oooohhh think of the shame.  Regaining my sanity  I remembered the packet of Flat Peaches I bought from the Tesco Store in Twickenham on Monday that were sitting on my desk. Not exactly a box of Nirvana  but sweet  and flat. Just enough to keep Augustus Gloop from sinking beneath the shallows.  Pawing at the packet like an eager frat boy  I m embaressed to say a rush of excitement overcame me when I finally released those natural sugar highs. Fruity fun and none of the gum. Winning starts right here folks. My excitement was shortlived however when I realised that all was not ok with my fuzzy peach. My fuzzy peach was brown and mouldy!!! How could this be?! I washed my fuzzy peach. I kept it at a cool temperature. I did everything I could to keep my fuzzy peach in tip top condition. So why has it foresaken me?  Please help me understand Tesco. I need support to deliver me from my despair. I am now on my way to buy a packet of After Eights. There will be uproar from the Community Team.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14212834_10210652545491187_1674671979032164360_n.jpg?oh=a42ebdd2ceaf165f0c134d5a1b7a620e&oe=58ED684D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14212834_10210652545491187_1674671979032164360_n.jpg?oh=2315b80099363d59dad61d4bf53f4253&oe=591AF240	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210652545491187&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-31T15:58:58+0000	1472659138	2016-08-31 17:58:58	9	12	9	0	21	12	6	6	2	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

He has gone out of his way today to help...... Its all about knowledge and finding out what the shopper wants  being seen on the shop floor working with the other staff and introducing himself to the shopper. Well done Mark this guy has put my faith back in Tesco Greenfield keep up this manner and I am sure you may get back some of the shoppers that now go elsewhere to do their shopping					2016-08-31T15:44:12+0000	1472658252	2016-08-31 17:44:12	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I asked this lady if she was ok she cried help! Your security guard told me to go away! The two members of staff told me she was fine! She was NOT fine! I don t know or care if she had done wrong in the shop or a normal customer but you DON T treat anyone like that! It s wrong and as a result you won t see me there again!

I rang for help straight away and explained that my son had already gone 10 days without it and was now in full on meltdown due to it being returned broken. The kind man on the phone got his managers permission to give me a full refund instead of waiting for another repair!! Thank you tesco for understanding the importance of a working tablet to an autistic child!! My son picked a new tablet this morning  he picked 1 that was in the sale and had enough (with a couple of extra pound from mum!) to buy his brother one too!!					2016-08-31T13:07:09+0000	1472648829	2016-08-31 15:07:09	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have your midweek delivery saver plan but wanted to change to the anytime plan as we have a few things coming up that this would be useful for. Why can we not upgrade immediately rather than wait till the current plan runs out in November? I could understand if we wanted to go to a lesser plan  but we re wanting to give you more money!					2016-08-31T11:45:14+0000	1472643914	2016-08-31 13:45:14	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been a customer of Tesco for many years  so imagine my surprise when I went to buy tomatoes I could only find 1 variety grown in the UK out of 12 different packs. These were  on the vine salad toms  all the others on display were from Italy  France and Spain. WHY in the middle of the Summer do you not supply British. I then went round looking at other fruit and veg and found that approx 60% were of other than UK origin. I always thought Tesco supported UK farmers  and when I queried this with management was informed that  Tesco always did what was best for the customers pricewise  NOT an answer!!!

He was so chuffed to get a complimentary lunch box filled with lush treats for him to take to his first day of school next week.  He is beyond excited!!  I  on the other hand  am not so excited. This precious child who has been by my side for 4 1/2 years is soon to be gone....soon to be swallowed by the education system from which he fully won t emerge until he is 18 years old.  By then  he won t be an adorable  hugging sweetheart like he is now but he ll likely be a hairy  grunting teenager who just wants to steal from my purse  use my car at every opportunity and throw his pants all over the place.  This realisation is very upsetting. My tear ducts are taking a beating.  So could I suggest sending a complimentary calming crate of gin and a box of Kleenex with my next order?   And perhaps a suitcase filled with Hobnobs to devour infront of  Homes Under The Hammer  which I ll now be watching every day before work (without interruption) whilst my son isn t by my side.  Yours sincerely   A broken-hearted mother.  #everylittlehelps	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14203302_10157370763985635_5467333748892832638_n.jpg?oh=e5a0438847b2c083b9c17c59429662e6&oe=58E51C31	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14203302_10157370763985635_5467333748892832638_n.jpg?oh=0327b8f483caff33b23cf82d00cc056a&oe=58DF8E3C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157370763985635&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-31T09:05:51+0000	1472634351	2016-08-31 11:05:51	18	2	19	1	22	2	2	0	11	0	17	0	0	1	0	0	0

As you can expect this ruined the rest of my enjoyable evening meal and I m hoping that no others sneaked into my mouth undiscovered!  We thought it would be best to check the rest of our veg that we bought at the same time and shockingly another caterpillar was in the other broccoli and bugs infested the bottom if the savoy caggage.  Absolutely disgusting and we certainly won t be buying any veg from you again!!

Without warning you have stopped selling his favourite cereal and replaced it with a chocolate version. What good is that for a child that doesn t like chocolate. He loved your milk pillow cereal with the milk Centre and Iv been shopping to find you no longer sell this. How do I console s devastated 5 year old because you ve stopped (for no reason that I can see) doing his favourite cereal.

The ones i received last night were barely fit for one use let alone repeat usage.  I noticed the quality increase when the charge came in  however now they seem to be back to the ultra thin poor quality rubbish you used before.  Is this an attempt at cost cutting?

Shopping finally arrived at 2340  after a voicemail left at 2130 told me that it was going to be really soon... Thanks for the effort  and sorry to my neighbours for the disruption.  The delivery person was so careful to be quiet and must ve really kicked themselves when the reverse alarm went off. It s happened to all of us....  So today was a case of lots if information just that it was wrong <yawn>...  But I really feel for the poor guy. I hope I was the last drop this evening. He sounded so sad. I hope the neighbours heard how sorry he sounded too.  My boy was sad to have missed helping unpack the shopping but he slept through it  as small kids can.  Thanks Tesco  and please give this driver a better van.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14079996_10154440500207296_4341786317952624592_n.jpg?oh=4dd823e8c7ce97bafadb68837e4dcf9f&oe=591E76D8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14079996_10154440500207296_4341786317952624592_n.jpg?oh=ef275eabd89232a4a4ca932bebf2b624&oe=5921DED5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154440500207296&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-30T22:53:34+0000	1472597614	2016-08-31 00:53:34	3	1	3	1	5	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

It might of only been a banana but it stopped her from crying the member of staff didn t need to do anything but she did I m sorry I didn t get your name but you know who you are thank you ever so much 👍					2016-08-30T22:32:53+0000	1472596373	2016-08-31 00:32:53	13	3	13	0	16	3	2	1	3	0	13	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received a call at around 4 informing me we either needed to pick up our shopping (we had a 6-8 slot) before 6:30 or go via customer services and ask for a specific person  as there was no one available to work in the collection pod after 6:30.  My husband finished his shift at 7  so went to collect it  I d informed him of the phone call  so off he went to customer services.  He was then told to go to the pod......pointless phone call earlier then.   On arrival  he was given 3 bags of shopping that weren t ours  so he told the person there and they replied with  so where s yours then?!   They then had to root through several crates to find ours  which had been stickered up wrong.  My husband then came home  half an hour later than he should ve been  and left me to unpack it all....  ALL my fruit is missing.  The frozen stuff that had been labelled wrong was almost defrosted  the meat was in with some donuts (yum!)  and said donuts were so hot they d sweated off their icing.  My meat was warm  and I know its a warm day  but as warm as the bread was isn t acceptable-not sure if its even edible now.  I ve literally got less than half my shopping that I know is useable  because most of that is non perishable items  or toiletries.  Tomorrow my husband is off work  we had hoped to take our children for a day out  before they go back to school-but now I have to factor in a food shop we had intended to avoid by doing it online!!!!!!!  I sent the above to tesco on here. And at first they did the whole  we are truly sorry nonsense . After taking my details they told me they could reorder my missing items but it would obviously cost me  then that they d get someone to call me tomorrow to sort re-delivery if needed  even when I d said because it s literally everything fresh that s missing I need to get it asap in the morning - it s my kids fruit veg and lunch stuff for christ sake!  I got asked to send the list of missing and things with an issue which is LONG and once I d wasted my time sending that  I was then told to take my receipt into store to sort a refund for all things missing. As if that s going to work when the store have no idea I ve been told to do this.   So now I m without most of my shopping because of a basic staffing issue that could ve been avoided.   I ve spent all night trying to sort it and ended up out of pocket  no decent food in the house and now time taken out of the last day my kids have off with their daddy because we need to go shopping.   Thanks tesco! Never mind I shop once a week with you online and spend £350 a month. Customer loyalty isn t in this shops vocabulary.					2016-08-30T22:09:29+0000	1472594969	2016-08-31 00:09:29	0	1	1	1	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

We are both very much still baffled so please could you send a sensible reply for my eagle eyed daughter so she can sleep at night!! 😀 thank you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14102450_10154484706246255_2071986994694965147_n.jpg?oh=80e3c6c9f6cb89c85903d1dec7d04e9c&oe=58E4AAB4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14102450_10154484706246255_2071986994694965147_n.jpg?oh=39cdb5e922973e8b1af705c0cb2216ca&oe=591D22B9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154484706246255&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-30T21:23:18+0000	1472592198	2016-08-30 23:23:18	21	8	28	0	36	7	3	4	3	0	21	0	0	7	0	0	0

I always use scan and pack when I shop in tesco as I find it a lot quicker than checking out at a till point.  On Saturday we purchased a few items at the Tesco on the Yarmouth/Gorleston retail park. My husband went to a normal checkout to pay. After his receipt came out he then got 4 vouchers including £9 of a £60 shop. I was really surprised with this as I have not received any vouchers like these for months. I thought it was funny so when I went in today to do a £85 shop using scan and pack I mentioned this to the assistant who confirmed what I thought and that when using this service you do not get any money off/points bonus vouchers.   This is disgusting and not fair  why should we be penalised for using a service that saves Tesco time and money but takes us longer to shop. In my eyes we are all customers and spending money so why not treat all the same. A very unhappy customer.					2016-08-30T21:22:33+0000	1472592153	2016-08-30 23:22:33	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst I appreciate that the nappies seem to cost less now  this has coincided with this decline in quality. It now looks like I m left with a choice of this cheap option Vs the more expensive leading brand (when I think Tescos nappies were actually better!). My preference would be for a mid range option which now seems to be have been denied if I continue my online shop with tesco.com.					2016-08-30T21:01:23+0000	1472590883	2016-08-30 23:01:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m dreading opening the others now  or at least I will do so under extreme caution. We only got back from your store about an hour ago  which had hardly anything fresh on the shelves that we wanted.

There was no notice to say these were out of date they just said reduced on special offer. Really dissapointed as I m 30 weeks pregnant and don t want to be eating out of date food and risking my babies health. Granted it s only crisps but what if this had been meat or dairy products. Really would appreciate you looking into why your store is selling off products without notifying customers. 😡	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14102400_10154523100583628_2968734535357542348_n.jpg?oh=9570a744382cf30ed28f19100c654700&oe=58D6F0CC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14102400_10154523100583628_2968734535357542348_n.jpg?oh=2766e5d2bf7c65e3e128832f133e9958&oe=591DA7C1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154523100583628&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-30T20:02:10+0000	1472587330	2016-08-30 22:02:10	0	23	2	1	26	22	4	18	12	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

I am referring to your own-brand washing up gloves  or as I prefer to call them  the slipperiest thing known to mankind. With this product you have turned a laborious daily chore into something more akin to wrestling an excitable snake covered in baby oil.   Now I am a fit 28 year old  without the least tremor in my hands  and yet I have just dropped and broken a glass (one of my favourite  as sods law would have it). I dread to think what kind of hell some of your less steady customers must go through.   I genuinely believe this is actually a dangerous product; I could have easily cut myself badly  and you should change suppliers or alter the design.  Tesco  you need to get a grip!   (Sorry  I couldn t resist the obvious pun)					2016-08-30T18:50:47+0000	1472583047	2016-08-30 20:50:47	5	4	6	0	10	4	3	1	0	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	0

I went into your chineham Basingstoke store today to sort my prescription for my glasses. It took me an hour of much swapping and changing to finally decide on what I wanted. I was being advised by the lovely ladies who work in the opticians department all of this time. They made me feel so relaxed about buying my first ever set of glasses. After much chatting and laughing with them I was ready to pay up and leave but before I could they came round the corner with a lovely bunch of flowers for my birthday tomorrow.  It s the little things in life that make life so much nicer. You have really made my day!!					2016-08-30T17:11:31+0000	1472577091	2016-08-30 19:11:31	3	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

They also taste pretty rubbish too! I posted this picture on my timeline and a few friends said they had had the same problem with sweet potatoes from Tesco from stores all over the country  so I m not alone! Hopefully you can fix it as it s happened consistently now for a while.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14102432_10209104690367335_8185982163633863748_n.jpg?oh=53de21ef42dbdeec1b0d8932a9a123a0&oe=58DC05A0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14102432_10209104690367335_8185982163633863748_n.jpg?oh=55f537fa192bb832761286143cd5b76d&oe=58D9F0AD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209104690367335&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-30T17:05:47+0000	1472576747	2016-08-30 19:05:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m a single working mum of two so shopping is difficult anyway and i had a double pram  and a trolley.. tried pushing it through the store  WITH all your staff staring at me some even laughing at me! And when I got to the till  she put all my stuff at the end and left me to it.. and my 4 month old was screaming the whole time!  Instead of offering to help  I was made uncomfortable!

Amongst other things we grabbed some sausages for a bbq for that evening. The next day we were very ill ( I wont go into details ) I thought we may have picked up a bug but checked in the fridge for the remainder of the sausages and then saw that they were 2 days out of date. My family and I were very unwell for the next 4 days.  We returned to Tesco today to complain  we spoke to customer services and the manager and were greeted with the comment of  what do you want us to do about it  and were given the £2.50 back that we spent on them. Although we take responsibility for not checking the date this time  this isn t the first time there have been severely out of date things on there shelves and rude staff. We feel we have not been dealt with well at all and feel this is unacceptable.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14100419_10157661059585508_4717690149930884637_n.jpg?oh=4d2d53c8f6ac5dbc3473aaeb8719df02&oe=59212266	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14100419_10157661059585508_4717690149930884637_n.jpg?oh=79bbccdab8700721e43e9e3c16486375&oe=591F426B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157661059585508&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-30T14:27:13+0000	1472567233	2016-08-30 16:27:13	2	15	3	0	18	15	6	9	2	0	2	0	0	0	1	0	0

After leaving the store  I opened one of the bags to share with my friend and we began to eat them  confused as to why they were so dry and tasted foul with no flavour  I looked at the date on the packaging. The chicken s use by date was the 12th of August  2 weeks prior to the date that I bought the chicken.   I went back to the store to make a complaint that my friend and I had just bought and EATEN 2 weeks out of date chicken. The manager tried to tell me to just go and collect another bag off of the shelf as a  sorry  and explained it was  human error  that this bag was missed. She then explained that the only other thing that she could do was give me £5  and again kept trying to give me the  human error  excuse. I would understand maybe a couple of days  but 2 weeks is just disgusting and  human error  does not cover it. On Saturday  I felt extremely unwell  and later that evening I was very poorly as well as my friend  and I can think of no other reason for this but because of the out of date chicken I had eaten the day before.   Quite frankly  I have been completely put off ever shopping at tesco s again due to this experience  and I feel that the issue was not dealt with seriously enough by the colleague in this store  if that was a child that had eaten that chicken  they could have been even more unwell. I m just worried and concerned that this may happen again as 2 weeks out of date food can do a lot of harm.  As a worker within the food industry myself  I know the guidelines that are put in place to ensure that dates are checked to minimise the chance of this happening  I am just concerned that this may happen again.  I look forward to hearing back from you.

Our girls thoroughly enjoyed taking part and cooking the 9 dishes over three afternoons  they got to bring their creations home at the end of each session and and at the end of the three days they were presented  by the store manager  with a certificate and a £5 Tesco gift card.  Fantastic way of keeping our girls occupied for a couple of days during the long summer holidays  and best of all  it was all free!

The offer on them is amazing and they last  he doesn t leak through or anything. I noticed the design changed a few months ago which didn t cause problems for us at all! I ran out of nappies at the weekend so I went into the tower park Poole store and purchased some more. 3 packets for £10. As soon as I opened them a strong horrible fragranced smell came out. It smelt like room freshener. Since using them my little boy has developed a rash (I cannot be sure if its the nappies - may be a coincidence) every time I put a nappy onto him he cries. The smell gives me a headache so I dread to think what it does to my son.   I am just writing this to see if anything has been added to these nappies? Has a fragrance been added that hasn t actually been tested on whether it s healthy for a baby or not? My little boy is 11 months and we ve never had problems with these nappies until now.   If you could get back to me would be much appreciated 😊  I can t put him on pampers because it gives him a red bum and red weepy marks that look like burns.  I use tesco as they ve always been amazing and it s so close to home  whereas I ll have to change to Aldi or sainsburys which are harder to get to   Thank you   Jade					2016-08-30T11:05:49+0000	1472555149	2016-08-30 13:05:49	1	5	1	1	7	5	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My latest delivery showed only one substitution but the cherry scones I ordered were plain scones on arrival  and the two packets of trout fillets were one trout  one smoked mackerel. This is the third delivery in a row that this has happened. If the van driver had pointed this out  we would have sent both back as they were not what I ordered.The delivery was accepted by my husband and son as I was out and they were unaware of what had been ordered. I am now thinking of cancelling my delivery subscription as this is so annoying. I had planned to use both in a special Bank Holiday meal but had to change the menu.					2016-08-30T11:01:09+0000	1472554869	2016-08-30 13:01:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have two young children who were excitedly waiting for him to arrive and it s been hard on us all. I rang up your customer services last night and asked if I could return the puppy food we had bought. When I explained the situation and that I am pretty much housebound due to illness the lady I spoke to arranged for our delivery driver to collect the food today when bringing our groceries and refunded us the full cost. We were so grateful that she had made this tough job a lot easier for us and we didn t need to look at his unused food. Today when our shopping arrived the driver took the food and gave us these chocolates from the store with a message of heartfelt sympathy for our loss. We re blown away by the kindness and understanding you  as a company  have shown. It may seem like a small gesture to you but it has had a big effect on us all. It is things like this that really make the difference between good and exceptional customer service. Thank you so much.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14192101_1724391447824009_1696091262921503820_n.jpg?oh=ba9d16bdf130e9c039a364a2bf1e9e60&oe=58EDD59E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14192101_1724391447824009_1696091262921503820_n.jpg?oh=62c093bd747fc2647e869fea76d74e13&oe=591B5D8B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1724391447824009&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-30T10:24:23+0000	1472552663	2016-08-30 12:24:23	18	3	19	0	22	3	3	0	2	0	18	1	0	0	0	0	0

My son saved for a very long time to buy your Hudl 2 last year - a few months later the screen cracked whilst it was on charge. Tesco have repeatedly refused to look at it  claiming it must be accidental damage  even though many others have reported the exact same problem. It has even been on Watchdog. Shame on you Tesco for taking the saved up money of a young child and then refusing to help when your product goes wrong.					2016-08-30T07:51:00+0000	1472543460	2016-08-30 09:51:00	1	16	2	1	19	16	10	6	8	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

We love shopping at tesco  its always got a friendly atmosphere and friendly staff who are always willing to help   Now  for the odd request. I got married yesterday  and being local I got married just up the road from your stowmarket store. On the way to the church however i got incredibly nervous and needed the toilet  desperately  so stopped outside your store and dashed in  followed by 3 bridesmaids  mother of the bride and photographer (who all thought it was hilarious). is it possible to have a copy of CCTV of this at all? I have photos from the photographer which I will post when they come though when back from my honeymoon in 2 weeks   Just again  thanks so much for all of your kind staff and friendly shoppers who saw me and gave their congratulations and biggest smiles!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14192046_10155083009545021_1526389653011580895_n.jpg?oh=afbc365e9ab564293a15560891b3dbf0&oe=58D85124	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14192046_10155083009545021_1526389653011580895_n.jpg?oh=184e092930843734a295598a9c6ef333&oe=58DD5E29	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155083009545021&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-29T20:23:32+0000	1472502212	2016-08-29 22:23:32	34	4	38	0	42	4	3	1	7	0	34	2	0	1	0	0	0

She asked me to send with pictures:  Me again! I seem to be contacting your offices frequently. Whether it be about my order not turning up  the rudeness of a delivery driver  the low-quality of your products or the short use-by dates of the day after delivery  I m sure you d agree that by now we should be on a first name basis. The laughable part is that for every complaint I submit  there are 2 or 3 more incidents that I don t as I don t want to come across as that annoying person who is always moaning. Ironically  one of the times I didn t complain was when I found a live spider in my broccoli (it was vacuum packed and he d made a lovely home for himself within the stems). The broccoli that was delivered as part of my most recent order (Thursday 25th August) seemed fine. It came with two stalks and the second one I d only just got around to using. After steaming and serving up  I noticed a caterpillar and maggot in the stems (do you plant the spiders in the broccoli as natural pest control?!). I took pictures before throwing everything away  including the rest of my dinner as I couldn t bring myself to eat. I d be happy to send the pictures should you wish. 	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14141637_1166670333355186_5388710043996148373_n.jpg?oh=2fbc6b99101f1470c3392210d66485ab&oe=58DD7B9D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14141637_1166670333355186_5388710043996148373_n.jpg?oh=302e64d6f2448e0d1eee7254a01d5c9f&oe=58E70A88	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1166670333355186&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-29T19:22:17+0000	1472498537	2016-08-29 21:22:17	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t know whether or not you ve changed suppliers but the ones arriving in the Magdalen St Oxford store (dated 1 September) had to be thrown out rather than consumed.  I can t provide evidence of this because  as anyone who has eaten boil in a bag kippers knows  the details on the packet disappear once you ve boiled them for 15 minutes as per instructions.  Can you sort this out for me because otherwise I m going to swear off kippers... However I still enjoy your sourdough Best wishes.

Even though with food residue I won t be able to recycle  but at least it is biodegradable.					2016-08-29T18:26:35+0000	1472495195	2016-08-29 20:26:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Saturday I ordered a click and collect order. When I got home I noticed I was missing items from my shopping I phoned tescos today to inform them. I was told some one will call me back within 2 hours to sort my items out. Needless to say it s not 19.21 6 hours later and no return phone call. I then go to make tea using tesco  finest  new potatoes. Well finest is quite far from what I got not just one bag but two bags of scabby mouldy potatoes. Not impressed only used click and collect as I was pushed for time. I m quite disgusted in the quality of the product launch I did receive and disgusted in the customer services I didn t receive.					2016-08-29T18:24:32+0000	1472495072	2016-08-29 20:24:32	0	7	1	0	8	7	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

There was plenty other bags that could ve been scanned through but apparently this wasn t allowed as there was no one from Claire s there. Surely there should be someone from each department especially independent ones at all times to help their customers. But obviously not!! I was told they would ring me as soon as someone from Claire s was in but this is an inconvenience for me as I would have to travel all the way back to pick it up. Not happy with this service and the woman who  helped  wasn t really any help at all. Now my little girl will have to go without the lovely bag and is just as upset as me!!					2016-08-29T17:57:02+0000	1472493422	2016-08-29 19:57:02	1	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He s autistic and has a few physical issues that make walking round the store difficult so we usually use the trolley with the big seat. Unfortunately it was broken and impossible to push today and the response of the staff member my husband spoke to was that if there isn t another one out there there s nothing they can do.   Would you consider providing more than one trolley with a big seat in every store? Shopping becomes more difficult for everyone and distressing for my son without it and I know several families who would be utterly stuck without it.					2016-08-29T17:40:38+0000	1472492438	2016-08-29 19:40:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought some of you finest roasted hazelnut  oat and Belgian chocolate cookies. They come in a pack of four which is perfect for my family. Have one each to my boys and kept two for myself (as you do lol) and all of a sudden I hear my son spitting his cookie out.

I entered my phone number and was sent a message advising me i would be charged €7.50 per week to be entered into a draw. I immediately sent STOP to the number indicated however over the next 24 hrs i was sent a total of 55 messages at which time i had to block voucher club and the 57976 number. I myself had sent numerous STOPs to them to no avail. Got to say this is disgraceful. Aldi and Lidl would relish this. Who knows what my phone bill will be like at the end of the month.

Turns out all my chilled items are missing   he apologies again and tells me to ring up and let them know. So I ring up and speak to a lovely lady who said she d sort it out. Shortly after someone else rings back to say a driver is out with all my chilled food and will be 15 minutes. This was almost 1 hour ago bow and I m still waiting.  I understand mistakes happen  I m more bothered that I was told 15 minutes and there is still no sign of my food. If it would take longer  tell me it d be longer. 😡					2016-08-29T09:17:53+0000	1472462273	2016-08-29 11:17:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have had our first buggy/wheelchair free shopping trip and it was a total success! My little boy has quadriplegic cerebral palsy and cannot sit unaided and this chair has allowed him to ride in the shopping trolley for the first time! Not only does he LOVE the ride  but it means that I will be able to go shopping on my own with the children  where before I have had to have someone with me or do it all online. This trolley will undoubtedly change the lives of special needs parents!

She has recently started having her groceries delivered by Tesco because she is  housebound. The snag is she does not have the internet  so what she is doing is phoning her daughter who lives near Birkinhead with her order. Her daughter is passing her order on to Tesco and my cousins local Tesco in the West Country is delivering. My cousin then sends her daughter a cheque. Is there an easier way for someone who does not have the internet to order from Tesco?  P.S. She is delighted with what she is getting delivered.					2016-08-29T07:24:28+0000	1472455468	2016-08-29 09:24:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was pleseantly surprised that I can choose not to have plastic bags any more and on my most recent order I was happy to see that my apples came in a lovely paper bag. And then I looked inside… Said apples in a thin  one use only plastic bag.  What was the point of that? I already have heart palpitations when I shop in supermarket inthe country and practially EVERYTHING is unneccsessarily wrapped in plastic. Come on Tesco  use paper bags not as well as plastic but instead of. Follow the slogan on the paper bag.  And one more small point - don t use plastic bags to freeze extra herbs as advertised on the bags - use glass jars!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14102718_10154446409736672_3387359298762671766_n.jpg?oh=4339b96c1f0920ce810bffb25b4ee153&oe=58E17773	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14102718_10154446409736672_3387359298762671766_n.jpg?oh=bdeac9418fb3b1eeead4172fdf56c798&oe=591C2E95	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154446409736672&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-29T06:48:32+0000	1472453312	2016-08-29 08:48:32	4	5	4	0	9	5	2	3	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

On the front it says one-quarter of a pack contains 63kcal (on the back this states 1/4 being 50g) The product contains 4xsteaks and the overall weight is 400g. Surely each steak would then weigh roughly 100g each. The packaging suggests 100g being 125kcal. 400g of cauliflower would be roughly 100kcal  which suggests that tiny sachet containing: rapeseed oil  lemon concentrate  garlic purée  thyme  lime zest  parsley  lemon zest  garlic  sea salt  black pepper is 350kcal!!!!!???	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14141638_324601664550095_3764603253806041928_n.jpg?oh=e805fe2b542b9d5d2e582f112665ad43&oe=591C2EF2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14141638_324601664550095_3764603253806041928_n.jpg?oh=e81353eb30942891fd79b9835a156f70&oe=58E09D0D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=324601664550095&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-28T18:51:37+0000	1472410297	2016-08-28 20:51:37	1	3	1	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was for my mum for my little brothers and sisters. Unfortunately once building it we realised the top pole was snapped (explained why we struggled following the instructions) neither of us drive and it s a pretty impossible walk from where we are to the nearest Tesco with this heavy thing (luckily got a lift when buying it) and after hours of building this thing we now have to spend hours dismantling it and need to somehow find a way back to the store. For the price i paid and for the simple fact it s for children to play with I m disappointed in the fact it was broken!

Possibly  we though  cheaper than the local chip shops!  £20 odd later for an all day breakfast  chilli & rice  2 kids meals & a couple of drinks.  Food arrived at the table:  my all day breakfast came cremated  BURNED EGGS  OVER COOKED HASH BROWNS  UNDER COOKED BACON (it still oinked) & UNDER COOKED FRIED BREAD (swapped for my beans) & cold  over cooked chips.  The £4.99 chilli & rice was little more than a few dollops of rice and as much as 2 TABLESPOONS of chilli.  The kids meals were okay  except the chips were over cooked & cold.  I complained about the lack of chilli and the guy  who looks like the guy that works in the crusty burger places in the simpsons (should make him fairly easy to identify) apologised for the lack of chilli & explained  i just used what we had left in the tub/tin  i will do some more now   I then went on to explain that i was unhappy with my food  he offered to at the least replace my eggs as he said  they look wrong   I was left with INEDIBLE BACON  HASH BROWNS i couldnt bite  ive had softer chunks of ice! Horrible chips & now a sour taste in my mouth  more so from being told they wouldnt touch my meal because  thats just how we serve it   Im fuming  £20 and i didnt even get a meal i could eat!

Whilst shopping my daughter needed the toilet so rather than dump our shopping my wife asked Jack if there were any toilets.   He was on the till and the only member of staff in the actual shop  he took my wife and daughter to the toilets where there was 2 other members of staff talking and then hurried back to the till.  When my wife and daughter had finished they came back out to find poor jack being shouted at!  1) by allowing them to use the toilet it meant we continued with our purchases and didn t leave the store.  2) if they were shouting at him for leaving my wife alone why didn t one of them go on the till whilst he waited  or at least offer to wait in the back for my wife.  3) there is no way he should have been in trouble  but even if he was he shouldn t have been told off on the shop floor in front of customers!  Once we had finished our shopping we joined the queue to pay  again poor jack was on his own on the till and quite a queue was building  he rang the bell for assistance on 3 separate occasions before anyone came to help him and open another till.  I genuinely think that Jack should receive recognition for the service he provided today  I however feel that his manager and co worker need to be given a serious chat around customer service and teamwork!					2016-08-28T17:52:09+0000	1472406729	2016-08-28 19:52:09	230	34	236	26	296	33	25	8	87	0	224	6	0	0	0	0	0

While shopping in this store  I was walking behind a tesco security man as he paused briefly and turned into the aisle I was going.  He approached a very young boy  who was down on his knees looking through a box of mini puzzles that cost 1 euro.  Clearly due to the selection of mini puzzles in this box  this young child was taking them out to have a look  and placing them beside the box on the shelf  when the security man asked him what was he doing  the child say he was looking  the security man in my strongest opinion  proceeded to verbally scold the child by telling him not to take them out. I was surprised by this reaction to the child by this security man  so I approached him to say  the child is allowed to look  and he cannot tell the child not to look  the security man took offence in my opinion  to me speaking to him  he told me to go about my business  to which I repeated this is not his job to tell customers they cannot look  again he told me to go about my business  and not to tell him his job  and to get out  which came as a shock  I told him I would not leave  and again that he is security and cannot tell a custom not to look  we are all intitled to look. I m sure this can be seen on your shop recording. I don t think Tesco should allow or permit their security to approach any child that was clearly doing nothing wrong. Itade my stomach turn tp see an adult clearly over step their mark  especially when it concerns a minor. I would like you thoughts and views on this. I hope you take my concerns on board and look into the matter. Kind regards.					2016-08-28T17:29:05+0000	1472405345	2016-08-28 19:29:05	16	15	18	1	34	14	12	2	14	0	16	0	0	0	0	2	0

I found this beautiful bouquet of flowers in your Cleethorpes store and thought they were perfect!  I took them home to surprise mum with them and she was over the moon!  Unfortunately  this mood only lasted over night as after returning from a shopping trip today  we came home to find them a little worse for wear 😔  As you can imagine  my mum is very disappointed the flowers haven t lasted longer than 24 hours. To restore her faith in Tesco  is there anything you can do to turn her frown upside down? ☺️ Thank you!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14088547_1075917775790269_5677353462165034660_n.jpg?oh=147c30a24525fde1d5b7c517eb71df51&oe=5921282F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14088547_1075917775790269_5677353462165034660_n.jpg?oh=575240db410b0a692f0a2ed81e95dff3&oe=58E86F3A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1075917775790269&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-28T16:36:09+0000	1472402169	2016-08-28 18:36:09	7	3	10	0	13	3	1	2	1	0	7	0	0	0	0	3	0

As I was stood at the clothing checkout a lady passed out  as an off duty nurse I rushed to help. Your staff were quick to help  within minutes clothing rails were pulled round us to protect the ladies dignity and an ambulance called  2 first aiders arrived to help and blankets were taken off the shelves to put under her head  even a washing up bowl appeared after the lady said she felt sick! For my help the staff gave me a bunch of flowers - I nearly cried! People are quick to complain but I thought the staff and there actions today needed recognition  well done to all!

I was following it on a main road. He indicated to turn left and he did so I carried on driving and he decided to reverse into the main road. I had to swerve onto the other side of the road to avoid him. What made it worse was I had my 2 young kids in the car and my wife who I was taking to a&e for an injury to her shoulder and neck which this incident made worse. Went into the supermarket to speak to a duty manager. I explained all this to him. There was no eye contact. There was no apology or anything he was so cold didn t even ask how any of us were. I asked when the store manager was in to speak to and was just told he would be in some time tomorrow as he doesn t have any rota hours just comes in when he wants too. Apparantely this is the same for all tesco store managers.					2016-08-28T14:58:16+0000	1472396296	2016-08-28 16:58:16	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you please look into this matter as without insulin my son will die!!!!					2016-08-28T14:58:03+0000	1472396283	2016-08-28 16:58:03	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went through the checkout this morning and the guy didn t say a word to me the whole transaction! No  hello  please  thankyou  i even had to ask HIM how much i owed as he just sat there looking vacant after everything went through. I understand its not the best job in the world but when you work with the public  like i do myself as management  you HAVE to make an effort. Its really annoyed me all day  i really wish i d went to customer services at the time.					2016-08-28T14:53:58+0000	1472396038	2016-08-28 16:53:58	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  bought yesterday very good looking outside water melon but once opened it looked like still required to be in the field to grow and ripen. This happened several times but this time I have to announce it so other do not waste their hard earned cash.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14088477_10154570341289551_4397138245863171790_n.jpg?oh=14a3ce19d9aae3927975ff79e21eda55&oe=591D2654	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14088477_10154570341289551_4397138245863171790_n.jpg?oh=07c13f3bff7105c2f9b6e345a713bb8a&oe=58E41759	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154570341289551&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-28T14:45:40+0000	1472395540	2016-08-28 16:45:40	10	8	10	3	21	4	4	0	1	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

I came yesterday at around 3pm with my 4 year old daughter Chloe and 16 week old son Charlie. As i was putting all my shopping onto the conveyor belt my son started crying so i was trying to load my shopping asap. Jenny came over and said she would sort the shopping so i can give Charlie a cuddle. So jenny continued putting my shopping on and packed the food with my daughter Chloe whilst talking about scooby doo and the gruffalo! So friendly and helpful!

The shop assistants at Tesco are always polite and put the customer first  asking how the day is going and always wish me a nice day when I leave.... HOWEVER I have just been to Tesco  Coodock and quite frankly I am appalled!!! The toilets were extremely dirty  so much so that they couldn t be used  no toilet roll and the soap was in dirty containers. I collected a few items and went to pay at the tobacco till and 2 shop assistants were more interested with Facebook!! Even when I asked for a scratch card it took 2 attempts to get them to listen!! One of the ladies was pretending to serve me but was more interested in the phone screen!!!!					2016-08-28T14:33:54+0000	1472394834	2016-08-28 16:33:54	0	8	0	0	8	8	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst perusing the breakfast cereal i realised that my handbag zip was attached to the basket  somehow the loop had got caught around the grid and i could not get it out. A bit embarrassing really standing on your own attached to a basket pulling at it like a mad woman. Anyway  after asking the girls at the Customer Service desk for help (we tried brute force and tweezers but to no avail) and the lovely security guard having a try we finally ended up in Timpson s with wire cutters and a metal file. Victory! They saved my zip unscathed too. Thank you so much to the staff who freed me from my mini trauma without making me feel stupid.

I ve spoken to your support team and apparently this can t be done!  It s very common for an insurance company to want to verify that I m not claiming on a phone I do not own. Similarly if I had wanted to sell the phone on in the future.   I ve already spoken to my insurer and a VAT receipt will not suffice as it doesn t describe the unique identity of my phone.   Can you provide me with a document as proof of purchase  in my name  detailing the IMEI and SN  purchase date and purchase price?					2016-08-28T12:07:34+0000	1472386054	2016-08-28 14:07:34	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Under the disability discrimination act you have an obligation to protect us from discrimination.  Allowing able bodied motorists to park in disabled bays is considered to be discriminatory. The usual answer is there s nothing we can do  when in fact there s plenty you can do all it takes is the will to do it.  Get your act together Tesco  the disabled pay your wages too.					2016-08-28T11:27:55+0000	1472383675	2016-08-28 13:27:55	0	17	0	0	17	14	6	8	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will like to share my thoughts regarding one of your stores policies and here from head office if this is correct.   Last night at 22:56 my Gf and I tried to enter one of your stores.  The doors where already closed with a security guard guarding them fro  the inside.   I was able to get his attention and asked why the store is closed if it clearly states 6am-11pm.  He said we cannot come in and that the close the doors before 11pm.  So him and I had some words my telling him this isn t fair on the public.  He wouldn t  have any of it and made it very clear I would not enter even though I tried to enter to try and talk to a manager of the store.  I then had to go to an off licence down then Street.    The story does not end there.  When I finished in the off licence I walked out of that store and your security personal that closed the store when he felt like it was talking to a man waiting for a bus.  He failed to realise I was standing right there listening to him moaning about what just happened to him.  During his rant he mention how he was going to   punch me in the face   I felt then it was time to let him know I was standing there and heard what he was saying.  He then vented slightly and  I said no point talking to you I wanted to talk to the manager.  His reply to my was  do you think I work for some one? He then answered his own question by saying I don t I work for myself.  Get out    I could be wrong but would like to know are your stores allowed to close befor the stated time?					2016-08-28T11:24:52+0000	1472383492	2016-08-28 13:24:52	4	4	4	0	8	4	3	1	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

We purchased a DVD (The Wave) in Carluke and note...Title in English as with the rest of the cover. We returned home and found that the security tag had not been removed at Tesco and realising the security alarm did not go off. We thought oh well (we have the receipt) We then managed to open the security tab and proceeded to play the DVD. We were shocked to find the DVD was in Norwegian and immediately phoned Tesco Carluke and as we live in Lanark  they advised that if the Tesco in Lanark is a superstore like theirs  we would not have a problem in explaining what the problem was  after all  we noticed in VERY small pring on the back  it did mention  with english sub-titles  but the whole outer casing was in English! We did as suggested go to the Lanark Tesco and explained what had transpired  The security Tab  the language issue etc and was met with  sorry  but regulations state we do not accept a DVD if returned and no refund is possible   this after we said we would choose another DVD of the same value or more! Well  as mentioned  we will no longer be spending £400 pm at Tesco for our shopping and quite honestly  for a huge company to decline a £7.00 DVD refund or swop for another DVD is disgusting. Oh well Tesco  you ve lost yet another valued customer....Lidl and Morrisons here we come!					2016-08-28T10:27:15+0000	1472380035	2016-08-28 12:27:15	1	7	1	0	8	7	6	1	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just put lots of toys in my basket for my kids for Christmas  but when I went to check out it s making me choose delivery or click and collect for each item?! It s telling me click and collect is £2 for orders under £30 my order is over £30 but two of my items are delivery only and it s charging me delivery for one of those items too. It s telling me one package is too big to collect from my nearest tesco 😫 so I have to pay £6 delivery for one item  get free delivery for one item  and then have to pay £2 for the pleasure of going to a tesco miles away from me bringing my order to over £50!  If I choose the £3 delivery option instead of collecting it still charges per item bringing my order to over £55!  Losing the will  Amazon wouldn t charge per item for delivery 😞					2016-08-28T08:10:24+0000	1472371824	2016-08-28 10:10:24	0	11	0	0	11	11	2	9	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received a minced meat pattie with peppercorns on it that was mis advertised and mis sold! There was no steak what so ever and as a chef I could easily tell the difference. I am highly disappointed and I feel ripped off by yourselves and wonder how many other people have had this same experience! What does tesco intend to do about this as I am shocked by the poor quality of the product they have mis supplied their customers. Just wondering if I m the first to notice.					2016-08-27T22:21:26+0000	1472336486	2016-08-28 00:21:26	1	8	1	0	9	8	6	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We order our groceries online every week  but have struggled to find  sandwich fillers  for the past three weeks and  as much as we like an occasional tipple  I m not sure a good slug of cognac would go down too well between two slices of bread (and the Iggle Piggle toy that comes further down the list is probably not consumable). Is there a small animal in your search engine?  Also  how come your Value coffee has increased in price by 40% since last week?!

Recently when i was in one of my local stores (Wishaw) i bought a tub of Cow & gate milk desperate to get home and feed my girl.  The next day i went to use the milk i got i realise it was the wrong one i had picked up  but since it was completely sealed and i had my receipt for it i decided to ask for an exchange at another of my local stores (Carluke) where i was told they do not accept baby milk for returns or exchanges.  I find this quite irritating as your advert clearly states you would be willing to accept a return of a watermelon for a pineapple - which isn t really something you can get wrong. I have also read your terms and conditions where at no point does it state that baby milk is an item that s non refundable/exchangeable. Asides all of that i now have a tub of milk that is completely useless to me.  Attached is a link to your advert which i am sure you will find very helpful.   I would appreciate your clarification as i am confused and frustrated by this as I do not have money to throw away  particularly as I only require a like for like exchange.  	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCY36BHqVAPFc49&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4_o5X2I0v5s%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&cfs=1&sx=507&sy=0&sw=1080&sh=1080&_nc_hash=AQCfRCiGtsAkQd3w	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBi6GqYF_igghWr&w=720&h=720&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4_o5X2I0v5s%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&cfs=1&sx=507&sy=0&sw=1080&sh=1080&_nc_hash=AQBGefH8ZPfISBu1	https://youtu.be/4_o5X2I0v5s	youtu.be	2016-08-27T21:12:06+0000	1472332326	2016-08-27 23:12:06	0	31	0	0	31	29	8	21	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I accept the changing rooms are shut due to it being late  but on taking a pair of jeans back that are the wrong size (in an emergency as going away tomorrow first thing am) why the bloody hell is it OK for your staff to suggest (in front of her MALE colleagues) that I  just pop into the cafe because people shouldn t come in  to take my jeans off to try others on? A cafe where food is served  that is not closed off so anyone could walk in and is surrounded by floor to ceiling windows to the outside world  instead of allowing me the privacy of a toilet?!

The size that I want are out of stock in my local store and on the website so I emailed customer services to ask when they would be back in. I was told they weren t able to tell me that but as soon as they were back in  they would be available on the website. I checked every day for two weeks but still none available. I then emailed customer services again just to ask whether the trousers would definitely be coming back into stock  only to be told they also couldn t tell me that but as soon as they were  they would be available on the website. However I could try visiting some other tesco extra stores to see if they have them in. Helpful. Surely someone knows if they will come back into stock eventually or could check stores  stock and order me a pair to collect?					2016-08-27T20:40:12+0000	1472330412	2016-08-27 22:40:12	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tried to get past it in a standard width car and couldn t. Waited a few minutes whilst beeping and delivery driver didn t care less. He came back to the van and I asked him to move and he said that no one else had a problem (with a queue of cars waiting behind as well I don t know where he got that idea from). Really rude attitude and not at all apologetic for parking selfishly blocking the rude. Third time this has now happened to me? Are they all trained to not give any care to anyone else? It s clearly not an anomaly.  Eventually when he had finished taking his time delivering to this house on Stanley Avenue  St Albans at 16.25 27:08/16 he moved up the road and parked yet again horrifically up the curve on the corner of a junction blocking all visibility to oncoming cars. Amazing. Less aggressive than the last guy that did similar when I asked them to move and was then followed home and swore his face off at my 90 year old grandma on private property.. So admittedly an improvement from my last tesco driver experience but seriously  why does this keep happening???	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14102664_10154469924029579_8999482549748326846_n.jpg?oh=541807b5970a4508b12f1e89fc6d8c8c&oe=5919374C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14102664_10154469924029579_8999482549748326846_n.jpg?oh=004858e07c54cc2025809b148a6f3181&oe=58D64E38	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154469924029579&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-27T19:03:39+0000	1472324619	2016-08-27 21:03:39	2	9	2	0	11	9	5	4	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Despite going back to the shop for a hunt we just couldn t find him. Big thank you to the staff for helping us look especially Tommy who was really helpful.

I arrived at the store to be told that there was no bike and when they checked the order number there was no record of the purchase  they phoned the click and collect who informed them that they had confirmed the order but had no record of any type of delivery. You can understand my frustration that my sons birthday was the following day and having no money to make another purchase of a bike and being told the refund would take up to five days  i have no money to buy my son a bike  he will be wakening tomorrow expecting a bike that I don t have because of your company and no money to buy another one  I am devastated and heart broke my sons 5th birthday is ruined thanx to your company  I look forward to your reply as I am not letting this issue drop					2016-08-27T17:24:33+0000	1472318673	2016-08-27 19:24:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got the new pole put in and that one snapt straight away also  rang tesco to say I wanted my money back so the lady said to take the trampoline down and ring them back when it s down  to which I did for a man to say I had to re box the full trampoline or they wouldn t take it and I d only get 10 pound back and he didn t know why the lady didn t tell me that  so I manged to get some boxes and box it all up. Rang tesco up on Friday 20th August for a collection day  I said I couldn t do Monday so he said Tuesday I said yeah that s fine. Gets home Monday to a card to say they had been  so I rang back up and he didn t know why they came out and offered Tuesday for them to come I said yes  a man turns up on the morning with a car full of stuff I said I have 5 large boxes (2 trampoline s) he said oh ill have to get a van here  so I sat in till 7pm and noone came in a van  rings tesco back up and he said sorry how about tomorrow (wedesnday) I said yes  so I sat again all day to noone coming to collect. Yet again rings then back just after 7pm and he gave me the number for Yodel  I rang them (automated system) on thursday morning and got today Saturday for collection to come home Thursday night to a card that they had been for trampoline s  (don t know why because they said Saturday) I have now been sat waiting since 7am for someone to collect as they said today  I can t ring them as like I said it s automated system and tesco weren t much help  if they don t turn up this will be three days I ve sat and waited for them. I have to ring tesco if they don t come and they will investigate it and ring someone within there department as they can t do that now because they could turn up  this is absolute joke  ease I ve already waited in two day s! My poor daughter only got to play on it for one day and that was June   it s now nearly end of august and it s not like it s a daft amount of money it s £70.... I will never order anything from tesco direct again because this has been a right carry on					2016-08-27T15:54:10+0000	1472313250	2016-08-27 17:54:10	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst the price is very clear  the product name/information is minuscule.  Who on earth at Tesco thought that they were a good idea and signed them off to be introduced? This decision must have been taken at a strategic level and it s shocking.  This photo was taken with the camera six inches from the label and they are still very difficult to read. How do you expect the elderly or partially sighted to manage? Compared to the old ones they are terrible. There are more photos for comparison in the comments  the amount of space on them which could be filled with large  bold text is a waste. Go back to the old ones please until you ve sorted this out!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14088606_10154422215683618_7602699852109441806_n.jpg?oh=b08843a925bee1ada0421194f7a891cc&oe=58E83BB0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14088606_10154422215683618_7602699852109441806_n.jpg?oh=e8136d59a9a88ffca3d790f77e96e9c1&oe=58DBC2BD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154422215683618&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-27T15:26:49+0000	1472311609	2016-08-27 17:26:49	2	8	2	0	10	7	6	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

When he returned to his van I requested he leave more room for pedestrians to pass and was told he couldn t as he needed to park on the path so his van did not get hit! I told him the path was not to park on but to walk on and it was better his van get hit than my little girl at which point he just ignored me! I was shocked by his response and attitude.  I attach a pic of his parking as proof of just how inconsiderate it was!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14079535_10154458971664486_8122467221276239519_n.jpg?oh=8801e8380a107a53ac5d0c1194f75f72&oe=58DAFD18	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14079535_10154458971664486_8122467221276239519_n.jpg?oh=d8ea573a3aa8f5dedd524be7e41f1add&oe=59189F15	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154458971664486&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-27T15:18:07+0000	1472311087	2016-08-27 17:18:07	2	5	3	0	8	5	1	4	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

A young male assistant kindly checked and an order was arriving through the night. Due to this being an often letdown  he offered to have delivered to my house  4 bags prepaid. On arrival today  sadly none had arrived instore  but staff had put your other brand and Catsan in for me to choose  at no extra cost. I went for yours  as just as good a quality and why the only brand I have used for many years. To my surprise also a beautiful bunch of flowers  as a sorry from Tesco. I would like to say  a big thankyou  for excellent Customer Service from both the young guy instore and the young guy who delivered. Was like stepping back in time  to the caring 80/90 s Tesco  we used to so love. Hope will now continue to be of this exceptional standard and you will thank all involved.

Whoever came up with that bright idea wants sacked  common sense tells you click and collect orders encourage people to grocery shop upon collecting their order. This is nothing more than a cheap tactic of attempting to rip off the customer  I hope your sales slumped as a side effect!					2016-08-27T14:31:44+0000	1472308304	2016-08-27 16:31:44	2	5	2	0	7	5	3	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wondered if you guys could enlighten me as to why your policy when using club card vouchers online differs drastically to in store transactions? Today my wife had ordered a shop  and had delightfully told me that using our club card vouchers had managed to get £37.36 of shopping for the amazing low price of 86p. (Just to save you time on your calculator  that s £36.50 of vouchers!) Now I can imagine like myself  you re thinking  that s a pretty sweet deal! Unfortunately it was too good to last! The wife received a phone call from you  saying that our card had been declined  which was odd because we had just moved £30 into the account yesterday to cover petrol and shopping! Upon calling customer services she was told she had to pay £33 for the shopping! (Literally no idea where this number was pulled from) When she said it was meant to be 86p  the customer service team decided to play what can only be described as  guess the number   and proceeded to change the amount owed 3 different times before settling back around the £33 mark.  So what happened to the vouchers I hear you cry? Well apparently your policy is to take full payment before refunding the vouchers at a later date. (Which to clarify isn t explained anywhere on the confirmation email  not even in really tiny writing!) So here s the thing  why would you take the full amount to refund it back? If I went to a store and used my vouchers at the till  and then was told I d have to pay the full amount and wait on the refund  well  I don t think anyone would be happy with that!  So why the difference? Why haven t you displayed this policy anywhere on the confirmation email?  This is now the second time my family have had to drive the 15 miles to the nearest Tesco just because your online service is appalling. Just check mumsnet  you will see we re not the only ones Sort it out					2016-08-27T13:59:32+0000	1472306372	2016-08-27 15:59:32	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought them anyway as a treat. I looked online for them to review them and couldn t find them which I m guessing means they are a trial product. They are awful. Four slices  one of them has so much gelatine in you could bounce it from end of the kitchen to the other and is very unpleasant to eat and two of them are set so hard i couldn t put a fork through them so they were just dried out mousse.

Tesco you really need to look into your security agency employers and the  service  they provide. Being stopped at the exit of Tesco Earls Court with the phrase  I SAW you pay for only one  and then being man handled without any reason and not being asked for the receipt is definitely not what I expected from today s shopping trip. Why didn t you SEE that the cashier checked the rest of items already(which were paid for) and why did you not ask for my receipt. Very disappointed by this. On a plus side the management on site were helpful with dealing with the situation! But no more weekly shopping for me in Tesco if that s how I m going to be treated.					2016-08-27T13:23:00+0000	1472304180	2016-08-27 15:23:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will not pay this and I will make sure I never shop in Tesco again.

I spend far too long down the aisle and get that rather excited about the new products on offer.  However  it took me far too long to find the frozen section (needle and haystack) there is no visible   quick looking signage and it feels like it is constantly moving around in the freezer section. Please larger signs :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14054010_10157492899530372_6431739777505880697_n.jpg?oh=70f0c9c798288da2c1ff469ddcfad1a1&oe=58E291F7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14054010_10157492899530372_6431739777505880697_n.jpg?oh=7341f7e9f8ea945cbe8711084ac43586&oe=58EB4CFA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157492899530372&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-27T12:45:32+0000	1472301932	2016-08-27 14:45:32	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

The stay fresh white bread which pleases all the family.  50% of the loaf with crust and 50% without.  The only problem is we all like crusts in our house. We have inspected package well and unfortunately no crust fairies could be found. Our son was slightly upset as now his hair won t go wavy but hopefully he won t be too traumatised. Could you please ask the crust fairies to visit our house to put the crusts back on  Many thanks	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14063898_10157249761005214_777575841022429147_n.jpg?oh=95a092353ecbda2ec06ca37dd2fc9c91&oe=591BE9F6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14063898_10157249761005214_777575841022429147_n.jpg?oh=19a63118cd47b03ea3a0a77092de6fa0&oe=58E849E3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157249761005214&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-27T12:43:12+0000	1472301792	2016-08-27 14:43:12	0	3	2	1	6	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

Then the customer sometimes fails to take their receipt with them for proof if they had to return the item or more owing to being faulty.

Now I did not request to have it  and right now I m not needing to order from tesco  and I m sure this would stop me from having any free trials in the future when I may actually be interested in using it.. no point me trialling a service that I don t need right now. What worries me is if I don t cancel this in time it seems I then may be charged for a service I didn t request.

Plenty of time to get it with still just under a couple of weeks to go before he starts back. I also have your club card  which  I save all my points for Xmas so any money off vouchers I do get are valuable to me as the only ones I do receive now are ones to get extra points. I picked up 3 packs of 2 short sleave shirts for him. I wanted to also get his trousers from you for the points but unfortunately you d sold out of his age size. Got a few other bits that I needed and went to pay. Everything went through the till as normal and then the problem was the voucher. Could you possibly tell me who s idea is it to have a money off voucher for school valid until the 14th August? When clearly most schools go back in September and with my case cannot purchase uniform until the end of August as I have a child who s birthday is at the beginning. No sorry from the advisor  just took the voucher and threw it away when he could clearly see I was quite annoyed with the situation. Yes it s only £3  but that could be a loaf of bread and 4 pint of milk to someone that needed it from their change of buying the uniform. This is a rookie mistake in my opinion and feel that this needs to be revised for next year. Thank you.					2016-08-27T07:19:36+0000	1472282376	2016-08-27 09:19:36	0	18	0	0	18	18	4	14	13	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I paid £197 for two pairs of glasses they arrived to start with fairly quickly. I advised them three times (by going into store and calling the main head office) that I couldn t see. Finally I am told by the head office just pop back to the store they ll retest you yeah right!  No I had to come back a few days later after a major operation I did not need to be making my fourth trip to the optician. But I did to find out that the optician had written the axis as 15 instead of 115 I was offered a bunch of flowers for my trouble at the time I just wanted my glasses so I said no please just get my glasses sorted. Now I have made several calls to the rubbish liars at customer services head office as in the mean time I ve had to love house but my glasses have to go to the original store first.  20 days later my clear pair arrive at Northampton I m called as they need to send them to Ely. They get to Ely three days later to find out that the sun glasses (bearing in mind the hot weather is almost over now) haven t been made yet!!! So I call customer rubbish sorry services again at head office no they haven t been made no due date I ll get a regional manager to call you here I am 5 days later no call!!! Ha ha ha then I m asked to do a customer satisfaction questionnaire are you kidding me!!! Yes in still 26 days later have no second pair no idea when they will arrive and no customer service at all. The clear pair are uncomfortable and not worth the money  My advice better service and glasses at Specsavers don t even bother with Tescos!!! I played nice till now and now I ve had enough please feel free to share my experience as I would hate for other people to suffer such a poor service.					2016-08-27T02:39:03+0000	1472265543	2016-08-27 04:39:03	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is now after midnight and my groceries have not arrived. There has been no phone call or explanation. I have young children so I will need to be up early. I have stayed up and waited in case there were unforeseen circumstances and the driver was late and unable to get in touch with me but this is beyond a joke! My contact telephone number is obviously on my order paperwork and for my order to just not arrive with no communication is totally unacceptable. I have paid for my groceries and do not have them!					2016-08-26T23:09:39+0000	1472252979	2016-08-27 01:09:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You buy cases of wine in 6 s and take them out of the box. Then you pay someone to drive the cardboard hundreds of miles to a recycling plant where they turn them into wine carriers. You then ship them hundreds of miles back to the store and offer us discounts when we buy 6 bottles. You even print please recycle on the carrier. Thanks in confusion.					2016-08-26T22:22:52+0000	1472250172	2016-08-27 00:22:52	2	12	2	0	14	12	4	8	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

But what we didn t realise was how much 😁😁  Sam and Jay   part of our team of volunteers   went to collect the donation. The donation was massive !!  Tins of food  biscuits  drinks  sauces  pasta  cake mixes  tuna  pickles  toiletries ....... You name it   it was there!!  We have shared this massive donation with Mad Dogs Street Project and took 3 full car loads with another trip tomorrow .  This could not of come at a better time for us. The food bank was in need of replenishment and Christmas is coming . This will make such a difference to a lot of people over the next few months.  Connections with businesses like Tesco are invaluable for charities and organisations like Coffee4craig and Mad Dogs.  Thank you so much Alex and Simon for helping tonight and thank you so much Tesco Extra Stretford					2016-08-26T22:02:22+0000	1472248942	2016-08-27 00:02:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a cake 2 weeks ago for my daughters birthday party tomorrow.  I had it personalised and had a phone call to confirm spellings of what I wanted etc. I spent £40 on this cake and spent a month looking for the perfect cake.  Your staff sent me and my 2 year old to 6 different departments and 2 different stores  accused me of collecting on the wrong day  not knowing my own name and finally  after TWO HOURS of explaining and showing proof of the order number and giving all my details  they finally found the cake in the locked and closed click and collect hub (the first place I asked them to look!)  If that wasn t enough. We got it home  unwrapped it  it is missing one of the pillars  the princess looks like a banana  it has melted slightly  is lopsided AND my daughters name is spelt wrong.   I spent £40 on a non personalised banana leaning castle.  I can t even begin to tell you how stressed I am. It s 22:30 and I arrived in store at 19:00.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14080029_769315399837551_6881675391147902364_n.jpg?oh=da20ef5955eabac619ff925c0f191131&oe=591FF795	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14080029_769315399837551_6881675391147902364_n.jpg?oh=6ac94f45f5a008deb465b51cdd1f8f69&oe=591BCA6A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=769315399837551&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-26T21:28:51+0000	1472246931	2016-08-26 23:28:51	1	22	7	0	29	20	5	15	20	0	1	0	0	0	0	6	0

Tonight Denise and I mixed it up a bit and had your carbonara chicken for the first time. As someone who hates mushrooms (they fill you up too much  once you eat them there s naw mush-room for anything else) and is always wary of supermarket chicken after the toenail dilemma of  99 I can honestly say it was a taste sensation. We washed it down with your  chunky chips  better know as fat boys that take double the time to cook and they re still rock solid and a bottle (glass) of coke..... purely belter!! I then had the Amazonian Cheesecake which was superb  I got a slight tingle when I swallowed and swear I heard a parrot noise after every bite.... Aware Morrisons are tough competition as their cooked brekkies make yours look like a home-ec class gone wrong and asda with their affordable alcohol and fresh bakery (rolls are all warm and cuddly) so you must be finding it tough. Dine for a ten spot works and we will be back  next time try and make sure you ve stock of the flatbread and the creature packing the shelves doesn t abuse me for taking the chunky chips not in the deal instead of taking the chunky chips in the deal when the only difference is the colour of the text on your below par packaging and an excuse for death breath to verbally abuse me for apparently being colour blind. This is a step-up from the old days when you were used for buying spice girls singles and grapefruit and the only way is up...... Yours faithfully  Kennie					2016-08-26T21:27:38+0000	1472246858	2016-08-26 23:27:38	35	18	51	2	71	18	17	1	29	0	35	0	0	16	0	0	0

As it had your logo on I gave it a shot so so hopeful that it might be real as that grocery money would make a real difference to my family s life at the moment. I answered the market research questions and it said to enter my number etc to receive the voucher. It didn t send me to a page to do this when I clicked. So... I m assuming that was a scam or just a way to dupe people into doing your survey? A touch cruel there if it is Tesco. Really thought that was a lucky break in everything.					2016-08-26T18:55:48+0000	1472237748	2016-08-26 20:55:48	0	4	0	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We really needed a swimsuit for my son...but you had none of those in his size either...but the bathing suits for girls were plentiful.

I was in the upstairs department and was about to descend down when a group of big burly managers came out onto shop floor (there was 3 or 4 of them ) and started mouthing off at a younger member of staff ...  I was so shocked I turned around and told this bloke (stocky man in his 50 s) how he should take work matters behind closed doors and off shop floor ... I got a  what?  .. so I repeated myself (was a bit worried at the fact they were all big burly men in manager shirts) but I wasn t prepared to walk by and allow them to belittle the staff whom actually are the backbone behind that shop ... the manager didn t even answer me ( think he was a bit shocked a woman was putting him in his place) but I was very disappointed by this  managers    behaviour on shop floor ... not what I would expect of someone in management .... think perhaps they need some training on how and where  to talk to their staff appropriately...					2016-08-26T17:16:17+0000	1472231777	2016-08-26 19:16:17	20	13	20	3	36	12	5	7	3	0	20	0	0	0	0	0	0

I amended my order and my son sat here and saw me check out however I did not receive my final amended order.  Also received some cracked eggs.   The lady I spoke to called Shannon was totally unhelpful and didnt sound like she cared at all.   Also along with that the amount of items thats were missing was disgusting.   She was not at all bothered when I informed her that I will not be shopping at Tescos again.   I have disabilities so this is the reason why I shop online.   I never have a problem with Morrisons I will continue to use them from now on.   As the last few times I have used Tesco I have experienced problems.					2016-08-26T17:10:09+0000	1472231409	2016-08-26 19:10:09	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Monday  I bought loads of supplies for the new term at our Beaver Scout Colony  but the receipt blew away in the car park and I couldn t catch it.  Today Raeesha managed to find a copy of the receipt for me  and left it for me to collect at customer services after her shift had finished. Fantastic customer service  she really didn t have to help us as it was my fault for losing the receipt  but now we have one for our accounts (very important as a charity!) Please make sure she s rewarded in some way!					2016-08-26T16:51:26+0000	1472230286	2016-08-26 18:51:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We come down stairs go to checkout to be told need to take to customer services at the other end of the store. So misleading information already then when we get to customer service the BRAND NEW GAME is out of stock if this was the case why is it on the shelf!!!

I used it with our little one and folded it up and put it in his room to store. I got it out today to pass on to someone else and noticed that the stitching has all come undone in a vital part of the crib. It would have been likely like that when our little one was using it but I did not see it as its on the underside.  I ve spoken to who bought it for us and they no longer have proof of purchase.   What can I do about this? It s unsafe for me to pass on for another baby to use.   You still sell the item on your tesco direct site.   Please could you advise if I could take this back to a local store with a tesco direct counter and obtain a credit voucher for the amount as obviously the item is faulty and not fit for purpose or of satisfactory quality as it was only used for a couple Months (our boy was an early roller and quite long so grew out of it quite quickly!)   I ve attached screen shots of the crib on your website (different colour) and the faulty seam.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14068085_10154337012103726_1533837148974825800_n.jpg?oh=f841bd767711582f934282055f15e5fb&oe=58EFDEEE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14068085_10154337012103726_1533837148974825800_n.jpg?oh=e69de499dd0b977c6cedee5925ff579e&oe=592327E3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154337012103726&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-26T16:23:44+0000	1472228624	2016-08-26 18:23:44	0	6	0	0	6	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My autistic son was given £10 by his grandparents for very good behaviour  so today he bought the multi loop track set with it. However it seems you need a PhD in engineering to construct it as the instructions make little sense and also the laws of physics get in the way of what the car is supposed to be doing!  It s now taken two of us to attempt to build the track and this my partner cursing under his breath whilst applying mathematical principles in an attempt to build it. I think at any point soon a grown man may just cry.  But in all seriousness I have a very disappointed little boy.

Female  blonde driver  was on her phone and paying no attention to the changing traffic lights or the traffic. Myself and other pedestrians could not cross safely when the green man came on.  I didn t have the chance to log the number plate or van number but it was about 10.45am on Morisson Street.  Totally shocking behaviour by one of your drivers. 😡					2016-08-26T14:05:01+0000	1472220301	2016-08-26 16:05:01	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was so lovely and asked both of my children if they would like something   my eldest isn t a fruit eater but the youngest loves fruit! Mat trotted off and came back with a banana  he saved the trip Oliver happily ate the banana and order was restored   A stark contrast to another member of staff who walked by and commented  oh he must be tired  ( yeh mummy too) !   Just want to say a huge thank you to Mat for helping me this morning   retail staff are never thanked enough for their hard work and dedication to their jobs ..... He is a credit to the Gloucester store . Thank you again .					2016-08-26T13:41:50+0000	1472218910	2016-08-26 15:41:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However this lovely man made my day as he greeted me by saying  Can I just say you re absolutely blooming  such a lovely bump!!   As I was having a particularly rubbish feeling day and even had sunglasses on to hide my face  this was lovely to hear. He then continued to chat away about my pregnancy and wished me luck before I left.

We used self scan which the store is promoting  we had done all the shopping and was at the till all i had was a chicken that wouldn t scan and the lady worker had to scan a full trolly of shopping for one customer  I waited and she walked past me twice then a second customer had to have all her shopping re scanned the whole trolly of shopping I was left waiting again. Why are you trying to promote self scan then have to have the whole shopping re scanned. It is ridicules when you only have one member of staff working that part of the store.					2016-08-26T11:43:35+0000	1472211815	2016-08-26 13:43:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been buying my lunch at least one a week in this store since before it was even tesco  and although it s never been a fantastic selection I feel that recently options have been reduced  especially in the drinks that are included in the meal deal. In comparison to other tesco stores that I use regularly this one is definitely below par in the lunchtime meal deal area.					2016-08-26T11:32:45+0000	1472211165	2016-08-26 13:32:45	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was happy to see options like the houmous and carrot sticks/falafals and as shown  the vegetable samosa.  I am however disappointed to see that Koko milk is no longer in the milk fridge aisle.

Seems a general trend does this so I ordered a click and collect order so we could pick up shopping and go camping for the bank holiday weekend  the man comes out with no prosecco says there isn t any substitutions  don t believe him for a second so I rang customer service to complain about not being offered a substitution and now having to go into store anyway to buy wine that should have been brought out with the rest of the stuff  he rings the store and says I have spoke with Owen and he assures me there s enough prosecco for you to go into store and receive the offer of 25% off  so what he s telling me means it is there they just didn t substitute me any probably because it was more expensive and they don t want to price match it!!! Absolutely disgusted that there is stock they just didn t bother to bring it out  like I say more down to cost than customer service!!! Disgrace  thanks for nothing but an inconvenience tesco  oh and the five pound customer service offered me you know what you can do with that!!!! 😡😡😡	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14046082_10210148511410685_2550830128041718167_n.jpg?oh=364cb6cd3d44c8ece9c27888d1248b0d&oe=58E12C1F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14046082_10210148511410685_2550830128041718167_n.jpg?oh=fdb1b6999808c8a08480ab2aae925ec6&oe=58E3B36B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210148511410685&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-26T10:51:55+0000	1472208715	2016-08-26 12:51:55	0	13	0	0	13	13	4	9	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m currently sat in your feeding/changing room in your Wisbech store and I have to say I m not that impressed. I d normally feed her in the cafe and enjoy a nice drink but the way she s been screaming lately I thought it was better to have a bit of privacy. The chair in here is filthy and stained and not very comfy (arms can be handy when you re breastfeeding)  there are no liners for the changing mat and you have a drinking water tap but no cups to use it. It wouldn t take much to make it a more pleasant area for everyone that uses it.					2016-08-26T10:41:19+0000	1472208079	2016-08-26 12:41:19	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

They put a smile on my face this morning with the little message on the phone  telling me that because it was my truth delivery  i would find a card and a gift in my shop. And then when the lovely driver delivery man brought it in  i found a lovelycard  and a gorgeous box of rather lovely chocolates  and my smile became a big cheesy grin of delight!! Thank you guys - it is a lovely thing to do  and i really appreciate the gesture. Unfortunately it is a fast day today  but all bets are off over bank holiday weekend  and hubby and are going to tuck in greedily!

Eg. Bike helmets off at petrol station and get off the bike when filling  was first told it was policy  ITS NOT  I called and was then told it was the law  ITS NOT!!! (Ask any biker  and then ask hoe easy it is to fill when not sat on it)  And then healthy start vouchers every store will take them as long as you know you won t get change if you don t use full amount on the vouchers (e.g £3.10 voucher I found £3 worth of stuff). Tesco refused to take it and also refused to search for a piece of fruit valued at 10p  saying its not their job to do that. So I couldnt get ANYTHING as I had no change on me! They then told me it was a Healthy Start policy. ITS NOT!!!! I have called them.  The staff have been rude and lazy and fail to know how to use any of the self service machines when you have a problem. My daughter had to wait a whole extra hour for her breakfast (didn t realise I had run out) because I spent about 30mins arguing with them in the store.  They don t get managers and will only let you speak a  supervisor  who seems just as clueless. I ve seen them standing round in groups talking whilst customers have been trying to get their attention  self service workers are no where to be seen most of the time so your stood there with the red light flashing like an idiot!  Plus the amount of times I ve tried to buy something and it wasn t supposed to be on the shelves  and yet 2weeks later it s still there fully stocked and priced  I end up spending more money!  And this is just the Callington store!   I know this is a rant but as admittedly your cheaper and you have more variety then the other local supermarket  I use Tesco more so I find all this frustrating. I don t however do large shops in Tesco now  I recommend go further and using Morrisons! (I have friends that work in this store so I hope you understand how difficult it is for me to put this up too)					2016-08-26T09:29:38+0000	1472203778	2016-08-26 11:29:38	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This evening me and my partner wanted broccoli as an accompaniment to our dinner  a favourite veg of ours.   So i went to your express store on Holdenhurst road and bought some. I took it home  cut it into chunks and placed it in my steamer beneath some garden peas.  As i dished up the beloved greenery  my heart sank. There  resting on top of a broccoli floret was a caterpillar.  I had steamed it to death. Or at least i can only assume i did.  Was it dead before it went in the pan? I honestly don t know how to deal with this pain of unknowing. On closer inspection i found another  this time tiny little caterpillar  in a cocoon type thing. A baby. I did this to a baby.  I couldn t bring myself to search the brocolli for more fatalities  so i ate my dinner with no brocolli  almost in tears. This has been the worst day of my life.  So  how do we go about rectifying this tragic evening? Please find attached a graphic image of the deceased.  Regards   Ruby	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14045802_10154485960361983_7283505975533973371_n.jpg?oh=573e6af897a35992885c939b7cb7d6da&oe=58E7F362	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14045802_10154485960361983_7283505975533973371_n.jpg?oh=4c28de5cb26f5d79cb221503a7a58e12&oe=58DC386F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154485960361983&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-25T20:43:40+0000	1472157820	2016-08-25 22:43:40	20	14	24	2	40	14	7	7	10	0	20	0	0	0	4	0	0

In the MK wolverton store today we were welcomed by the fruit basket you had out saying for the kids to pick something from apples - bananas or satsumas for the trip around! This is a bloody brilliantly idea being as I have two small children who are fruit addicts! Thank you for making the time less painful 👏🍏🍌🍊					2016-08-25T20:30:04+0000	1472157004	2016-08-25 22:30:04	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a set of golf clubs for my sons birthday which is today. I paid an extra £2 to collect them at my local store (20 miles away) only to get an email after I arrived in Inverness to say they d been deliver to the wrong store! I phoned customer service and the nice lady told me the store in which they d been delivered too would hold them till Sunday but I will have to collect  it s an hour and a half away!! The golf clubs are no longer in stock so I can t re-order. Very disappointed to tell our 7 year old that part of his birthday present hasn t come 😥 😡😡					2016-08-25T20:22:14+0000	1472156534	2016-08-25 22:22:14	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We are very pleased that the member of your staff mentioned in the screen shot below called again this evening  mainly so we could thank him personally as you did not bother to give him so much as a pat on the back. He had been told of this post by a family member but nothing from you as his employer. You should be ashamed. Companies should recognise & reward good staff. They are on your front line & without them you wouldn t have any business. You should also be grateful for the publicity  over 300 people interacted with that post & was seen by thousands. Maybe you will return my pm that you requested and at last recognise this chap.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14022217_10209976555635051_5910502347498896122_n.jpg?oh=e5cdf6c6c75318b517a62bb3d77b58f8&oe=591E84E5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14022217_10209976555635051_5910502347498896122_n.jpg?oh=eb0c97a3bc212ce19df882c50121af87&oe=58E49BE8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209976555635051&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-25T20:21:42+0000	1472156502	2016-08-25 22:21:42	18	7	21	0	28	7	2	5	0	0	18	3	0	0	0	0	0

It would be so useful to us!! Especially now you ve moved all the shelves around! Now  I totally get that you want us to wander around aimlessly looking for things  impulse buying as we go  but really  that app would be so useful!!					2016-08-25T20:19:49+0000	1472156389	2016-08-25 22:19:49	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

You are Britain s top retailer and your values suggest you are  Making a positive contribution to the communities where we operate . I think in the UK s uncertain economic climate it s good to source produce locally where possible  and in terms of the literal climate it s good to purchase items that haven t had to be freighted across the globe  also where possible.  So  when in the UK in the UK s biggest retailer  who sell 77% of their products in the UK  looking at apples and pears  (something the UK produces hundreds of thousands of tonnes of every year)  sitting under a sign that proudly boasts  UK apples and pears are best now   I was pretty annoyed to see that not one single variety of pear and not one single variety of apple was from the UK.  There was Gala  Braeburn  Jazz  Granny Smith  Pink Lady  Golden Delicious  Bramley  Kazi... maybe even more... a lot of stock  a lot of varieties  but not one was a British apple or a British pear.  The majority were from New Zealand  South Africa  Italy  and even Chile  Why?   The signage is misleading and your brand values don t stack up to what s getting put on the shelves in this regard.  Where s all the British fruit and why aren t you selling it?					2016-08-25T20:16:27+0000	1472156187	2016-08-25 22:16:27	1	10	1	0	11	10	3	7	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I reported the incident in store to customer service and the two ladies were of great help  I was then approached by the duty manager who was only interested in protocol and had no interest in the well being of my son. I was promised a call back by the duty manager and someone from the incident centre within 24 hours  still not had a call back. I then called Tesco customer service and again the service was ridiculous and was then told they couldn t deal with me and was given another number for the incident centre in Dundee  all they seemed to care about was how I got the number for them  after a ten minute lecture from them I was promised a call back with 48 hours and still no response! I have been a loyal customer with Tesco for many years doing my groceries fuel and banking and the service I have received has been disgraceful	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14141700_1064590103609906_748174119502704593_n.jpg?oh=293df4693e78d568add4914ea67dfc19&oe=59186036	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14141700_1064590103609906_748174119502704593_n.jpg?oh=63cc2f9cb0804cda2d56855f8de3372a&oe=58ECCFC9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1064590103609906&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-25T19:58:12+0000	1472155092	2016-08-25 21:58:12	13	23	26	83	132	22	19	3	23	0	13	0	1	0	1	11	0

Bought at Tesco South Wigston  Leicester at around 11:35am 21/8/16	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14040179_10208596440687089_3344853621008594332_n.jpg?oh=a719da5551aa73da63fb853368f9180e&oe=58E521F0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14040179_10208596440687089_3344853621008594332_n.jpg?oh=2fff961bc3ba408a3df44f81969f7157&oe=58EECFFD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208596440687089&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-25T19:10:45+0000	1472152245	2016-08-25 21:10:45	2	11	2	0	13	10	3	7	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just visited your Portsmouth Fratton supermarket where I saw an employee taking all the unsold fresh bread  products  (rolls  French sticks  etc) off of the shelves and cramming them into pink bags labelled  not fit for human consumption . Just minutes ago they were on the shelf for sale. This is a shocking waste. I am sure there are food banks and homeless charities that would happily take them off your hands. Simply shocking.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14089208_10157270016690231_8976805700066634913_n.jpg?oh=c6948bcdeb21f0c7ddad3ffe7aed7b4d&oe=5922C072	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14089208_10157270016690231_8976805700066634913_n.jpg?oh=4020d5e9905a16e2a8fc020b644e64a1&oe=58E7F97F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157270016690231&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-25T18:32:22+0000	1472149942	2016-08-25 20:32:22	9	7	15	4	26	6	6	0	4	0	9	0	0	0	0	6	0

I telephone from Bulgaria and am told it s driver discretion and they will try to resolve this... All they did was ring my son and ask him to find someone over 18..  which is not possible. I telephone again just now and they tell me that they won t deliver and its tough...

I went to my mums to check if you d delivered my daughters 2 birthday presents today  I found this note. My mums front garden leads straight onto a busy road  directly opposite a business Park.  You can see the whole garden from the road  so no surprise when I went to look  behind the bins  to find my parcel wasn t there. It s my daughters 4th birthday in a week and her present now missing! Not impressed at all. Any one of the neighbours would ve taken in the parcel but instead your delivery men think it s acceptable to leave it out in the garden on a day when it s rained several times.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14045938_10154255626791391_8673046181915279096_n.jpg?oh=389d37c0baa21df441dbdf0b3bf0fccd&oe=591BD419	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14045938_10154255626791391_8673046181915279096_n.jpg?oh=8a9b1dd9b1c3cb2641cf0b7762153523&oe=5922D714	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154255626791391&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-25T15:01:09+0000	1472137269	2016-08-25 17:01:09	0	11	1	0	12	11	7	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Sure has to be a win-win-win scenario for Tesco (first UK superstore to adopt a reduction in the production of plastic  imagine the marketing...)  for the environment (how many less plastic bags are going to end up out there) and for the consumers who are doing something for the environment with their every day shopping.

Goodness knows how ill he is going to be now. Returned to the store and had 4 other cakes removed from the shelf. Another 4 people who could have been potentially really ill. Not good enough Tesco.

(But a course closer to me would be good - we had to travel and hour each way to get to a course.)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14079756_10210398737984219_5691398009002125101_n.jpg?oh=bd1d19cf18daa7952d6e5af4c7deecbc&oe=58EA850C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14079756_10210398737984219_5691398009002125101_n.jpg?oh=90859b4298cdd7ba0ff579c3a57207bf&oe=58EFAB78	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210398737984219&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-25T14:10:20+0000	1472134220	2016-08-25 16:10:20	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I kid you not the base was harder than the box  their was virtually no tomato sauce on it and the topping had literally been thrown on in a pile the onions were completely raw as well.

After the 2 previous complaints & posts on here relating to their potatoes I bought these this morning. 2 out of 4 are inedible & I know admin here will encourage me to take them back to the store but that is no good to me when I am at work now & bought these to make my dinner with. Also messaging the managers at the Seacroft store in Leeds will not help as they are usually too busy standing around gossiping about Liverpool FC.

The lack of security questions I was asked when I called them up to sort it out was almost none existent!  This makes me think...  what if the fraudsters call Tesco up and say that they haven t received their legoland tickets and that I am the fake person?  will I need to do all this again?

I understand that to most people this is a small amount of money but if this is a regular occurance at your pumps it could amount to a large amount of extra revenue to Tesco. I also feel that I have had money now removed from my account that I did not request as I contracted at the pump for petrol valued at £40  not £40.08p. Has anyone else experienced this?

Also what happened to the old item scanners that used to be dotted around the store?the one useful thing has been removed.several times I have been to the checkout only to discover the item is more expensive due to it being put in the wrong place. Come on tesco sort all this out sainsbury is looking more enticing at the moment.!!					2016-08-25T09:33:17+0000	1472117597	2016-08-25 11:33:17	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The flag is a clear symbol for people to see when choosing a product and some people have reading problems or like myself find it more convenient to see the flag and pick up the product. Would like to see this stupid decision to remove the saltire being put right from an annoyed customer who shops in tesco everyday  but can quite easily shop elsewhere					2016-08-25T08:03:57+0000	1472112237	2016-08-25 10:03:57	4	0	6	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	4	2	0	0	0	0	0

England votes for brexit  so we re now allowed to be overtly racist instead of closet racist. England complains of a Scottish flag on products therefore it must be removed and never seen again. I hope you don t just stop at a punnet of strawberries  you should quit selling whisky too  and while you re banning all things Scottish-flavoured stop selling petrol as well.

There was a security guard smoking there but as it was warm I felt that my need for the shade was greater than his.  As the space was a little small my husband decided to get out of the car before I reversed in. He happened to look at the tyres as I was reversing and when I was getting out he said   omg you have to come and look at this .  I was absolutely horrified when I saw the split in the wall of the tyre; partly because it had had a health check at the dealership a couple of weeks earlier and partly because I had checked them myself earlier in the week.  So we popped into the shop for the few bits and pieces we needed and then went home very carefully because I was so concerned about the tyre.  We would have gone to the tyre man then but he is only open on Saturday mornings so we planned to take it in first thing on Monday.  When I got home I started making lunch only to be called by my husband as two police officers had appeared and were looking at my car. I went straight out to them and told them that we had just become aware of the issue and had already made plans to deal with it on Monday.  I explained about the health check and the check I had performed earlier in the week and they were satisfied I was being open and honest and went on their way.  It was clear from what they said that the security guard had phoned them.  I accept that I was responsible for driving the car when I shouldn t have but our shock and horror must have been obvious to the guard who had clearly overheard our conversation.  I would also like everyone who reads this to consider how often they check their own tyres.  Tesco told my husband  when he went in to ask if it was their policy to check the roadworthiness of all the vehicles on their car park  that the guard had been acting because of duty of care.  I think that the guard at the very least showed poor judgment in his actions and I wonder how he behaves to people who might genuinely make a mistake with their shopping.  And I also wonder why  if they are so concerned about duty of care  tesco allow their staff to pollute the car park by smoking.  If I leave my dogs in the car when it s a bit warm I leave the windows down and have to put up with the stench of cigarettes in my car on my return.

I don t know if you are aware  but when pregnant you re not allowed to eat food that has rotten spots on them...  I really hope that there is a way for your company to make the transport and storage of strawberries maybe a bit better as it is in most of the boxes I ve had this season and it s really upsetting  and even worse when it s your very bad pregnancy craving...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14117694_10210389815850536_5012842436519525886_n.jpg?oh=23e46762d554becc77a97cd0d3d7c001&oe=58E5E2F6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14117694_10210389815850536_5012842436519525886_n.jpg?oh=d74964472d91bf93b1be74cbcaaf2088&oe=58E229FB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210389815850536&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-24T21:30:31+0000	1472074231	2016-08-24 23:30:31	0	8	3	0	11	7	3	4	2	0	0	0	2	1	0	0	0

They were just taken directly from the shelves without having been previously reduced. We are your faithful customers and like many other people  we care about waste reduction and we watched Hugh s war on waste and many other documentaries and we were horrified buy this spectacle! We asked the people in charge and they explained us that this is your policy: you don t reduce some items  you just put them in a bin and give them to farms...would t be better to reduce them and try to sell them to the community? And shouldn t you consider to bake less and cut less bread in order to prevent waste? Are fighting or not this absurd waste? We look forward to hearing from you soon. #wastenot !					2016-08-24T21:11:19+0000	1472073079	2016-08-24 23:11:19	0	4	1	0	5	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Today this lovely lady took time out to speak to Theo  he normally withdraws in situations like this but today was an exception  she spoke to him about all the different kinds of fish she had and how they were prepared  we must of been at the counter for some time. So I said to Theo he could choose a fish to take home to try and so he did  her kindness didn t stop there and she showed him how she prepared the fish for us to eat!  I know for many this won t sound like much but she made such a difference to our usual difficult shopping trip and I won t home with a very happy boy! Please if you can reward this member of staff not for only her amazing customer skills but also her kindness.  Many thanks  Claire and Theo 😀🐟 Ps the fish was yummy!!! 😋	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14045780_10153668631601433_545277488511979086_n.jpg?oh=57713de6e93f8cfce2657c4f1d982a7c&oe=5919F279	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14045780_10153668631601433_545277488511979086_n.jpg?oh=386170e2047fd455a49be24a2c961d87&oe=591EB16C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153668631601433&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-24T20:58:00+0000	1472072280	2016-08-24 22:58:00	3797	210	4128	375	4713	205	147	58	803	0	3752	313	13	1	0	0	0

Was in the tesco superstore in littlehampton to day and took with me a load of plastic bags for recycling. Upon arriving at the store  it appears you are no longer interested in recycling them and I was instructed to phone the council.  I find this highly disappointing as in previous contact with you I was told you were commited to recycling and sustainability. Is this not so?					2016-08-24T19:38:46+0000	1472067526	2016-08-24 21:38:46	2	8	2	0	10	8	5	3	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

When we went to collect them they said they didn t know about the order and then changed to say they had a problem and they were being proven and would be ready in an hour and a half . We expressed that we were not happy but would return in an hour and a half. We then went to complain to customer services who said they would check what the problem was and would phone me to confirm the problem. My husband returned at the specified time to be told there was no order in the book  then they found it  and was then told they hadn t put them in the oven yet!!!! Confused??? Me too  it seems there was a catalogue of errors in the store yesterday as we had no phonecall from customer services either! We finally had our rolls which we had to then cool under fans in order to use them . Yesterday was already a stressful day without all this. I don t usually complain but I was really upset. I would like to add though in general I love shopping in your store  the staff are always friendly and helpful.

LARGE display board outside store advertising Lurpack for £2 great deal. Went to locate it advertised on shelf at over £3! Asked shelf filling assistant who said she thought the offer expired yesterday but in the circumstances approached her supervisor what could be done. Good customer service I thought. Lady in the red fleece who I presumed to be the supervisor said no that s the price on the shelf and basically intimated take it or leave it!  Paid for shopping and left store and guess what in that short time frame the sign had been removed. Not good enough Tesco customer service stinks on this occasion! Sorry no photographic evidence to support my complaint!					2016-08-24T19:33:19+0000	1472067199	2016-08-24 21:33:19	0	9	1	2	12	8	5	3	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

My daughter is allergic to dairy  egg  gluten and soya protein.  She always LOVED your GF digestive biscuits but now the recipe has been changed and it uses soya flour.  Why would you use soya flour in an allergy product - it is an extremely common allergen! It is so disappointing as there are so few packaged foods we can buy and these were great as made from oats.  Please change the recipe back!!					2016-08-24T19:30:03+0000	1472067003	2016-08-24 21:30:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We grabbed a trolley with a seat for both children. Unfortunately  due to the hot sun  all the trolleys of this type had baby seats that were burning hot. We walked into the store and the security officer on duty immediately found something cold to cool the seat down for me. He stood and cooled this down whilst chatting to the children. We were then able to shop. An excellent example of going the extra mile. So please pass on our thanks to Richard and ensure his managers are aware how grateful we were.					2016-08-24T19:20:00+0000	1472066400	2016-08-24 21:20:00	10	3	10	1	14	3	2	1	0	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

My horse lorry broke down on the forecourt in this 30+ degree heat with my horse on board. Your team members blocked the side of the forecourt and allowed me to unload my horse in safety and keep her in the shade whilst we awaited recovery  providing water to both myself and my horse.   During this time  there was an extremely rude customer effing and blinding about not being able to reach the air and water as this was near where the horse was - the staff were very polite and explained the situation to the woman the best that they could and kept my horse in a position that was safe for all parties; customers and horses.   We managed to load my horse into recovery vehicle swiftly and safety due to the quick thinking of your staff and as the situation was kept so calm and stress free  I was able to continue to my competition and come 1st and 2nd.    I could not thank them any more  they truly went above and beyond and are a real credit to your store.  Xepa  thinks so too!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14068311_10153986076334611_4962587828807934633_n.jpg?oh=a295f4620d1e60c66006b1103216b00b&oe=58ED87D8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14068311_10153986076334611_4962587828807934633_n.jpg?oh=065dda5c5775a392f6eec9e8994201ae&oe=58E153D5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153986076334611&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-24T19:12:37+0000	1472065957	2016-08-24 21:12:37	22952	619	24448	1971	27038	606	479	127	2880	0	22743	1347	132	5	0	0	0

I ve been to 3 different stores to find red polo shirts you have none and all the help I get from your staff is indifference.  I ve just been told   we only sell what we re given and that s not red... you have light blue  green  white even yellow but no red?? And then black school skirts... none of those either..... so I thought I would try on line.... delivery date for the 27th SEPTEMBER!!! Are you serious??

He brought 2 chocolate bars and 2 small drinks he paid with a £10 note  the cashier gave him change as if he had paid with £5 he asked for more change and she refused  he spoke to the manager who was very rude and didnt care his staff member had short changed my partner by £5 and proceeded to tell my partner that there was nothing he could do  my partner came out to the car and told me so then i went back in and spoke to the cashier she was so rude and told me that it wasnt her problem  I spoke to the manager and he told me that he would not check his cctv because he didnt have time for that  apprently his tills where fine so it wasnt his problem either  i said  ill take £5 of item from the shop then  he said he would call the police and report me for theft  its not theft if you have £5 of MY money. I know full well my partner gave him a £10 note because before we left our house I took £10 from my purse and left my purse at home as we were walking the dogs I knew I wouldnt need anymore than a £10 for the carpark on the beach and a drink each  I gave my partner the £10 note to go into the shop with. The staff were disgraceful and their attitude was absolutely appauling. Short changing me by £5 may seem pathetic as its only £5 but its the principle and the staff members attitudes.  Will not be going back there again and will proceed to tell people how disgusted I am with their actions and lack of customer service skills!!!					2016-08-24T14:07:43+0000	1472047663	2016-08-24 16:07:43	3	10	6	2	18	10	4	6	13	0	3	0	0	0	0	3	0

Your decision to remove a saltire from produce made or grown in Scotland is disgusting. It shows a lack of respect for the individual nations within our union. It is my opinion that as one of our leading supermarket chains you are in an ideal position to be aware of all the differences between our four member nations. While it is important to remember we are a union  it is also important to give credit where it is due.   Allowing customers to bully you into removing our flag shows you are more concerned with profits than your customers.   I sincerely hope that you see common sense and become more sensitive to the people who buy your products.					2016-08-24T14:06:47+0000	1472047607	2016-08-24 16:06:47	5	12	5	0	17	11	6	5	10	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

The escalator had stopped whilst we were upstairs due to an accident in pitsea tesco  I am extremely claustrophobic and I began to panic after staff told me I had to use the lift and there were no other options. The lovely security guard mentioned some steps  so asked around while a lot said no there was a lovely man who could see the lift wasn t an option so took me to the fire exit steps and took us that way while another lovely couple took our trolley down the lift. This man made my day and took me out of an extremely stressful situation where I was almost in tears. I hope he gets the recognition he deserves as a kind great person who looks after his customers thank you tesco :)					2016-08-24T13:19:22+0000	1472044762	2016-08-24 15:19:22	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a delivery last night to be delivered today from 10am-11pm to my apartment. It came to 11.07 I still had recieved no delivery so I called customer service they advised I would recieve a call from stretford store to confirm what has happening with my delivery. I recieved a call from Sophie at 11.37 (37 minutes after my delivery time) stating that the driver could not find my apartment- so why didn t the driver ring me and ask me where I live ???? I have had tonsillitis since last Thursday and I am on cocodamol and cannot drive due to my tablets that is the reason I ordered a delivery  now I have no food in my apartment and no way to go out and get any. Sophie from stretford tesco put her manager on the phone and he stated that he has no drivers coming to my area for the rest of the day and offered no alternative to this situation. I am now £91.00 down due to your incompetence . I am now without food. What are you going to do- bearing in mind this delivery was meant to be here between 10-11. I am not happy at all. This needs to be sorted ASAP.					2016-08-24T11:25:52+0000	1472037952	2016-08-24 13:25:52	0	3	0	0	3	2	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She d only given birth 11 months ago and still isn t totally comfortable in wearing what she would before she became pregnant.   This is absolutely disgusting behaviour by 2 fellow females who made her feel really uncomfortable whilst in store which has now led to her feeling uncomfortable and self conscious about her choice of clothes going forward!  I really hope something is done about this otherwise I ll be heading into store to address the issue myself!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14095749_10153655762226481_4264568253734030296_n.jpg?oh=4f6a950c26346afd3a0df7b09f579b19&oe=58E44717	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14095749_10153655762226481_4264568253734030296_n.jpg?oh=f1a8cde4102ead6d543731877bc75d69&oe=58EA9F1A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153655762226481&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-24T11:06:42+0000	1472036802	2016-08-24 13:06:42	26	30	35	32	97	28	18	10	59	0	26	0	2	0	1	6	0

Packing to go to airport and find security tags still on garments. What is the actual point in having them on if it s so easy to get out the shop with them? It s only cost me an hour out of my day and petrol to go and have one removed along with the stress of being late for my flight. A few of my friends have had the same dilemma so it s about time you re-train your checkout operators to look for these when clothes are purchased!😡					2016-08-24T10:45:21+0000	1472035521	2016-08-24 12:45:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In my original order I ordered 400g of loose cooked counter ham  as I am having friends and their children over today and am providing a delicious lunch of ham sandwiches  crisps and other party/picnic type foods!  Imagine my brief disappointment when the delivery driver informs me that this item  was the one that was substituted. When we both looked though we noted that it had been replaced for finest  loose  cooked ham  so to us both that looked an acceptable substitute.  After the driver left and shopping was being put away I noticed that the said ham was in fact in a plastic package  not loose as said on receipt and there is only 125g costing £2.50! Now    as a mother of 18 yrs I am very good at making food  spread out  in the occasion of unexpected people arriving for dinner  but I feel that even in the style of Jesus during the feeding of the 5000  I would struggle to make 125g of ham stretch to the equivalence of 400g - perhaps I could put a small piece in the corner of each sandwich so it  looks  as though it s packed with delicious ham? I telephoned customer services and I was offered a refund of my £2.50  for which I am grateful  but this does now mean that I have to get my children ready and go out and drive to my local  nearest (competitor) supermarket and purchase more sliced delicatessen products.  This one item seems to be an issue for the pickers at your Stafford store as it is always the one I have problems with - maybe they have had a bad experience with Teddy Bears and now have an aversion to  picnic  style food  I don t know? Still  I suppose the product received today was better than the day I received raw chicken breast instead of cooked sliced chicken - DIY deli chicken perhaps  could be your next marketing drive(?).  Now I must dash as the good people at JS Sainsbury s are waiting for me with their sharpened meat slicer and their plastic gloves. I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

You pay for a product  you expect a product. Paid for a tumble drier  money came out straight away  only to then be messed about with delivery. Had to take TWO separate days off to wait for delivery of my tumble drier only for it to then be damaged to the extent that it does not work and tescos unwilling to do very much about it. NEVER buying anything from tescos again.

She is 74yrs young and was doing some shopping for a neighbour. John recognised her kindness and presented her with a bunch of flowers on him! Mum was really grateful and John made her day. When she got home she took the flowers round to a neighbour  not because she was ungrateful but because John had brightened her day and she wanted to brighten somebody else s!

I had major surgery last year and live on a restricted diet of mainly special shakes and special k maple and pecan porridge pots which I purchased from your Tesco extra in Balby though have travelled 60 miles in the past to try and get some when Balby  Doncaster didn t have any. I buy in excess of 60 pots per week and with my other shopping spend between £150 and £200 a week in your store. I went to buy my porridge last week and found that there was none (this has happened before hence my trips as far as Leeds) anyway I spoke to the stock manager who was lovely but who advised that due to it being removed from sales. She explained that they had no control over it as it had come from head office. It isn t a slow seller which she confirmed as I buy everything that you have in store. The lady has said she will try to reorder it in in 4 weeks time once the system has been unlocked but by then I will have gone 3 weeks no food!! I went to have a look yesterday at the new cereal line implemented to replace the special k ones and they are all Tesco own brand  none of them nice  none of them meeting the restricted sugar allowance I have. Would have expected a bit of loyalty as a customer of Tesco and given what I spend in your store. #asda #morrisons #ocado all loyal to their customers					2016-08-24T07:06:28+0000	1472022388	2016-08-24 09:06:28	2	9	2	0	11	9	3	6	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will then take my bill into Tesco Inverurie and show it to the Duty Mgr so they can see just how much custom they are losing in me alone. I have already emailed Tesco Customer Service to advise them of this. I suggest ANYONE can do this - there is no need to be confrontational or rude about it....just save your alternate choice grocery bill  head for Tesco afterwards  speak to the Duty Mgr & continue to do this every time you shop until they get the message. If enough people ALL OVER the UK do this it will get our point across in spades that Tesco shoppers are NOT amused and their bowing to what amounts to anti-Scotland racism will cost them millions.

My mother works for your store and has done so for 15 years now and we have been loyal shoppers with you even though people keep telling us Aldi is cheaper and just as good quality. After this revelation I won t be continuing my loyalty with your brand. I think it s disgusting that customers have complained about this in the first place but for you to actually act on it when you have already been in the news recently for changing hours of stores  letting people go from their jobs and actually closing down some stores is even more disgusting. If you have the funds to start repackaging unnecessarily then surely you have them to keep 24 hour stores 24 hours!

Can you tell me why you have done this? I think it should be important to Tesco s to inform customers where their food is coming from. I love Scottish strawberries and when they are in season I buy them  but if I were to see a Union Jack I would think English. As the Saltire is the flag of Scotland. As a Scot passionate to promote my country s good food  I find this action by Tesco s purely as a political move. Unless I am told differently.

Pic taken in Tesco Danestone  Aberdeen. How many complaints did you get from Scottish customers?  These were on sale for a long time  even after that team was out. Get a bloody back bone for god sake. It was clear no one was buying those Mars bars due to the volume left and price. If folk don t want to buy food with flags on it they can choose to buy something else can t they? What s next? Doing away with the foreign food section because someone made a complaint? So folks out there  lets all complain from now on if Tesco display any flag of any nation on a product.

Fortunately  I was able to show the police officer the email containing the policy  confirming that the car was insured  and was allowed to go on my way  with a car full of kids crying hysterically because they thought mummy was being arrested. This was the first time in 30 years of driving that I had experienced this and I have to admit I was scared. Anyway  fast forward to today  when I return home from my holiday to a letter from the Motor Insurance Bureau  informing me that the  record of insurance for my motor vehicle...does not appear on their database . I m horrified. There has clearly been an oversight on your part and I would be very grateful if you could rectify this as soon as possible. Thank you.					2016-08-23T22:08:36+0000	1471990116	2016-08-24 00:08:36	1	11	1	0	12	11	11	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have shopped in your local store since it first opened in my community but I feel I get a better deal from Aldi just around the corner from Tesco. You see my problem does not imply that your staff are below par but instead your morals. Aldi are not afraid to show the fact that they sell Scottish products by proudly displaying the flag of said Scottish products. Does this mean that you will remove the Polish  Italian and Chinese products from your store because obviously I am deeply offended that I can easily find FOREIGN products by their labels/flags/language but I have to read labels and spend more time searching the country of origin before I am fully satisfied that I am eating products from LOCALLY owned farms in my LOCAL community in SCOTLAND. Now if you feel that the flag of Scotland is offending your customers in SCOTLAND then surely when you had the BRAZIL flags all over your store the ARGENTINIANS  MEXICANS  URUGUAYANS  and the like of all other SOUTH AMERICAN countries also took offence  it was RIO 2016 and NOT Brazil 2016. The same as it was LONDON 2012 and NOT England 2012.					2016-08-23T21:36:55+0000	1471988215	2016-08-23 23:36:55	8	6	8	2	16	6	6	0	7	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve purchased full cream blue top milk from your express store in Cwmbran for my 1 year old son to drink. As you can see by the photo the used by date doesn t run out until this Friday. when warming this milk up for my son as a daily routine the milk curdles within seconds of me heating it up!!!!  As I do not drive and my local shop is more than 15minute walk away and due to this time of night he will have to go without. I will never rely on tescos products again because I find this disgusting and in future will purchase this product else where!!!!!!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14055005_1052842294771543_5843007171178852622_n.jpg?oh=20aa5b1b4a3fbe538e2f6a79b07369ba&oe=591FE68F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14055005_1052842294771543_5843007171178852622_n.jpg?oh=9e39b4d662d6a5092765a0bf87533459&oe=58E93A9A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1052842294771543&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-23T21:21:28+0000	1471987288	2016-08-23 23:21:28	2	2	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

But what I saw tonight shocked me so much that I will not be buying any more from yourselves or shop at your store s anymore. How the the he ll can you justify to put the price up by nearly 50%...19p to be exact that is 6p short of 50%....people might say it s only 19p but if you put everything up nearly 50% you won t have many customers if any. On your Tesco plc site it says that you are going to supply excess food to charities well it looks like they might end up with more food than they can cope with.					2016-08-23T20:49:30+0000	1471985370	2016-08-23 22:49:30	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She was very upset and agitated when I saw her talking to  Sue  and the retail park security officer. So as a familiar face to help I stopped and tried to calm my neighbour and see if I  an help at all. Sue explained what had happened and that she had in fact been trying to help my neighbour for just over an hour. After a further hour and a phone call to a few other neighbours who came to help Thank goodness the key was sorted and home she rode. I always believe too many people stop to complain but not so many stop to offer praise. So I wanted to Thank Sue for her patience and understanding as she went far beyond any job description to help.					2016-08-23T20:05:54+0000	1471982754	2016-08-23 22:05:54	11	3	11	0	14	3	2	1	1	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had Hagen daz twice and Ben and jerry s twice which is what I ve just paid for.  The items are always so frosty they need to wipe it off before scanning  and I don t know if it s the freezers there or storage or transport but it s like they ve been defrosted then re frozen  the ice cream isn t creamy it s like ice crystals and the cookie dough tastes horrid.

I returned home after a long day on my feet at work  so tired that I was unable to acquire my inner Gordon Ramsey and managed to summon the strength to raise my arm high enough to open my kitchen cupboard to see what culinary delights appeared before me. And there it was  like a gift from the gods - the immortal can of spaghetti hoops and sausages 🙊🙊 BUT THEN the unthinkable happened after a struggle to undo the ring pull  a struggle similar to that of the late Steve Irwin wrestling a saltwater Croc   can you imagine my shock and horror that there were no sausages in my can of spaghetti hoops. Yes I can still use my fork to hook up the spaghetti hoops but that effort requires energy  energy comes from food  no sausages = lack of food = lack of energy. My shock has now given way into disappointment  I even messaged my girlfriend to see if she was playing some kind of cruel trick on me. She was not. I felt so strongly about this matter that I feel as though I should contact you so that this hurtful event doesn t occur to anyone else. Yours sausage - less   Aaron 😢	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14068260_10210598184337090_3504852190273020380_n.jpg?oh=974cb5204af7e9061b4f7ac31c096940&oe=5922600A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14068260_10210598184337090_3504852190273020380_n.jpg?oh=a012d6ffa18c5659fe77c09c7865f60d&oe=59237F07	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210598184337090&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-23T19:25:11+0000	1471980311	2016-08-23 21:25:11	10	4	12	0	16	4	3	1	0	0	10	0	0	0	2	0	0

Due to a small group of English people complaining about the saltire being on produce from Scotland.  You changed it to the Union Jack.    Are we now to assume that you are also changing English produce to the same flag.  Will Red Leicester cheese now no longer have the Saint George??  By bowing too this sort of nonsense just causes more divide between the two countries.  Please stop this stupidity and return the saltire as it is just a mark to show which country is was made/produced.  Yours  Very annoyed at your lack of thought Former customer.  P.s.  Yes I know I am one person but this topic has a wide audience on social media.  The people are many..  To the original complainers  shame on you. You have done your country a disservice and showed just how small minded and un evolved you are.					2016-08-23T19:16:39+0000	1471979799	2016-08-23 21:16:39	11	8	13	0	21	8	2	6	7	0	11	2	0	0	0	0	0

An elderly lady at one of the checkouts was struggling with loading her shopping from her trolley onto the checkout. The cashier at the checkout was very patient with her and trying his best to offer advice from his position. After a few minutes a lady wearing tesco pharmacy uniform came over (she had obviously just finished work and was getting some shopping before returning home) and started to help the elderly lady.

I visit the store once a week for my shopping (and everyday in between for something I forgot) so i know a few staff members by face and name. Today whilst shopping with my three year old (a now painless task thanks to the free fruit initiative). I get to the till and he decided to go behind a sign and promptly fell and hurt his leg! Cue screaming child!!The store manager (Matt) could see (and hear) the commotion and came over swiftly and began unpacking my shopping onto the conveyer   whilst the checkout assistant (Debbie) was talking to my son about helping to put the shopping through and distracted him from wailing!! The store manager and another member of staff (Susan ) then asked if I needed help packing my shopping too!! I feel the staff at the store are always really helpful and friendly and deserve a mention (and maybe some personal recognition from head office) Especially since two weeks ago the same child was upset again at the till and Lillian the checkout assistant was again marvellous at helping and distracting!!  Great work from them all!!					2016-08-23T18:57:18+0000	1471978638	2016-08-23 20:57:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Surely giving recognition of origin of the food stuffs grown in these islands is a positive attitude. So why this ridiculous change of attitude?  Scottish soft fruits from Tayside and Moray areas have always been held in HIGH regard by people in England  particularly chefs of famous and other class of restaurants/hotels. Also Scotch beef   lamb and venison along with our fish such as salmon  trout and of course  our shellfish  from prawns  lobster  crabs  langustine  oysters  mussels  cockles etc...So WHY would TESCO be persuaded by some Xenophic people ....That is the sad reality of the matter..!					2016-08-23T18:51:07+0000	1471978267	2016-08-23 20:51:07	18	1	19	0	20	1	1	0	2	0	18	1	0	0	0	0	0

Really great staff  thanks so much to him and the ladies at customer service.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14067721_10153700259302213_5678845721813145225_n.jpg?oh=090ea80b04d83dcdefecbebfb0861603&oe=5922321D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14067721_10153700259302213_5678845721813145225_n.jpg?oh=8ddd7865d8a67c042d783833afd27d36&oe=5921E710	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153700259302213&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-23T18:49:43+0000	1471978183	2016-08-23 20:49:43	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just been on the Direct website  looking to order a couple of PS4 games. One of these comes up with free standard delivery  the other (Deus Ex: Mankind Divided) comes up with a standard delivery fee of £7.95 and no option for Click & Collect. Both items are over £30.  The £7.95 delivery fee seems awfully high for something smaller than a standard DVD case. What exactly is the policy around delivery fees for entertainment goods ordered via Direct and is there anything you can do regarding this particular item  please?

Is there a logical explanation? And where will this denial of Scotlands existence stop. You are undermining our identity and caving in to an anti Scottish mentality being promulgated in the media south of the border. If goods are produced here then identify them as such. I think I am not alone in feeling that this is a degrading insult to Scotland. I will not be shopping with you again.					2016-08-23T17:35:58+0000	1471973758	2016-08-23 19:35:58	13	7	13	0	20	7	2	5	5	0	13	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is an alive catterpillar(in case you cannot see). I have lost all faith in Tescos. The back of the packaging says you have strict policies on this type of thing- how did this get through?!  I m glad it was not eaten as this could have made me very ill.  Returning to customer services and I will be expecting a thorough investigation. Sincerely  A very annoyed and disgusted former customer.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/s130x130/13907020_10153609800887820_2634995789509813299_n.jpg?oh=0b318b139853beee2bed78cbf4dd9374&oe=58DFDA83	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q86/s720x720/13907020_10153609800887820_2634995789509813299_n.jpg?oh=6f291393b7a91efbecdc4a4fcdba8ca2&oe=58E5EA5E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153609800887820&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-23T17:31:44+0000	1471973504	2016-08-23 19:31:44	1	8	2	0	10	8	1	7	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

I have found out the most of the cameras on the bletchley extra store are not recorded because your staff told me. My Bike was vandalized in your bike rack outside the main entrance last night between 6pm and half past. I asked to look at the CCTV today to be told the camera aimed at the bike rack is not recorded!!!! I will refrain from using the words i want to use but I put my bike there thinking it was safe with a camera pointed at it.  I use that store normally twice a week and the local store on buckingham road 2-3 times a week minimum for my daily stuff. I put my trust in you when i mistakenly thought your cctv was looking after me and my bike  keeping us safe. You betrayed that trust and now its going to cost my £50 to replace the tires and inner tubes that were slashed.To add insult to it all i was going to buy the replacements from you online because i thought you are kind enough to look after your customers and their bikes. Im glad i didnt know the tire size lunchtime now.  I will not be using any of your stores from now on. I will use asda for my main shop and the co-op for my daily stuff. So disappointed after the nice comments i put on my post yesterday about the incident.					2016-08-23T17:25:59+0000	1471973159	2016-08-23 19:25:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I went to do my shop with a very grumpy 1 year old. By the time I had done my shopping and got to the tills he was beyond grumpy and was starting to get upset.  All the open tills has customers using them  Di very kindly opened a till for me so I did not have to wait. Not only that she unloaded my trolley for me  then scanned it all and packed it all for me while I entertained my little boy.   Shopping with a toddler is hard enough is but shopping with a grumpy one can be a nightmare.  So a very big thanks to Di who helped  if you hadn t helped I don t know how I would have coped!					2016-08-23T17:23:26+0000	1471973006	2016-08-23 19:23:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Clearly they are not professional painters as professional painters are men who have learnt their trade. Though I am sure they are doing their best a lot of paint is going on the floor which doesn t look good. Also  curiously  they are painting perfectly good stainless steel bollards with metallic  paint. ( a bizarre thing to do to stainless steel) Now I realise Tesco s profits are in the doldrums  but doesn t using untrained people to do what should be done by a tradesman portray a rather strange amateurish image to customers? I especially liked the manager who had taped Tesco carrier bags over his shoes to protect them from rogue paint very funny. Of course the Store will remain anonymous.					2016-08-23T16:37:32+0000	1471970252	2016-08-23 18:37:32	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I merrily requested another that I could leave at home and forget on my next shopping trip.  Imagine my horror  when I was told that you don t do a bag for life any more  once the dizziness had passed  I asked why - was told it s a euro thing or too many people were exchanging them.  I don t believe it s a new edict from Brussels as punishment for us voting to leave the EU  I m sure my bag for life mountain could support the whole country for a few years.  As for people changing them - I may still be a bit woozy from shock - but wasn t that the point?  Come on tesco - fess up? Do you still have a bag for life and if not - why?					2016-08-23T16:32:41+0000	1471969961	2016-08-23 18:32:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What next  no Scottish beef or lamb? Scottish salmon? Insist tartan is removed from any packaging of shortbread? I like to eat local produce. I prefer the taste of soft fruit grown in Angus and Perthshire. Just as I enjoy cherries grown in Kent.

Well  here s a complaint from Scotland.   Scottish  is a brand.  Will you now insist on  British  whisky or  British  salmon or whatever?  I happen to be English but a long-time Scottish resident and I feel this is absolutely disgraceful.  So  for the record  I will no longer buy any of your products that sport the Union flag.  Please keep nasty British nationalism out of our shopping.					2016-08-23T15:50:50+0000	1471967450	2016-08-23 17:50:50	35	15	35	3	53	15	8	7	18	0	34	0	0	0	0	0	0

I delayed by taking a walk with my small person  we visited the park and went to a baby group. However  I could delay no longer. The reality of the one slice of bread and no milk was real. We trudged round Tesco  aforementioned small person strapped into the child seat of the trolley. All was fine... Until we got to Aisle 18. A melt down was brewing. The child wanted out. Desperate to avoid what every parent fears the most - a super market tantrum - I dutifully lifted Small from the trolley. Let me tell you that lugging your 11 month old  who weighs over 30lb  whilst tying to steer a trolley is no mean feat. I kept trying to put him back in the trolley  but he was having none of it. With a shopping list as long as my arm  I plodded on. I had a sweat on at this point  ready to abandon the trolley. Just how essential is toilet roll anyway?   That is until we reached what I can only describe as a beacon of light: a tray of fruit with the heading  Free Fruit For Children - Help Yourself!  Above it. Said child loves fruit  as in really really loves fruit. Thanks to the free satsuma  I managed to get my small person into the trolley seat and complete my shop with no further meltdowns.   Now  if only you could provide a shot of whiskey for the parents as well as fruit for the children  I would really enjoy the weekly shop!					2016-08-23T15:45:01+0000	1471967101	2016-08-23 17:45:01	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ate a few  (unfortunately as didn t have my reading specs on at the time). 2 days later  took them out the fridge  wondered what a little white spec was  then realised it was moving. Put specs on. Each rasberry had tiny maggots. Guessing the eggs were laid and and then when they came out of cold storage to go on the shelf  started to hatch. NEVER again will I buy them.

Finally after following her around with the printer ink she got the message and decided to take the security tag off with a horrific look on her face like i had just took her last lollypop. Next time i will pay for my items and then set the security alarms off maybe this will get the tags removed with less fuss! Again tesco please apologise to your employee so rudley offended yesterday  and please in regards of every little helps i do hope she has had a better evening since i left the store. Best wishes from one overly satisfied customer (NOT)!!!!!......					2016-08-23T14:51:39+0000	1471963899	2016-08-23 16:51:39	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a mobile phone in feb this year and as we all know when we purchase a phone the info we must provide could fill an MI5 folder The charger stopped working so I took it back with the box and all it contained and they would not change it because I could not find the receipt. I pointed out that all the purchase info was still on the box including perhaps the colour of my eyes  The assistant still would not budge. I also pointed out that the trolley I had with me contained £99 plus of groceries that I had just purchased. Made no difference he still insisted that I pay for the charger. Needless to say they will not be seeing me again					2016-08-23T14:17:25+0000	1471961845	2016-08-23 16:17:25	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

If so  that s shocking. You should be celebrating and promoting local suppliers and products. I for one try to always buy local produce  wherever I am. To make this more difficult for consumers based on irrational complaints is yet another smack in the face from Tesco. 	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAElgwMgij2UVnR&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmetrouk2.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fad216821072tesco-has-remove.jpg%3Fw%3D620%26h%3D827%26crop%3D1&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQBdLfZCrbE4hOwd	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCO023pVVLiHBsk&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmetrouk2.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fad216821072tesco-has-remove.jpg%3Fw%3D620%26h%3D827%26crop%3D1&_nc_hash=AQC1fVmSsIXPNuxz	http://metro.co.uk/2016/08/23/tesco-removes-scottish-flag-from-fruit-because-of-english-complaints-6085235/	metro.co.uk	2016-08-23T14:15:09+0000	1471961709	2016-08-23 16:15:09	13	17	16	0	33	15	2	13	25	0	13	0	0	1	0	2	0

I just would just like to say thank you to whoever felt the need to send us this non working game that had already been sent back to you as a faulty game. Which surely should of been obvious to the person that packed it with it being bright yellow!!  My 7 year old son has waited over a week for this game to turn up  and it was received as a non working game.  He has done nothing but sob this morning thanks to your incompetence!! Not only that when we rang your company we were told someone would collect the game and drop off a new one within 3 days  we have now been told  this is not true and it will be posted tomorrow so my son has now got to wait over a week again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14064226_292541741124046_898784755887015277_n.jpg?oh=6d34fda1070e589ca31613b7cac67989&oe=58E663A6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14064226_292541741124046_898784755887015277_n.jpg?oh=50dfcba4eb121e9dc414daed8b46c8e7&oe=58E0A551	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=292541741124046&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-23T14:04:34+0000	1471961074	2016-08-23 16:04:34	0	9	0	0	9	9	2	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tescos remedy for this seems to be to pander to their whims and instead impose a Union flag on all of us.   The saltire not only serves to instantly give an instant visual indication of origin  but also a brand image of quality assurance along the lines of Scotch Whisky  Scotch Beef  Scottish Salmon etc...    For Tesco to ditch this in favour of imposing the Union flag on us makes a total mockery of claimed pride in Scottish produce.  Why not add a St Georges cross to English based produce to satisfy their sudden new found pride. I wouldn t find that in sny way offensive at all. The packaging mechanism clearly exists already.   No matter  in response to this ill thought out decision  I ve made mine  and my fruit and veg will now be sourced from outlets that aren t scared to promote the saltire flag such as Morrisons  Aldi  Lidl  etc...					2016-08-23T13:48:54+0000	1471960134	2016-08-23 15:48:54	4	7	4	0	11	6	6	0	10	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

In mid May 2016 I popped upstairs and came across a lovely pair of gold coloured flip flops. Brilliant! I thought they looked nice  are comfy and into my trolley they went.   Unfortunately these said flip flops have since decided that they are going to do everything in their power to try and kill me!  About 2 and a half weeks after purchase  while wearing said flips flops  I fell and fractured my right ankle! I then spent one month with crutches and a medical boot.   Thinking it was a one off and the school holidays  trips to the beach made it impossible not to wear the killer  flip flops .   All has been fine up until last night. While wearing the  flip flops  they struck again and this time they targeted my other ankle!!!  Another trip to A&E and only 2 months since my last trip they have confirmed that I have now fractured my LEFT ANKLE!!!!  I am once again in a medical boot and on crutches  my poor kids are stuck at home with a poorly mummy. And I am left with these killer flip flops.

At this point I was getting flustered and baby was screaming  a lovely member of staff named Clair (I think on her badge it said her job was to with customer experience) came over and offered me help. I told her the problem and she took the bottle off me and helped me with the trolley into a back staff room  provided me with cold water to cool the bottle and left me to feed her :) she was lovely!

Waited 15m to collect a parcel from Tesco direct. The staff told me that there is no-one allocated to the desk today so had to wait for a manger. Given I only have 30m for lunch & it takes 5m to get to Tesco & back -guess how long I had to eat anything !😡😡😡😡😡					2016-08-23T11:58:18+0000	1471953498	2016-08-23 13:58:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I chose  Tesco finest smooth orange juice  to find that it was full of juicy bits; and infact not smooth at all. I was extremely disappointed. As I do not like this drink. It must of had the wrong label on it  as it was advertised as  smooth .  I am currently feeling gullible  violated  and extremely thirsty. I tried to consume  awful orange liquid but to be perfectly honest 250 ML of this vile substance is just too much for anybody.  I suppose I will never get to the bottom of this mystery. I m thinking that perhaps the bottle- still sat lonely on the shelf of the fridge in Tescos  labelled  with juicy bits  is I fact the smooth drink I wish I was drinking now. Heart broken! Ooooooooooh I can almost taste it.   As I have been inconvenienced so greatly (let s please remember I am now having to stop again during my long journey- to purchase an additional citrus beverage AT SERVICE STATION PRICES) I think I am now due some serious compensation  don t you? Please let me know what you think is reasonable in the form of compensation? I have always been rather partial to a Clubcard voucher or two.   Many thanks for your time and understanding in this sad and frustrating matter.

Picked up a lovely jumper ( there were a few on hangers ) took it the till .. Nice lady Elaine served me but said no code was coming up so I paid for my shopping and someone took me to customer service desk .... But hey ho .. Couldn t find a code so said you can t buy it and we will have to take the rest off the rack ??? I said there is a price on it can you just not ring it through ? ... No and shrugged shoulders ! I mean do they want my business or not ? Whatever happened to CUSTOMER SERVICE ?					2016-08-23T09:20:23+0000	1471944023	2016-08-23 11:20:23	5	15	6	2	23	15	12	3	10	0	5	0	1	0	0	0	0

I went into my local tesco to buy it  but it s not on the shelves. I go to the electrical department and ask if they can order it in for me  and they can...but it will cost an extra £2.00 because it s click and collect. I m not clicking and collecting I m standing at the desk asking for an item to be ordered in for me. Why should I pay an extra 10% on top of the price because it s not on the shelf of the tesco I m in! This is just not right. A Ms Forbes has already emailed me a standard answer about click and collect. The £2.00 charge for items under £30.00 is already a really bad idea  but this is a rip off!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14089104_1772638879687731_2552242844634883611_n.jpg?oh=0fbbabad7d0c976b65e6f57e2a9c40d7&oe=58EE8B48	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14089104_1772638879687731_2552242844634883611_n.jpg?oh=5b77376f6d168c58e832fcabfe637d5b&oe=591C7934	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1772638879687731&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-23T09:19:27+0000	1471943967	2016-08-23 11:19:27	2	4	2	1	7	4	4	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

In my excitement to treat myself to a sneaky chocolate bar  whilst I am meant to be dieting  I swiftly shovelled the chocolate into my mouth without considering the need to check the date. The disappointment is increased by the thought that I broke my diet for a chocolate bar that may not be up to the standard of a chocolate bar in its prime.

The delivery person tells you about any short dates  in my case 4 items. But when I checked later there were other items that were even shorter  like the next day! that were not mentioned or listed at the top of the delivery sheet. In total there was 8 items I had to report.  Is it Tesco policy in Weston Super Mare to palm short shelf life items off on home delivery customers?!					2016-08-23T07:35:47+0000	1471937747	2016-08-23 09:35:47	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This was ordered in advance of our sons 7th birthday for the 7th August and all the pieces are still not there. We are clearly gutted over this as this has raised excitement with our son only to be devastated when boxes were opened and parts missing. He had planned a trampoline party which obviously can not happen. As he is back to school next week it is probable that this won t happen now. Can you explain this outcome to a little 7year boy?					2016-08-22T22:26:28+0000	1471904788	2016-08-23 00:26:28	1	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

They have both not worked for some time now not that is not to much of an issue as she just likes to sit and drive them anyway tonight she went to get in one and I had to stop her as it had been broken into and money taken but with doing so there is a big piece if metal sticking out just where the children put their legs not sure how long it has been like this but I do feel she was very lucky I saw it as it could have cut her quite badly. I reported it to a staff member but they were not really worried I m worried for other children that might just jump in not looking.

It s a very remote area where the closest Tesco store is in ullapool  some 50 miles away. This is a small store so for a substantial shop we need to travel to Dingwall or inverness which is 100 miles away. The travelling and time spent shopping can take up to a whole day away. I have 3 small children who are 4 and under so this is never a fun outing for any of us. The village were delighted when your Wick store offered us a click and collect service last year. They come daily to our local hotel and we collect it from the van. They also did this in the village of Durness which is about 18 miles from here  although this was 3 or 4 days a week i believe. The service was highly used with the van full of orders every time I collected mine  2 vans having to deliver somedays are there were too many for the one van. Often the next day slot would be full. I was collecting 2 orders a week.  Sadly the store have now stopped coming to Durness altogether. Their residents must travel down to kinlochbervie to collect which I know many still do. Over the last few weeks however it has been very difficult to get slots and it s often 3-4 days before anything is available. It is currently Monday night and I have attached screen shots of the book a slot options. Nothing is available until SATURDAY!! As a mother with 3 small children this is too long to wait between shops and I have found myself having to travel away again all day  purely for groceries. A day I could have spent doing activities with my children but instead they are stuck in car seats for most of the day. I would also add I have chosen to shop in Asda  Morrisons and aldi on these days. Your loss is their gain!!  We understand the Wick store used to allocate 15 orders for each day but this has since been cut to 10 and now 8. There are over 8 houses on my street alone who use this service. We can t understand why it has been cut so drastically and we feel very let down by Tesco. This has become a vital service to homes and many businesses in Kinlochbervie and surrounding villages.   I would like Tesco to explain WHY this service has been cut and what action has or will be taken by the store to improve it?   Thank you	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14068116_10154495199533408_1801565787393613720_n.jpg?oh=52e50400a5e5deabd92837f1675f7c60&oe=58DC1274	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14068116_10154495199533408_1801565787393613720_n.jpg?oh=9ae16253bf2cab5ba473485014f88982&oe=58ED8279	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154495199533408&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-22T20:16:00+0000	1471896960	2016-08-22 22:16:00	46	45	54	25	124	42	20	22	29	0	45	0	0	0	0	8	0

I was absolutely astonished with the service received in the Warton Express branch this evening!  I went there to get a freshly baked baguette and there was none left  after approaching a member of staff called Rick  he has offered to bake me one if I don t mind waiting 20 minutes or so!! How amazing is that??;)   I work for Tesco myself  and know how much effort we all put into delivering the best for our customers. This has exceeded any of my expectations from my local store!

My delivery was due between 6pm & 7pm but at 6.30pm I received a text to say that  the driver was delayed due to traffic and therefore my time had changed to between 6.55 & 7.25pm which was fine.. Very informative. At 6.50pm my delivery arrived and the driver who s name was Alex  couldn t of been jollier if he tried. He asked how I was  if I had had a good day and asked if I d had tesco delivery before in which I said no. He also apologised for the delay. He went through everything on the receipt list with me  explained each section and showed me the substitute that I had received. He then helped to unload the shopping from the crates and asked if I d like a hand taking it to the kitchen as some bags were extremely heavy - but I managed myself.  He then showed me the phone number and said any problems please call this and mention my name as the driver.  SO Alex  whoever you are and wherever you may be.. Thank you for making my evening that bit brighter. And well done tesco for hiring an absolute diamond and for excellent service. 👍🏻					2016-08-22T19:44:44+0000	1471895084	2016-08-22 21:44:44	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Through no fault of the staff there  this arrangement stopped and one of the staff  Kerry  said she would call me if they were able to start it up again. Today  Kerry called to apologise that she had  as yet  been unable to get the arrangement restarted and would like to give me some of the goods I normally receive as a good will gesture  and also a gift voucher. As I m not feeling too good at the moment  my wife told Kelly that I couldn t come and pick it up but she  my wife  would happily collect tomorrow. At the end of her shift Kerry and one of her co-workers delivered said goods to our house along with a get-well-soon card from all the staff at Tesco Harft Place. Talk about  Above and beyond . I can t praise the staff at this store enough.					2016-08-22T19:41:55+0000	1471894915	2016-08-22 21:41:55	7	3	7	1	11	3	1	2	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Must say I didn t like your improved beef lasagne 😡😷 Tesco you owe me £1.50‼️	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14089187_10157345772295026_6667633377362916698_n.jpg?oh=dac012ef41f534d2d66bdd18892ef880&oe=58EFB7B4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14089187_10157345772295026_6667633377362916698_n.jpg?oh=3daec5f7c8178c2e7dad9860fc83b9f8&oe=58EEA8B9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157345772295026&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-22T19:25:00+0000	1471893900	2016-08-22 21:25:00	0	12	2	0	14	12	3	9	8	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

While shopping he accidently dropped a pot of hair gel on his big toe drawing blood. As you can imagine he was not happy and screamed the shop down  the staff mentioned could not do enough for us to keep him calm and attend to his toe. People are quick to complain about a slightly poor service but never compliment enough when it s due  so for fantastic customer service we thank you Heather  Wam and Chloe at Crosspoint Tescos in Coventry.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14068052_10155229976058986_8468837423364050647_n.jpg?oh=00377c1ad63b5d003aa0121450dc7563&oe=58DFC684	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14068052_10155229976058986_8468837423364050647_n.jpg?oh=93b82a03402efd154b7e4822131f831c&oe=58EC8589	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155229976058986&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-22T19:18:06+0000	1471893486	2016-08-22 21:18:06	12	3	12	2	17	3	1	2	1	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0

Someone goes into the back of you whilst your sat at a red traffic light... Your car gets smashed and taken in for repairs... TESCO send your details to ENTERPRISE to get a hire car... You rent a car from enterprise as they instruct you details have been passed from your insurance company and they will claim the fee s back from the 3rd party as you were not in fault... 8 months later    MTA SOLICITORS send you a letter to advise you have to go to court and they have a barrister to represent you  (who you have not Instructed to) due to claiming for a courtesy car???? REALLY? Is this real? Are people able to do this??? I would never of had a courtesy car IF my details were not passed my MY insurance company to ENTERPRISE. The courtesy car was offered  i work  I have a child and I live in the sticks!! If I didn t need a car i wouldn t have a car in the first place. Does anyone no where I stand with this headache/ or who I can report this to?? MTA solicitors call me all the time asking all sorts of questions   asking for my personal financial details including bank statements   sending letters to me causing unnecessary stress. I assumed this would be part of having insurance when someone crashes into you/careless drivers on the road? #tescoinsurethebox #enterprise #MTAsolicitors					2016-08-22T19:05:38+0000	1471892738	2016-08-22 21:05:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This would encourage those of your customers who belong to the half million cohort of the UK population who are minded not to use any product containing any substances derived from slaughtered or living animals (for sound ethical  health and environmental reasons) to go ahead and buy things off your shelves. For example  I have frequently felt unable to commit to choosing wine from Tesco because of this.					2016-08-22T18:14:11+0000	1471889651	2016-08-22 20:14:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We also found Colin the Caterpillar SNR in there who was either hibernating or on the verge of death. My fiancée Rachael Maria Cork tried to administer CPR to him on our kitchen bench as she works in a Hospital but unfortunately I don t think Colin the Caterpillar SNR has pulled through. I was going to attach a photo of Colin the Caterpillar SNR but I wanted to wait till his next of kin was informed before releasing a photo of the deceased. I would greatly appreciate it if you could contact me to discuss the funeral of Colin the Caterpillar SNR  his son seems very upset residing in our Broccoli.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14063921_10153853271209607_8502273538834304246_n.jpg?oh=3e8f74c364652b9fe93428103fce3dd8&oe=591987F7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14063921_10153853271209607_8502273538834304246_n.jpg?oh=9306452251748b1abd375d9c80ce4081&oe=58DE03FA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153853271209607&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-22T18:07:15+0000	1471889235	2016-08-22 20:07:15	35	13	45	2	60	12	6	6	11	0	34	0	1	9	0	0	0

Today I went shopping in this store with my 3 year old daughter. On the way round my daughter managed to lose her little mouse teddy from the story Gruffalo named  Mousey .   On asking your staff if anyone had handed him in  they contacted customer services  but no one had. A staff member Becky & one of the security staff began a sweep of all store aisles to look for Mousey  but we couldn t find him.   Another member of staff mentioned they had seen a little boy with his dad or grandad go through the checkouts not so long ago with  Mousey . My little girl was terribly upset as she takes Mousey to bed at night with her.   Becky showed great empathy & compassion & comforted my little girl by fetching her something else to play with & cuddle. This cheered my little girl up no end.   In a world so full of negativity & criticism  I thought it only right to let you know about this brilliant piece of customer service  & I hope Becky will get some sort of recognition for her hard work.  Kindest regards  Kelly					2016-08-22T17:30:23+0000	1471887023	2016-08-22 19:30:23	7	12	7	1	20	12	6	6	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon opening my starters for the evening I thought it was going to be just another normal Monday evening tea. But we where celebrating this evening so thought we would go all out and purchased tescos 12 mozzarella sticks. Yes it may seem a bit optimistic between the two of us but what the hell. I opened the packet  tipped them on to the tray and set them out neatly (2 rows of 6). But wait there s an extra one? I m never ever this lucky to get something for free but I couldn t believe my luck. The only issue I had was that we couldn t split them equally without halving the 13th stick. I can t even have my tray set out equally which missed my ocd up a tad. I just didn t know what to do with it  should I have dropped it on the floor and have to put it in the bin. Do I let my significant other have the extra one. After all why should the love of my life not be treated to this luck too. After so much debating I thought what the hell stop being so silly and put it in the oven. So I pick the tray up make my way to the oven and it s gone......its fell off the tray an under the oven.  This isn t in any way a complaint but I just wanted to share with you the events of the evening and how upset I am now losing No13 (they say its unlucky for some....it was for that stick)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14045645_10155234090079478_9094470652590210484_n.jpg?oh=d445afc9766aecdcdf86970ba7700cc7&oe=5923811A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14045645_10155234090079478_9094470652590210484_n.jpg?oh=6d196eada7d79fff7bae097e4936c9dc&oe=591DFC17	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155234090079478&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-22T17:09:17+0000	1471885757	2016-08-22 19:09:17	20	8	29	2	39	5	5	0	25	0	19	1	0	7	1	0	0

I been to Tesco Orpington store today. At the car park security staff Viktor offered me a help to put my wheelchair in my car. I kindly refused his help. When I got home I realised I lost my phone. When I rang Viktor answered my phone. Luckily he had to go his car and on his way back he noticed a lady picking up phone from the bay where I parked my car. His observation and great memory made him realise it could be my phone and he was right. He handed my phone back to me in one piece. His kindness and attitude is priceless. Thank you very much big man.					2016-08-22T15:47:30+0000	1471880850	2016-08-22 17:47:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were volunteering for Providence Row feeding the homeless on Friday 19th August when he really surprised us with his kindness. We had a strict budget and asked the Raashid (the deputy manager) if there was any form of discount he could provide us with. As an act of generosity he  out of his own pocket  paid for the food. This was such a thoughtful act from this gentleman  he put big smiles on a lot of faces that afternoon.  Raashid  thank you once again for your generosity and kind nature. I really hope that you see this and know what a difference you made on Friday.					2016-08-22T13:38:19+0000	1471873099	2016-08-22 15:38:19	2	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

I have recently bought the Homemaker magazine  packaged with 50 More Toys to Sew. However  most of the patterns in 50 More... are on a pattern sheet that was NOT included.   I understand not including the free kit that this magazine was originally sold with  but not including the pattern sheet means we cannot make most of the toys!   I have searched around on Sew Magazine s website and managed to find two or three of the patterns  but there are still quite a few that I m interested in but unable to find. I d really appreciate a suggestion on how to obtain the patterns  otherwise what is the point of offering the magazine to your customers?					2016-08-22T12:34:07+0000	1471869247	2016-08-22 14:34:07	0	13	0	0	13	13	2	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I returned to work and cooked said prawn biryani  opened it and to my disgust there was 4 tiny prawns  if I wanted a vegetable biryani I would ve bought one. Also  paying a premium for the prawns and this lack of this I do not find acceptable!

My mum recently won £20 on a scratch card and took it to your Goole store to claim it. As she doesn t do scratch cards often she was un aware of how they work  but I checked the card which showed 3 matching amounts of £20. I also won on the same type scratch card and cashed it elsewhere. So I am absolutely disgusted that the collegue that served my mum told her it had only won £10 and that you don t win 3 matching amounts you win whatever the bar code says. My mum been too polite didn t challenge this. I am so angry that this store collegue has dwindled my mum out of half her winnings when she hardly ever wins anything. Very disappointed customer 😕  T whiting					2016-08-22T11:01:03+0000	1471863663	2016-08-22 13:01:03	0	9	0	0	9	9	2	7	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Pack the perfect lunchbox for you little ones...... ? Tesco you really need to re-look at the message you re sending out  most (if not all schools) would not allow half (if any) of these items shown in this ad in a little ones lunchbox  curly wurlys? Smarties? Hoola hoops? Fruit shoots? As a leading retailer in our country you should be setting a good example  not encouraging little ones to eat rubbish!!!! How about just price matching the healthy stuff  fruit  veg etc not the high fat  high sugar branded foods???? Also if the response is either you had no idea this was being posted (sack your social media representative) or to delete my post then that just says it all really.   https://www.facebook.com/tesco/videos/1163143753744754/	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/14030501_1163143780411418_1105850907_n.jpg?oh=bdf45eb228534d935b7a9869a5b587fc&oe=58E23051	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s720x720/14030501_1163143780411418_1105850907_n.jpg?oh=d2a8cafffaa34b6c10a3980038cc821a&oe=591EC381	https://www.facebook.com/tesco/videos/1163143753744754/	facebook.com	2016-08-22T10:53:52+0000	1471863232	2016-08-22 12:53:52	3	9	3	0	12	9	2	7	5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked if she was with a group of friends  she was alone the store was also empty at the time. I asked a member of staff if this was company policy and was informed that it was. Whilst I appreciate having large groups of schoolchildren in the store may prove disruptive I see absolutely no reason why pupils can not go into the store alone or even in pairs. Parents are not perfect  what if a child needs something for their lunch or a more personal product. The explanation of  well if she asks a member of staff at the door to get the thing she wants they might get it for her  I m sorry this is just not good enough this store is discriminating a group of customers due to the behaviour of a few and it s just not acceptable. I would love to see the document  which shows that this kind of practice is Tesco policy?					2016-08-22T10:01:20+0000	1471860080	2016-08-22 12:01:20	2	5	3	0	8	5	1	4	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

I needed to sort out a problem on my credit card - quick polite sorted. Then a problem with my login - quick polite sorted. Then visited Bidston moss store today where the lady on school clothes went over and above the call of duty Great customer service. Always tills free never any queueing like some other stores. We are always quick to complain but I like to give credit where it s due. Thank you					2016-08-22T09:51:26+0000	1471859486	2016-08-22 11:51:26	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not a usual day for me  but I was aware I could start shop before 10 just not pay until the tills came on at 10am.  I was very disappointed to find that I was unable to use the personal scanner machines located just inside the door until 10am! To me this doesn t make sense.  I like to pack as I go saving me time and then pay quickly and go.  This ll not to be on a Sunday before 10am.  I asked at customer service  why this was.  The young man just said that it s because the tills don t open til 10!

I am sick of throwing loaves of bread away - within a couple of days they are completely mouldy despite being stored correctly and in date. I can only think they are not being stored correctly or kept for too long before being put on the shelves- probably the latter as even bread on the day of purchase is never fresh but stale.					2016-08-22T08:38:13+0000	1471855093	2016-08-22 10:38:13	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is not just your cheaper farm brand I ve tried the maris piper too (pictured) and they are rotten and need peeling to nothing. This is not just an odd bag either this is ever bag I buy is rotten. I tried Aldi thinking perhaps we had a bad potato crop or something but just their basic potato and it s fine  peel and chop without rotten anything  not one  all I threw away was peelings not most of a bag of potatoes. So I really think you need to look at your potato suppliers or who picks the suppliers or whatever the process as although I appreciate you can t see below the surface of the potato  Aldi clearly are doing something right in choosing their suppliers.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13962590_1729945037254643_5923745701205860308_n.jpg?oh=8293a1b2f48707e8cc063b6efca00ddf&oe=59203455	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13962590_1729945037254643_5923745701205860308_n.jpg?oh=2e3857d15beb36f83fc08648a805af04&oe=58DCC440	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1729945037254643&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-22T08:23:28+0000	1471854208	2016-08-22 10:23:28	5	12	6	0	18	11	3	8	5	0	5	0	1	0	0	0	0

I brought the Phone holder from your garage in walsall just before i went on the motorway for the first time on a holiday trip. Half way through my journey your phone holder bounces off of my screen along with my phone.  I refuse to use the sticker pad that comes with it and was pleased to see it had a suction pad.

Your advert depicting a Scots Guard is both insulting and totally lacking in respect for the regiment. Children mocking the soldier s march and pushing the bearskin.   Have some respect for our armed forces. What example is this to set to children?  😡					2016-08-22T07:43:45+0000	1471851825	2016-08-22 09:43:45	4	3	4	0	7	3	3	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a regular customer who often pops in for a   Meal Deal  and has also on multiple occasions visited for specific items that turned out not to be in stock I consider this charge excessive.  As a regular customer I can also appreciate the need to cut down on non-customers using the car park because it s free; there have been so many times I ve spent 20+ minutes driving round looking for a space  but if this system is implemented I will be taking my custom back to Asda. At least there if I cannot find what I m looking for in-store I wont be charged £5 just for the privilege of an unsuccessful visit.  I m not the only person who feels this way. You only have to read the comments on the Hull Daily Mail s Facebook post.					2016-08-22T07:29:57+0000	1471850997	2016-08-22 09:29:57	0	4	0	1	5	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s destroyed the toys  it s on my hands from trying to remove the batteries  and as you can see  it s even leaked out of the casing and onto the toy. My kids are 4 and 7  so unsafe!! Imagine if these had been put in an babies toy that a baby would have in its mouth?

Every night at the same time the same hoard of people turn up and wait in a pack  I say pack because they act like a bunch of animals when the produce goes out.  There is no consideration for your staff what so ever! Maybe a manger should put the produce out and see how these staff members have to deal with these poor excuses of humans! They barge your staff out the way  demand it gets reduced further  also they surround your staff making them uncomfortable  intimerdated and closed in  a it s YOUR duty at there employer to make sure they are safe whilst on your premises.  Also these people don t even think about others who may want a bargin too but are more than happy with 1 pack not the hole amount! Have u ever thought about staggering the times you put these products out during the day so your other loyal customers can have a look without the fear of being attacked because heaven forbid we should also get a deal! These people dive in like a  pack of animals  and should be utterly ashamed of them self s  everyone wants a barging but at what cost to your staff!					2016-08-21T20:23:36+0000	1471811016	2016-08-21 22:23:36	14	10	15	1	26	10	7	3	4	0	13	1	0	0	0	0	0

Every little helps ... and we apologies in advance for any mild inconveniences that may be caused.   Sometimes when I m sad  I scroll through these comments. I find myself feeling better about my life when I see how over dramatic and petty people can be.   Have a good day  Tesco!

When I got home I started preparing my lunch only to find the tomatoes I purchased were disgusting. The best before date was 23rd August so I expected better quality than what I got  One tomato was rotten and the rest weren t far behind it. It says on the packet that your produce is expertly selected for freshness and quality. I can safely say whoever passed these tomatoes should have taken a closer inspection. One dissapointed customer who will now be buying her fresh produce elsewhere in future.					2016-08-21T19:39:07+0000	1471808347	2016-08-21 21:39:07	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m just wondering..... if we were to use our clubcard vouchers for a day out  (birdworld) are we able to use them towards the family ticket and then pay the outstanding amount.  We don t quite have enough for a full family ticket so was wondering if we could just pay the remainder towards the ticket after using the clubcard vouchers.

The other day  I was able to purchase a pack of 2 trousers for my son. Very reasonably priced and in the past have stood the test of time. Marvelous! However  when I browsed my local store (AND later online) I couldn t find a  pack of 2  for any culottes  skirts or  girl  trousers. The only female things I saw sold in a double pack were cycling shorts.  Have I missed something on the website? Or do the parents of girls need to pay £10 for 2 trousers / skirts / culottes  as opposed to those of boys who can pay £5 for 2 trouser? Whilst I appreciate that the  boys  variety could be seen as gender neutral  surely the same opportunity of choice should be available!? (The little heart shaped dangly thing cannot possibly cost the extra £5 to quantify?)					2016-08-21T18:51:58+0000	1471805518	2016-08-21 20:51:58	4	10	4	0	14	10	4	6	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Even crumbs from  gluten  containing products can cause him to become extremely unwell. Gluten free products are so expensive in comparison to gluten containing  normal  food. It is very unfair as this is an autoimmune disease not some fad diet!!! Below is the quality of bread that Tesco expect my son to eat and charge me £2 for just 1small loaf!!!!

I have a disabled daughter who does not fit in the normal sized trolleys. She cannot walk very far and the trolleys like the one in the picture is a God send for us. Unfortunately we find repeatedly a lot of parents put their children who can fit in regular trolleys in these meaning I either have to carry my daughter and try and shop at the same time or leave to go some where else. Could you please clairfly that these are for children with special needs please? For instance last week I was going towards the trolley holding my daughter and a woman quickly put her small children in there and started saying how fun it was for her children. To make matters worse she was with someone with a double trolley which she could of used. I then had to carry my child while juggling with the shopping while the woman was whizzing around the shop not even using it to put stuff in. Also there is only one available at my local Tescos which is not enough.

We open our chicken to see this awful sight  and met with an even worse smell! So bad that my husband was almost sick! Now the funny thing is it was still in date (see photo in comments)! So we are now without a dinner for tonight  shops closed so can t replace. We always shop with Tesco and are very happy normally but this is awful. I hope to hear from you soon with some kind of resolution to this.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13939375_10153745201161717_6739895424064395037_n.jpg?oh=c94134a7c8c9c27a2ed1cbc463a28ed5&oe=591F640C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13939375_10153745201161717_6739895424064395037_n.jpg?oh=c97bb110fa8a1223a0a35aeb7ee409b4&oe=58E12301	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153745201161717&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-21T17:41:43+0000	1471801303	2016-08-21 19:41:43	0	9	0	0	9	8	5	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just a very quick moan about the new lid design on your baby wipes.... I opened a pack of them this morning and will have to open another pack tomorrow as the new design has made it very easy for my 11 month old to open and empty the pack  something that he was unable to do before. I think it is due to the new lip sticking out whereas with the previous design it was inset. Kudos to the designer if they are getting a share of the baby wipes profits. Thanks - he had great fun emptying them. Xx					2016-08-21T17:36:17+0000	1471800977	2016-08-21 19:36:17	3	22	8	0	30	21	9	12	25	0	3	0	0	5	0	0	0

So  of course I made my way to my local Tesco in Lanark. Bought my veg. Potatoes and a whole chicken......After cooking I started to strip it and found A LOT of water coming out of it  so much so that after it had been placed on a plate the water was still coming out of it. However I decided to put it onto the dinner plates along with everything else but sadly after we sat down to enjoy our Sunday dinner it only got worse. The chicken was vile so it went in the bin along with everything else on the plate! I think it s very fair for me to assume that the chicken was very much so injected with a lot of water to add weight. Well Tesco all I can really say is I will now be shopping further a field in Asda as I have never experienced any issues with any meat purchased from there in any of their stores. Thanks for leaving us starving and feeling let down as well as us missing out on a Sunday dinner!					2016-08-21T17:27:15+0000	1471800435	2016-08-21 19:27:15	0	8	0	0	8	8	3	5	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Checking a 44-page list of products for one item is completely impractical when shopping in-store. Tesco’s own vegan label printed on the packaging of all suitable products would be much more useful.

I noticed there was a cheaper punnet labelled  perfectly imperfect strawberries  of which I alerted my boyfriend  Michael  to.   Michael was saddened  to say the least.  What? Are you kidding me? This is what is wrong with society when we label things as  perfect . Show me the perfect strawberry. Who is to say that an imperfect strawberry isn t perfect in its own way?    My question to you Tesco is: should we be promoting perfection against imperfection  when in truth all strawberries deserve to be eaten (with cream)?

Just wondered as the cafe has run out of baked beans!  So they said they could either just take the money for the beans off of the all day breakfast or you could add something on  so decided would have toast added on  one slice of toast and it cost an extra 20p on top of the rice of the breakfast!  I don t normally complain but I am just concerned if this is done May times in a day it could end up putting customers off.  Could you explain this please?

I just wanted to say I m really impressed by the whole process.   I am normally forgetful so the ability to add extra items on after you ve placed an order is a great idea. Also the food arrived promptly and I was really impressed by the fact that all the items had long dates on  in fact one thing we ordered had a shorter date (which was fine as I could freeze it) but the delivery driver pointed this out to us and we didn t have to accept it if we didn t want to.  Finally the delivery driver was really nice and helpful and didn t grumble about having to come up to the 9th floor!  Just wanted to give credit where credit is due  Tesco seemed to have improved a lot in my eyes lately especially with the range of gluten free products on offer in all stores.					2016-08-21T13:49:21+0000	1471787361	2016-08-21 15:49:21	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered 4 trays and they were delivered quite promptly and my order was complete so I have no worries about that.  I am worried   though   by the size of the box and the amount of paper needed to fill it.  This is not necessary  and unfortunately I can t recycle the paper because it doesn t  tear white .  Which means it has to go into landfill.  Surely a jiffy bag would have done?  Also the couriers and delivery drivers would have more space. Please please please review your packaging and make a little difference to our planet.  Thank you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14051640_10207195584310414_1651698027541452181_n.jpg?oh=a95afa8b0258ad70873d3b9bf36b8d39&oe=58EFF4A0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14051640_10207195584310414_1651698027541452181_n.jpg?oh=405abae7e623246b235c1478417aa0ae&oe=58E4E6AD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207195584310414&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-21T11:35:20+0000	1471779320	2016-08-21 13:35:20	6	6	7	0	13	6	6	0	9	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	0

I asked him if I could have some strawberries  I could see them but they was quite far down. His reply was  This isn t my department  and carried on with what he was doing. I tried to lift the trays so I could get out some strawberries  but couldn t do  with the assistant totally ignoring me. I didn t even bother to ask for red grapes  left my basket and went across the road to Sainsburys.

However there was also a roll of wrapping paper amongst the order. Something that I didn t think needed to be packaged much  if at all. Please see the attached photos of the items packaging and kindly inform me why this is necessary when the world is trying to cut down  hence the charge for carrier bags now.   Many thanks.

I ve just went and made it and was met with a horrific smell. Upon checking the chocolate pudding it looked like it may have been over zapped in the micro but the smell was just too bad. I ve now checked the date of the puddings bought today and they went out of date on the 4 August. This makes them 16 days out of date and they were still at the front of your standard dessert shelves when they were bought.  I find it highly frustrating that we frequently shop in store and this is not the first issue we have had with products going out of date or being out of date on the shelves.  Please could someone contact me about this?					2016-08-20T22:54:55+0000	1471733695	2016-08-21 00:54:55	5	4	5	0	9	4	3	1	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

After a hard week as a single full time working mum of 4  today was the day of the weekly shop 🙈 A tad tired I let the twins push their mini trollies around whilst my 6 year old navigated the isles with the big trolley... I was fully expecting a health & safety platinum inspection (twins  not. nearly 2 in charge of a plastic vehicle...I must add this was on a Saturday lunchtime 🙈 Yes there were a few comments and a bit of tutting from fellow shoppers but the staff were amazing!! As soon as we walked through the door the kids were given their complimentary fruit. Every isle and counter we were greeted with cheer and praise  which made me as the mummy feel a million dollars!

A few weeks ago my 11 year old daughter wrote a letter complaining at the lack of variety in the clothes on offer for girls her age. I attach the reply she received from Jamie. She is over the moon and honestly so are my husband and I - we encouraged her to write but we weren t expecting such a thoughtful reply. Many thanks for proving us wrong and making my daughter s day.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14021716_10153800191942227_1458004417468570080_n.jpg?oh=f6ce319c85593f5f537ee272d70779ac&oe=5922EA81	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14021716_10153800191942227_1458004417468570080_n.jpg?oh=3df9a6b0cf6de654323b94aeefdcd50c&oe=58E0B28C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153800191942227&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-20T19:57:49+0000	1471723069	2016-08-20 21:57:49	44	4	46	3	53	4	4	0	0	0	44	2	0	0	0	0	0

At about 3:30 pm today I came into contact with a very helpful young lad called Sam  he could see I was struggling with my basket and looking for a checkout. He came over to me and said let me carry your basket and opened up another till as it was very busy. He was very kind and all he wanted to do was speed up the till service for every one not just myself  he was fast and efficient Whilst still giving amazing service. Please pass on my thanks to Sam and tell him he has amazing service. He was on till 5 at around 3:30.					2016-08-20T17:57:41+0000	1471715861	2016-08-20 19:57:41	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every single week there are things that are virtually out of date  sub standard quality or completely wrong. We had three packs of the same meat in this same shop that they had only bothered to scan one of the packs three times. All three were different weights and prices  so it cost us £1.09 more to buy than it should have!  Seriously Tesco your pickers are supposed to shop as if it was for them but this is not happening.  Unhappy customer.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14045826_10209547849763746_5800353764786623413_n.jpg?oh=6fdc075e268a4c49b1d26846861c898c&oe=58D9CC35	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14045826_10209547849763746_5800353764786623413_n.jpg?oh=1366690850ac87682c4a34035c441c47&oe=58D6B638	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209547849763746&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-20T17:47:48+0000	1471715268	2016-08-20 19:47:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They warned me to keep my purse safe as one of them had here purse stolen from her bag whilst in the store. She asked for help and for the staff to check the CCTV to be told they couldn t access it as it wasn t working and that was it. She said the staff didn t offer her any help at all. I find it very hard to believe that the CCTV isn t working in such a busy store. The lady that had her purse stolen was visiting from Poole. I understand that Tesco isn t responsible for the theft but the staff could have been more considerate.					2016-08-20T16:19:31+0000	1471709971	2016-08-20 18:19:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was advised yes there was a wheelchair I could borrow. We made are way to the store got the wheelchair an did our shopping. We then headed to the checkouts to pay  my daughter was becoming more and more distressed  we were met at the checkout by a lovely lady Lisa (she advised she was normally on the customer service desk) she talked to my daughter the whole time whilst scanning our items. We then had finished our purchases and Lisa gave our daughter a bar of chocolate an came out an gave her a big hug. By the time we left the store we had a happy 7 year old an a less frazzled mummy. So a massive thank u to Lisa she is a credit to the Cullompton team xxx					2016-08-20T12:57:19+0000	1471697839	2016-08-20 14:57:19	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This trip cost us in excess of £150. On reaching our car to put our shopping into the boot we were approached by one of the security guards and asked to produce our receipt as we left the store suspiciously. I have never been accused of shoplifting in my life. Shame on you @tesco if this is the way you treat your customers and really doesn t make me want to use that store in the future. #insulted #annoyed					2016-08-20T12:34:29+0000	1471696469	2016-08-20 14:34:29	1	5	2	0	7	5	3	2	11	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So last weekend I took it back to Tesco having my till receipt  as the electrical counter the assistant could not issue a refund because we had not contact the number of the receipt and obtain a special reference  as the receipt had been torn off the machine in the wrong place at time of issuing  it had torn off the special numbers and only left the date and time of purchase.  We were told that they had to do a search against my club card to confirm that I had purchased the item  bearing in mind I had the till receipt in my hand  anyway we went away and received a call last Tuesday to obtain permission from me to search the club cards records.  As to date we had not received any call back so today we rang to find out was happening only to be told that we will not receive the fund because the search could not find the brought item on that day  and therefore there is no proof of purchase  and have been told that if we go back to the store and they will accept the till receipt along with my club card and debit card and proof of identity and the store accept this as proof of purchase and then they ring the number of the receipt to confirm this I may get a refund   Can anyone advise me what more can I do to prove I have purchased this item  I am a pensioner and can not afford to loose this money  i think  after this I will no longer be a Tesco customer					2016-08-20T12:30:47+0000	1471696247	2016-08-20 14:30:47	0	22	0	3	25	22	11	11	12	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Something was going involving first aid (I don t no what it was hope who ever it was is ok) which had the attention of the majority of the staff which is understandable when something happens at your place of work you want to know. Well Shirley (red hair) on scan and pay this morning. Went above and beyond to help me. Helped me pack my shopping when I was on my own with my son because I forgot to do it whilst scanning and shopping she was generally a very friendly member of staff. Just wanted to give her the recognition. 👌🏻 thank you!					2016-08-20T12:14:44+0000	1471695284	2016-08-20 14:14:44	13	13	15	0	28	13	7	6	6	0	13	2	0	0	0	0	0

Delivery drivers should do the same before distributing them to the customers.					2016-08-20T12:09:37+0000	1471694977	2016-08-20 14:09:37	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Employee of the year award should go to JO RICHARDSON who was helpful above and beyond the call of duty.  My husband and I were in the Westwood store having just had an issue at a local guest house. I was quite upset; Jo saw this and asked if everything was okay. My husband explained our dilemma and  Super Jo  went into superior customer service mode!  She went out of her way to contact someone she knew (a colleague called Andy) to check on alternative accommodation; she then contacted the landlady of that guest house & arranged a room for us.  Due to Jo s assistance our holiday ended happily; if it hadn t have been for her help  our holiday would have been ruined.   Thank you Jo and thank you Tesco - as your motto says  Every little helps . Employees like Jo really are a credit to your company.					2016-08-20T12:04:45+0000	1471694685	2016-08-20 14:04:45	43	6	44	4	54	6	5	1	16	0	43	1	0	0	0	0	0

Like you are going to read the small print when the sign says ANY 6 bottles of wine. Tell me who has time to read the small print on banners when shopping with children who are bored. Tesco  change your banners to say 25% off 6 bottles of wine that cost over £4. I now wont be going back to Tesco to do a weekly shop because I don t like feeling like I have been cheated because I don t have time to check every little bit of wording on their offers. �#�fedupofsupermarketsrobbingcustomers�.					2016-08-20T11:51:33+0000	1471693893	2016-08-20 13:51:33	1	11	2	0	13	11	3	8	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I see you no longer carry Santa Maria mexican food products  and now you don t carry Wilkin and Son s products.  It seems you only carry one line (yours) and one more alternative option for products and that is all.  How much more are you phasing out for your own line?  I am not a fan of your line and this makes me shop elsewhere.  Very disappointing.					2016-08-20T10:44:23+0000	1471689863	2016-08-20 12:44:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The online transaction went through and even went through a secure authentication with the bank. Received an email from Tesco shortly after  confirming my order. Get to the store about 10.15am to be told there is now a problem with the card I used and have no shopping. No other explanation  no phone call/email before I bother to drive to get it. Even though the man on the phone assures me they tried to contact me  but didn t believe me when I said I had no missed calls or emails. I am completely disappointed and so are my children as we now have no shopping and I now have to drag them round another shop to get the stuff we need for our holiday.

Went to customer service desk to suggest that this could be easily rectified however the gentleman suggested being gluten free was my own fault the lady at the desk did have better customer service skills. Went to Sainsbury s this week and the cafe staff were great being able to provide a breakfast bap even though their delivery of gluten free rolls had not arrived.

Major fail in so many ways. After over an hour  gave up. So rang - got cut off by Rose 1st time of trying. Got through and had to dictate whole order again (thought of single customer view?) Only to find that agent had placed it to my husbands account (Data protection??) Anyway  that didn t work as my vouchers not valid  so agent now re-doing the whole of the order. She says she will ring me back. Let s wait and see. My channel of choice is online  this process requires maximum customer effort and is fatally flawed in terms of customer journey.					2016-08-20T09:22:36+0000	1471684956	2016-08-20 11:22:36	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased 3 packs of the root vegetable medley for the children to play with in the role play areas.  2 of the packs were fine and went straight in the room.  The 3rd pack was not!  There was a buzzing noise coming from it  which didn t start until I had taken it into my office at the nursery. Luckily I hadn t just given it to the rooms to open because underneath the wrapping there was what looked like a huge hornet  or similar.  We let it go safely BUT had it gone straight into a room it could have been very different!  What if a child had got hold of it or been stung?  I was shocked that it hadn t been detected by the noise it was making.  I have attached photos for you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14051690_10153681966651479_7490310344652320670_n.jpg?oh=61b1a8d6a2e885de6199a53a94c28e81&oe=58EBE920	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14051690_10153681966651479_7490310344652320670_n.jpg?oh=2445fbf0dd85e9829f84b3bd9062f095&oe=58EB732D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153681966651479&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-20T07:06:58+0000	1471676818	2016-08-20 09:06:58	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Do you take ghosts payment like Asda do? If I was to order a deliver for next week would my money be taken out my account there & then? Or on the day of delivery which would be the day after I get paid?  I was left with no food after doing my first ever shop and being charged twice by Asda for my shopping then having to spend all day trying to get my money back! It s put me off doing another online shop 😩  I m trying to get more organised with my shopping to save time and money   Advice would be great  Thanks					2016-08-19T22:02:34+0000	1471644154	2016-08-20 00:02:34	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also no impressed with price changing  one week munch bunch 30% less sugar is 62p per 6 pack  then £1.79  then 2 for £2  milkshakes 3 pack was 75p  this week its £1 and you have the cheek to tell me I saved 25p on it!!

I had a little disappointed visit today to tesco cafe.... 2 hungry kids and looking a bit bedraggled 3:50pm.... still with the dreaded Friday shop to do... kids asked if they could have tea in the cafe.... sod it why not... because let s face it after a marathon shop with enough to feed an army there never is really anything in for tea once you ve unpacked is there.... so I m stood at this hot food counter waiting to place my order.... looking at the beautiful sign of fish and chips. .. what s better than fish and chips on a Friday.... beats me but has to be fish and chips.... the ever demanding younger child didn t really care for fish but the older one had it in mind set... fish is the way forward... so in mind I thought nice one sort a lazy treat for the kids and myself then on with the shop.... so eventually a member of staff came came and told us to our surprise that they have no fish non no fish.... so I said what about the kids fish.... no we do have kids fish we have kids Scampi but we don t have fish.... well what other hot food do you have ?... my son says why don t you have chips   and gravy mum you like that (to be fair the gravy is spot on) they had no gravy!... so what have you got then.... Friday... tea time.... no fish.... panini....panini.... I could have a  panini....or chips.... but no fish and this was.... in Grimsby!.... just found it a bit disappointing thought I d let you know.....	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13962598_10209509327985369_180487314252314470_n.jpg?oh=a6c8d200051cbd95892240aabc932cd8&oe=58D749E9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13962598_10209509327985369_180487314252314470_n.jpg?oh=7d18800ffc6f6eb725de64f571f79f9a&oe=591C4CFC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209509327985369&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-19T21:46:56+0000	1471643216	2016-08-19 23:46:56	10	15	10	0	25	15	4	11	3	0	10	0	0	0	0	0	0

Driving home from setting up for a charity day and come up behind a Tescos delivery van  I slow down as thinks he s looking for the right house but it crosses to the other side of a country road without indication and starts to reverse into a small estate to then drive down the hill  yes  we do have Hills in Norfolk !!  I have stopped my car as I am sure he didn t even realise I was behind him  I shrug my shoulders at him and raise my hands and then start off up the hill  two minutes later the van in right on my bumper headlights blazing and proceeds to follow me. Quarter of the mile home I park in my drive  he stops the van and winds down the window and stares at small the time it takes me for  the three journey s to unpack my car !!  A lone lady driver !! I have never felt so threatened vulnerable and nervous !! This is two weeks ago tomorrow  and after several emails and promises of phone calls from managers.....very little  just a bunch of flowers after I mentioned it !! And empty promises of phone calls.........the slogan should be  very little no help......					2016-08-19T21:25:45+0000	1471641945	2016-08-19 23:25:45	2	9	4	17	30	9	8	1	6	0	2	0	0	0	1	1	0

I can honestly say that never in a million years  did I ever expect the service I received from Tesco home delivery.   I will not be using another shop again! Tesco 100% has my business from now on. From the quality of food  the friendliness of the driver (Derek from the Dunfermline Fire Station Store)  the explanation of how the receipt  refusal of items and money off items if they are cheaper elsewhere worked. I have never had such fantastic service.   The little welcome note with a handwritten name on it was a bonus too.   Thank you Tesco (and Derek) for reinstating my faith in home delivery! 😊					2016-08-19T21:18:00+0000	1471641480	2016-08-19 23:18:00	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Normally I go to my local tesco express for baby milk whilst I m doing the school run. With it been the school holidays I ve put my trust in yourselves to pick my baby milk. Over the past 2 wk I ve been a dissatisfied customer regarding the care of baby milk. Last week the little red tab on the milk was just attached  it was hanging on with an inch of its life  this week there was no tab attached so the foil lid and scoop was accessible. You may say this is a silly thing to be picky about but I m sure other parents will understand my dissatisfaction. I ve trusted you to pick my 7wk old sons milk.... how am I to know its not been tampered with and that it was on the shelf with the seel tab on or even in transit with it attached so I ve had to go to store and get a replacement which as a busy parent and not enough hours in the day (hence the click and collect been used) is a slight inconvenience. May I please make a suggestion? When the staff of tesco are scanning this product it be bagged and tied so incidences like this doesn t keep happening. I m rather reluctant to put this product on my shopping list again. I do hope you can take my suggestion into consideration and not just see me as a picky parent.

(They are the only retailers of this brand of toothbrush for miles around) I have been a customer for about 35 years spending approx £150 per week but I will never visit the store again as I am pretty miffed!					2016-08-19T20:29:47+0000	1471638587	2016-08-19 22:29:47	1	5	1	0	6	5	5	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been a loyal online grocery customer of yours for the last five years or so and in this time  I have never paid for garlic.  Never.  Every week  I order garlic and my receipt tells me that this product is  not available today  but when I open my bags  low and behold  the garlic is in fact there.  Over the weeks months and years  the same thing kept on happening and I ended up securing a large amount of garlic for free....enough to start my very own International Vampire-Killing business.  Alas  over time  the guilt has become too much to tolerate. I have mentioned the error to the odd Tesco delivery guy or two and they have merely shrugged their shoulders. But now  in the middle of the school holidays  I am publicly declaring my accidental crime to the world in the hope that you will send the police over to arrest me for my wicked  garlic-thieving ways.   I deserve to go to jail...for at least the remainder of the school holidays. I am sure my sugared-up  excessive-Paw Patrol-watching-whilst-swinging-from-the lampshade kids will cope without me whilst I sit quietly in a cell and reflect on my behaviour.  I m currently sat by the door waiting for the police to come. I ve even packed a small bottle of Prosecco and some snacks for the car journey to prison.  Come and get me quick...before I m forced yet again to get on all fours and bark like a dog to recreate my son s favourite scenes from Paw Patrol.  Yours truly   Katy.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14046154_10157314718060635_385489235741489520_n.jpg?oh=c2690eb02809dbc60c835d17b86a4552&oe=591CEE24	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14046154_10157314718060635_385489235741489520_n.jpg?oh=756a0880089823e0f146f7b174151c97&oe=59191A4F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157314718060635&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-19T19:59:04+0000	1471636744	2016-08-19 21:59:04	200	27	273	65	365	26	13	13	162	0	196	8	0	64	0	0	0

I can t stand the taste and I had to pour the whole bottle down the sink. If I wanted sweeteners I could choose the low-calorie version. I realise I should have checked the label  but I don t understand the logic of giving consumers no choice.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14079656_10206481025617304_7507663927035591988_n.jpg?oh=ab9a2b9eedf79aa63e2576abfa910fde&oe=58E0DB5F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14079656_10206481025617304_7507663927035591988_n.jpg?oh=4d1498fe815440378e0018b8086780cc&oe=58E79052	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206481025617304&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-19T15:34:15+0000	1471620855	2016-08-19 17:34:15	2	17	2	0	19	17	2	15	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

About 4 weeks my mother had an accident in Tesco store  leisure way  Lowestoft.  My mother who is disabled was on the produce Isle  she turned around and her foot caught a on a box  causing her to fall over!! But then about 10 empty boxes fell on top of her!!! The brusing is absolutely horrendous. Although the staff on duty at the time were very good  I have to say the aftercare has been absolutely awful!!! I am disgusted that there has not been one single phone call to see how my mother is!! We have made all phonecalls!!  My mother was sent flowers after I spoke to the store manager!!   My parents spend a lot of time and money in tesco and i cannot believe a multi million pound company cannot get in touch with my poor mum. Im not happy and thought it was time to get tesco moving along a bit  hopefully this will do the trick!! Im not here to cause trouble for tesco but I feel that this has happened in store and now noone actually cares about how my mum is or wants to take responsibility!!  My mum has been offered £25 compensation  this was after we had phoned the company 3 times!!!!					2016-08-19T15:03:13+0000	1471618993	2016-08-19 17:03:13	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As the van pulled up outside my house I noticed they had my TV on the lap of the passenger  it s a 48inch so the box was large. The box was very dirty with a large footprint on it  as shown on the photo  obviously been stepped on. Why was it on the floor in the first place? I waited for my partner to come home before I opened it as it would be too big to do on my own. Once out the box  we saw it s smashed on the left side and got a crack right across the screen  also shown in photos. I rang tesco straight away  told them what happened  how it was on the passengers lap and how dirty the box is but they didn t seem to be bothered. Rearranged collection of this one and delivery of new for Thursday between 7am-7pm so I have to waste my day waiting for this. I m starting to think if I should bother having another one. I would seriously reconsider who delivers your orders in future and take care of your stock.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14067440_10210419288065083_9111091612442725400_n.jpg?oh=ee468dfea713309e5c1d3df6f8133868&oe=591B1D70	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14067440_10210419288065083_9111091612442725400_n.jpg?oh=3c026a8cc516cfb4e30a4de08bf9d999&oe=58EDB87D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210419288065083&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-19T15:01:18+0000	1471618878	2016-08-19 17:01:18	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Stood in queue for 10 minutes  2 people ahead of me  one behind. The pharmacist was out the back & the ONE assistant disappeared out there NOT TO BE SEEN AGAIN in the time I queued. I left in the end  as I did last week. Despicable customer service  she could have popped her head out & acknowledged the queue by saying she d be out in a moment but NOTHING. AS IS USUAL AT THIS PHARMACY. I complained to a duty manager who shrugged her shoulders at me & 10 mins later I walked past to a queue of around 9 people! This pharmacy has a doctors surgery next door & the service they provide is just not on. I was in considerable pain today & just wanted a strong painkiller to take the edge off while I shopped with my 7 & 9 year old & my 78 year old nan.

On the 3rd August hours before I was due to fly out to Spain on holiday I was notified my account had been subject to fraud. Given assurances it would be sorted and that I had to change my email address  no problem....ha! What a joke!! Come back from holiday and attempt to do online shopping....only my passwords doesn t work. Click on link to reset only for it to tell me the link I receive by email has expired. I have now spent nearly two hours on the telephone to various technical support people who not only have spoken to me as though I am completely computer illiterate but the same issue keeps occuring. The upshot is I can no longer access my clubcard account.  lost all my clubcard vouchers and if I want to shop for groceries I have to close the account & re-register!!! Looks like I ll be shopping elsewhere  thanks for nothing Tesco!!!					2016-08-19T13:52:18+0000	1471614738	2016-08-19 15:52:18	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They always make me  my autistic little boy and his sister very welcome. They never moan that Oscar is sometimes extra noisy or that he throws his crusts all over their floor. If Oscar grabs at them and hugs or pulls at them they don t moan- they smile and talk to him 💙😊 they always speak to Isla rose and make sure she has plenty to do and make her giggle. 💜 they are all super from the waitresses  management and kitchen staff and cleaners! Thank you very  very much.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13962553_10210286922669401_2593413067270358264_n.jpg?oh=9d4be936d13fd94fa932a96695510df8&oe=58EA31C5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13962553_10210286922669401_2593413067270358264_n.jpg?oh=9011b40d716db66e3fb87fc6d8a4ef78&oe=58DA79C8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210286922669401&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-19T13:47:15+0000	1471614435	2016-08-19 15:47:15	31	6	31	6	43	6	5	1	10	0	31	0	0	0	0	0	0

These are absolutely dreadful- they give my Son a rash around the waistband  they leak  and they fall off! I ve always bought Pampers however they no longer do Active Fit in 6+ so I tried yours thinking they would be good. It was a complete waste of money and I wouldn t buy these again. Very disappointed.

However  sadly not many of them are actually labeled as such on the packaging  and although the list online is helpful  it s not practical when shopping in store!  Through the 8 years I have been free from animal products  i have noticed more and more tasty things arriving on your shelves suitable for me to eat. However  on quick shops I do not always have the time to read label after label to search out what is vegan and what is not  which means I buy the same things and could be missing out on new things you have to offer  and more often then not do quick shops elsewhere with more clear labelling so I can try new things more easily.  What are the chances that you could work on labelling all vegan suitable products as such?					2016-08-19T12:56:46+0000	1471611406	2016-08-19 14:56:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Kept him quiet for a while too lol Thank you tesco for fruit for kids.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14079732_10153973354801785_8145892317498368993_n.jpg?oh=e64970fe1e4bec020b394613539f0433&oe=59201164	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14079732_10153973354801785_8145892317498368993_n.jpg?oh=f4d4a4beaaf80df9e52f9470d18f9331&oe=591F8C69	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153973354801785&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-19T12:44:24+0000	1471610664	2016-08-19 14:44:24	4	0	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

It seems as though they are as attainable as a unicorn steak and not only that  your customer services team in fact know nothing about them.  This issue first arose after making a special effort to try and locate them in the London stores listed as stockists on your website.  None of the stores had them in stock which is why I contacted Customer Services.  The first person told me to check in the stores listed on your website (which was a point I had made clear in my first email) and then told me that there are supplier issues and they don t know when they ll be back in stock after telling me they are not in stock.  Another person apologised for the  rigmarole  and said that the confusion has arisen from the fact that Carolina Chillies go by another name and that they are the Komodo Dragon chillies and widely available.  I was stunned  especially given that the recent press release not only includes a graphic showing that Carolina is hotter than Komodo but that you started selling Komodo chillies in 2015 and that of course they are two entirely different chillies - I am still waiting for a response from Customer Services regarding this.  Your press announcement remains online as do the fanciful stockists and I really would like to know if  when and where in the country they will be available?					2016-08-19T12:40:33+0000	1471610433	2016-08-19 14:40:33	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

As soon as i opened the door he offered to bring my shopping straight in for me and unpack it all so i didnt have to put my daughter down to cry all the while chatting away to both myself and my daughter. He put a smile on my face and set me up for the afternoon.

At the time of buying the tablet we were torn between the Hudl   a Kindle  and another tablet (which I think was an Asus one).  We wanted to go away and check on reviews but were pressured into making a decision and took the advice of the store assistant and opted for the Hudl as we were assured our son would get at least 5 years out of it.  To protect it we also bought the Hudl specific case.   Our son rarely uses his tablet   but does play occasional games and research for his homework.  Unfortunately last week he went to switch it on and there was a problem with the screen.  I contacted Customer Service and this was looked into.  I was advised there was a known problem and the Hudl is no longer available   and repairs are no longer being offered and I had to wait on a call back to let me know what you will be offering.  I received contact today offering £35 towards a replacement.  I queried this as although the tablet is outside of its manufacturers warranty   the advice we were given upon buying the Hudl led us to believe that it was the better option instead of the Kindle   or an Asus tablet that was a similar price.  I was told Tesco don t stock Tablets at £35.00 and there is nothing else that can be done as it us a set figure you can offer.   I have looked online and information regarding the Sale Of Goods Act is quite vague but I feel the offer is derisory considering we must have spent over £120 on a gift that is useless after less than half of the time it was meant to last for.  Even the protective case we paid around £20 for is worthless.  We allow our son an hour a night on his tablet if he has been good during the day and he now feels he is being punished and is having  the worst school holidays ever . He is only 7 so hopefully the suffering will soon ease.   Is there really nothing further that can be done regarding this?  Any further help would be greatly appreciated.   Kind Regards					2016-08-19T11:58:19+0000	1471607899	2016-08-19 13:58:19	0	10	0	0	10	10	6	4	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Charged 69p for half a slice of toast and butter with my breakfast. No manager in to complain to either and the cafe staff were too stupid to accept a portion of toast obviously consists of a whole slice of bread! Pathetic.					2016-08-19T10:17:37+0000	1471601857	2016-08-19 12:17:37	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had some cheese ball crisps delivered with my online shop on 8th August and  when I opened them yesterday  they were all oozing oil. It says on the pack that they contain sunflower oil and we ve never bought them before but this surely isn t right is it? I emptied them onto a piece of kitchen roll so you can see all the oil which was literally dripping off. Have I just had a dud pack? They were stored sealed in a cool cupboard between delivery and opening yesterday and were still well in date.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14054178_10153589981046256_301318831251171596_n.jpg?oh=30adfe98e7a266943ea750d06b7f0dc9&oe=58DBF557	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14054178_10153589981046256_301318831251171596_n.jpg?oh=bf9ce54958795eee8f63f60713f719a7&oe=58EAA42B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153589981046256&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-19T10:09:45+0000	1471601385	2016-08-19 12:09:45	2	7	4	0	11	5	5	0	4	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0

This pack of courgettes was delivered to me on Sunday 14 Aug. I d normally expect courgettes to last a week in the fridge  and they generally do when purchased fresh. However  I got these out of the fridge on Wed 17 Aug and they were already soft and mushy  basically not edible. Just because I have my shopping delivered isn t an excuse to get rid of short dated stock. I m disappointed. The delivery drivers are great  it all works  except this. It s not possible to check the date on every product when taking delivery  I need to trust you  but you re making it hard !	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14063808_10157229502545184_1501533957278010441_n.jpg?oh=437733e2ee8fb9e87981ed6f0e62dd1b&oe=59241001	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14063808_10157229502545184_1501533957278010441_n.jpg?oh=d52288600cca2807b1b4ad5c28d601da&oe=58DCFB0C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157229502545184&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-19T09:32:24+0000	1471599144	2016-08-19 11:32:24	2	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Had an unexpected opportunity to visit the store whilst on holiday in the area. Even though we didn t need to partake  Tesco have put a small stand at the front of their stall with free Fruit for children to eat whilst they walk around their stall. I hope they roll this out across their entire network. Promotes healthy eating and choices. Well done Tesco.

I came into the store at 06:00AM in a panic as I ve left my bank card in the store. Simply asked if it had been handed in and the woman didn t seem bothered in the slightest.   Firstly told me we don t open here until 08:00  I then explain I m wondering if my bank card has been handed in here. In which her reply was I don t know. I then ask politely can you check for me  she says no I can t it might be in the cash office. Again I say can you phone or find out for me. Finally says no I can t do either of that I ll be able to in an hour.  Most extremely awkward middle aged woman with a very bad attitude and unhelpful.

Interestingly received after the event and works had commenced...hardly  keeping your community informed  . After having 2 hrs sleep Tuesday evening and 4 hrs yesterday I find the £1 off your next shop vouchers insulting. Also it s encouraging to know you are undertaking these works at your quietest times  Sunday through to Thursday night  . How selfless of you to maximise profits for yourself whilst allowing nearby residents maximum disruption to their necessary nights sleep! Thanks again for the £1 voucher but I think I ll be shopping elsewhere from here on in. Also the fact that your staff lied to me about works just taking place on a Sunday and not in the evenings makes you somewhat hypocritical. You really are only concerned with maximising profit.					2016-08-18T22:24:58+0000	1471559098	2016-08-19 00:24:58	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I do the 5 and 2 fasting diet and on my fasting days I soooo look forward to my T&M soup (like seriously look forward to it  as though it were a michelin starred creation). On fast day 1 this week (Monday) I opened the tin  to be confronted by a slightly different shade of soup - where once there was a vibrant orangey-red now lurked a murky orange.  I was a little concerned but gave it the benefit of doubt and served the soup up anyway...it was not a pleasant dining experience  I really struggled to finish.  Tonight  fast day 2 this week  I eagerly opened another can...it is murky orange.  In a last gasp I opened the third and final can in the cupboard and it is the same unappealing orange murkiness too. I m sad. After a day of self-inflicted fasting I now have the choice of suffering through this soup or a slice of toast.  Could you please advise whether the recipe has changed or have I unfortunately been the recipient of a bad batch??  Thank you!

(Responsibly within the government guidelines of course) As I m sure you already know Sainsburys have revealed their plans for a bottle under £3. Being a loyal tesco customer  I hope you can understand the discomfort it brings me to contemplate switching over to Sainsburys  however prosecco is a large part of our student lives now and I just dread to bare the thought of a life without it. It seems they re providing that little bit extra now and sadly every little helps  as you know well. I hope there can be some sort of way we can resolve this issue and move forward in our relationship.

About 3 months ago we purchased the fairy cozy coupe for my little girls 1st birthday  which is today. Last night my partner sat down to take it out the box and we realised it had bits missing. We went to the big tesco in Stockton-on-Tees and explained to them what was wrong. We spoke to a manager named mark and a blonde young lady who was on customer services both of whom were really helpful. They told me the item wasn t in stock in the store or online. I explained to them how my daughter s birthday was today and people would be arriving for visits . They persisted and rang other stores. They found one available in the Hartlepool store. Within 2 hours the click and collect department had travelled to Hartlepool and delivered the brand new fairy cozy coupe to our home. The driver named  Jamie who was also really polite apologised and handed a gift bag over and said Happy Birthday from Tesco  inside was a little Disney Princess soft toy   and the handwritten tag simply read  Happy Birthday ftom Tesco  . So from one little birthday princess thank you so so so much (she loves it) the Tesco staff who helped are a credit to you xx	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14055045_187118435034597_5358243934417145301_n.jpg?oh=806ed4a5da3fde68d03ba94c9e1d8214&oe=591BD2B5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14055045_187118435034597_5358243934417145301_n.jpg?oh=1dba2ce8adac7bad091257d141ebb0e1&oe=58DF184A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=187118435034597&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-18T18:33:08+0000	1471545188	2016-08-18 20:33:08	69	17	78	5	100	17	12	5	24	0	69	8	0	0	0	0	0

This evening I have 2 very happy children thanks to one of the colleagues in the Southampton store. My daughter (who is Pokemon mad) spotted the collectors tin on sale in the store and also notice that unfortunately someone had helped themselves to the signature card (the special one that is the reason you buy the tin).  She went and told a member of staff and we went to pay for our shopping.  While we were at the checkout the colleague my daughter told appeared with two packs of Pokemon cards for my daughter and for my son to say thank you.  It has really made their day! Thank you Jamie :)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13962667_10209928493110256_8740164607674207794_n.jpg?oh=936211b074e18b7af82b9a13052fd3ba&oe=58DAC6C2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13962667_10209928493110256_8740164607674207794_n.jpg?oh=90969d2552529ba272a719c76ae06be8&oe=58EA88CF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209928493110256&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-18T17:03:40+0000	1471539820	2016-08-18 19:03:40	7	7	7	0	14	6	4	2	4	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m really sorry to have to tell you this but we have uncovered another one of your employees. We believe he met his sad demise when my mum boiled the spinach he was hiding in. I would have given him the kiss of life but I m pretty sure he lost his head during the ordeal. I can only apologise for my mother s mistake. I think he may have lost his name badge during the boiling process so we have nicknamed him Sweetpea after the meal that he sacrificed himself for. Apologises again. �	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14088451_10209947979633197_7958377128532212051_n.jpg?oh=f7f47f456ec85453f1de145dd6c21405&oe=58E13185	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14088451_10209947979633197_7958377128532212051_n.jpg?oh=6d2ae6c587ea85f64a55e2d813affc5b&oe=591B2288	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209947979633197&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-18T16:33:15+0000	1471537995	2016-08-18 18:33:15	12	13	16	2	31	12	3	9	16	0	12	0	0	3	1	0	0

Lilly realised this as we got home and was left traumatised and in tears. After that we called Tesco s and luckily  some kind person had found it in the car park and handed the toy monkey in to customer services so we asked to pick it up the next day and they said it was fine.   Later the next day  we returned to Tesco s Barnstaple and collected Jo-Jo the monkey from customer services along with two written notes  a cute little banana for Jo-Jo and a bunch of bananas for Lilly.  We would love to say a massive thank you  to Tesco s Barnstaple the North Devon branch for looking after Jo-Jo the monkey and making my daughter very happy!  #tesco #tescobarnstaple #northdevon #tesconorthdevon #thankyou #excellentcustomerservices  #tescocustomerservices	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14063948_10154457396258420_4155583272254688503_n.jpg?oh=e214274fe3e64e320b827930370dfa82&oe=58EE5C5B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14063948_10154457396258420_4155583272254688503_n.jpg?oh=5301971ba647b05f627badf4a910c422&oe=59198056	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154457396258420&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-18T13:54:06+0000	1471528446	2016-08-18 15:54:06	7	1	9	0	10	1	1	0	3	0	7	2	0	0	0	0	0

Having been put on a low FODMAP diet the last 2 months I have had to buy everything fresh and make my dinners from scratch which as people know gets very expensive! Along side that I have had to go onto gluten free and dairy free food  for starters the prices are just so unfair! People do not choose to be ill yet they are penalized and have to spend more money! Just to buy snacks for a week its costing me over £10!  Anyways  I went to Tesco the other day to buy some gluten free biscuits... a pack of 5 and the price label says £3.75! I put it back on the shelf and walked out! Went down to Morrisons same make of biscuits were £2.50 or when on a deal £1.70! (See photo below for proof!)  So Tesco my question is  how can you think about charging this much for a pack of 5 biscuits! It is ridiculous! Needless to say I don t buy gluten free from you!   Another thing is the fact my partner went and brought a meal deal for his lunch when we were out a couple of weeks ago  I was quite hungry so went to look for a gluten free sandwich and guess what! No gluten free sandwiches wraps or pasta salads! What a joke! So people like me can t have food on the go because you can t cater for them! It doesn t take much to make some sandwiches up with the gluten free breas you get in!   Very disappointed with Tescos!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14045866_10207322604686694_2120674751441698696_n.jpg?oh=13e5e4cb79f90e2406c672e3bba96371&oe=591E9949	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14045866_10207322604686694_2120674751441698696_n.jpg?oh=ce466c9370decac871e800e3588b8743&oe=58E869EE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207322604686694&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-18T12:56:58+0000	1471525018	2016-08-18 14:56:58	2	3	2	0	5	2	1	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve had enough having to have this argument with my friends and family since brexit. I certanly dont need to be hearing it when im just trying to buy some gum and cigarettes in bloody tesco.

Now before I go on  broccoli has always been a big part of my life. Broccoli has provided me with the greens to grow  the strength to overcome challenges and has truly been the light at the end of my tunnel.  To my horror  my old nightmares have returned as I find a broccoli branded Tesco salad is in fact missing broccoli.  It s now down to you to save my relationship with broccoli.

This is the second time I have been to your cafe and once again I have walked up stairs which don t look as though they have swept or mopped in months.  To them walk into the cafe to see the glass panelling full of greasy  hand prints. Not to mention the dirty walls and floors and tables full of crumbs. It s no wonder there are only 2 other people in here! The toilets  are even worse. The whole place needs a deep clean. I would be surprised if this had been cleaned in the last week the level of filth and grime which is here.					2016-08-18T11:01:06+0000	1471518066	2016-08-18 13:01:06	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

He bought two packs of the yogurt pictured here. Now granted he should have checked the dates (as should I before using them) but you really wouldn t expect to have any product on the shelves dated three days out of date  (8/8)  especially yogurt. Unfortunately my baby who I m currently weaning did have three of these before I realised the dates and it explains his upset tummy. I certainly don t expect a yogurt product to be on the shelves out of date  most definitely not out of date three days prior.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13814053_10157334864625596_2707777911803538054_n.jpg?oh=722167a596d6e1719f318ab8371c1318&oe=58E58BBF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13814053_10157334864625596_2707777911803538054_n.jpg?oh=ccc6988a5568482db36b8d7a02e54af7&oe=59210EB2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157334864625596&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-18T10:29:41+0000	1471516181	2016-08-18 12:29:41	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a slight concern/issue with one of your  WaveRunner 600ml water bottles   Hopefully in the photo provided (full Size images in comments) you can see that the bottle has some what shrunk? It was purchased on the 6th August 2016.  I haven t put it in a dishwasher  just hand washed with soapy water and the occasional soak in the sink.   In its current new shape  the bottle is now unable to stand. I can no longer get the freezing cooler  part in as the holding capacity for liquid greatly reduced more than it would do  on a non faulty bottle.  Let s not get started on the shape it s now become 😱 nor it s new found bottom. 😳  I understand it s a £4.50 bottle  but it s had only 12 days of use. I can send a copy of the receipt. I can attach parts of it in the comments below.   Right now I have a miserable six year old as his new shiny bottle  that become an obsession now no longer stands alone  nor does he want to drink out of it at the sheer fear I have swapped it for a different bottle  that isn t his. 🙄   I would like to know how you are able to rectify this situation and explain to my now untrusting six year old I haven t swapped his bottle 😟  Many thanks  A disgruntled mother - that s had hell all morning 😖 (Just over two weeks until school starts though - but I need a bottle to turn my darling child a non monster again!)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14063985_1357812970914786_9188030474218218981_n.jpg?oh=c64588d83ddac3abfc9208cad3b8c084&oe=5922B945	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/14063985_1357812970914786_9188030474218218981_n.jpg?oh=3f87749152bd9ba9bd4adf56858c5360&oe=59243835	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1357812970914786&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-18T08:20:54+0000	1471508454	2016-08-18 10:20:54	0	11	0	1	12	11	5	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Extra praise to Porscha from the clothing department who made it all happen! Thank you!					2016-08-18T06:06:32+0000	1471500392	2016-08-18 08:06:32	2	6	2	0	8	6	2	4	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m from the south and we don t have Tesco where I m from.  But  I d like to remind everyone that it doesn t matter where you buy your fruits and veggies at  live--and dead--bugs in them is a very common occurrence! Whether it s a Stop-N-Shop in the New England region  Food Lion along the South East  Wal-Mart  Kroger  Farmers Markets in the deep South or some other store anywhere in the country--and out--bugs are a risk you take when buying fruits and vegetables!   This is WHY you re supposed to thoroughly wash your fruits and vegetables! To get them off.  So  stop whining about living and dead bugs on your fresh produce  suck it up  say  oh well!  And wash it off! It s not like it s a canned or frozen product that you ve opened and discovered a bug or--shiver--some other critter (or even a severed digit!) in!					2016-08-18T01:31:56+0000	1471483916	2016-08-18 03:31:56	9	4	10	0	14	4	4	0	1	0	7	1	0	0	0	0	0

I have noticed that some of your food and drink items are also branded with vegan or vegan friendly which is great and really helpful when I m shopping.  I do find  however  if some of your own brands are vegan friendly but you haven t put that they are  I don t buy them as I think there must be something in them that contains animal products.  Please will you consider marking all of your vegan food and drink products as vegan. This will make buying your products a lot easier. And as you say... Every little helps 😊					2016-08-17T23:22:21+0000	1471476141	2016-08-18 01:22:21	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your call centre staff  were completely useless  rude and uncooperative. My name clearly is Mr Towers  on the documents we got back I am now known as Mr Howard.   As soon as we saw the issue we called immediately  only to be met by another rude and impatient call handler  we was assured the details would be amended on the 17th of August. This is a great important to us as we needed to print these documents off as we are driving across Europe on Friday for a week or so. We went to re print these documents and yet  no name change.   I cannot stress the importance of this  the details need changing as soon as possible so I can have all the correct documents I need to continue with my holiday.   But come on  I work in a call centre myself  misspelling a name  is an honest mistake  giving me a complete different name is ridiculous. The phonetic alphabet should be used if the call handler has any issue with how to spell a name  especially on such an important document.   I look forward to hearing from someone from your service as soon as possible.					2016-08-17T20:37:26+0000	1471466246	2016-08-17 22:37:26	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.					2016-08-17T20:07:54+0000	1471464474	2016-08-17 22:07:54	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It has been fantastic  and it s lovely to work for a company that values their staff.   Working at Tesco has been life changing for me.  A lady came into the store today  and after being served by me  proceeded to tell my team that I was lovely and polite to her. I then got taken into a huddle and given some chocolates and a note from the lady  describing how the service that I gave  was great. Things like this mean a lot to me because I know what it s like to work for companies that don t appreciate the effort some staff put in. So now  I m celebrating.  It s lovely to feel valued.  Thank you  Tesco.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13925315_10209160834992455_5330418507362645322_n.jpg?oh=075fe8697a302929d34b0952bbc7fa40&oe=58E6903B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13925315_10209160834992455_5330418507362645322_n.jpg?oh=1e83f8bc29f0ee61be3d46ee62705496&oe=591F2C36	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209160834992455&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-17T19:27:11+0000	1471462031	2016-08-17 21:27:11	11	6	12	0	18	6	6	0	1	0	11	1	0	0	0	0	0

This afternoon my partner and I were doing our weekly shop; which happened to include a single bottle of Blue Lagoon cocktail mix (Vol 4%) at £2  when asked for ID he could produce his driving licence at aged 28 whilst I didn’t have mine on me. I appreciate there are laws surrounding the sale of alcohol  and rightly so  but there should be laws surrounding common sense!

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as we assume a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I know it is not easy to be awarded the V or vegan status but when you can I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.					2016-08-17T18:06:54+0000	1471457214	2016-08-17 20:06:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My  nearly 3 year old son sat it in for the first time today and I can t tell you how much more relaxing my shopping trip was knowing that he couldn t inadvertently injure himself by head butting the handle bar while I was putting something in the trolley.   This positive experience however was dampened by a security guard with little to no a)customer service skills and b) common sense. When leaving the store we unavoidably set off the security alarm (I fully understand why these valuable trolleys are tagged!) We were swiftly met by the guard who stated that under no circumstances could I leave the store with  that  trolley. Well Mr Security guard  how on earth do you expect me to carry my disabled son and my heavy shopping to the car. His response was a shrug. I then explained that the whole point of an adapted trolley was to make life easier and so by not being allowed to step out of the store with it simply defeated the object of having one in the first place!! Thankfully a lady behind the customer service desk told the security guard that  of course the lady can take the trolley to her car!    I believe that some of your staff desperately require some disability awareness training!					2016-08-17T18:01:16+0000	1471456876	2016-08-17 20:01:16	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I remembered from a few years ago with my older son that there were trollies that you could put your own baby carseat on  so i took him out of the car still in his carseat and struggled over with my large changing bag and shopping bags in tow to the trolly area to grab one to save waking him up. When i got to the trollies i couldnt find any  so asked a member of staff for help. I was unhelpfully told there should of been some there but as there werent any trolly staff in at that particular time they couldnt help me. Concequently i ended up struggling back to the car to take my baby out of his carseat (and wake him up) to put him in a trolly with a dirty baby seat on it  which was miles too big and completely unsuitable for a newborn. Of course the trolly i happened to chose had rickety wheels too so not only was his head wobbling around unsupported  but was banging on the side of the seat our entire visit! This was obviously very uncomfortable for him as he screamed the whole way around the shop! If one of the carseat trollies was available we would of had a problem & stress free experience  instead it was very stressful and not one i care to repeat again. Needless to say until this problem has been resolved i wont be visiting Tesco again. I shall be shopping at one of your competitors stores who value their customers with newborn babies.					2016-08-17T17:28:34+0000	1471454914	2016-08-17 19:28:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My thanks to the Manager Gary who went in search in the store room for the Cornetto that had sold out in the shelves in the ice cream section. He turned and found some on the end of aisle sales area and then came and found me. Thank you very much Gary - much needed in this weather. At the til Paige tried to redeem the money off voucher I had cut out of the August copy of the Tesco magazine. Having made several attempts Paige was unable to scan the coupon with my shopping and advised me to go to Customer Services. Between the time it took to wait in the queue and then be served by Kerri the ice cream had started to melt.  So  Tesco - can you find out why the cashiers can t redeem the coupons at the same time I am paying for my shopping. For all three assistants to helped me - thank you					2016-08-17T16:46:32+0000	1471452392	2016-08-17 18:46:32	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Much of the stock had moved location and we couldn t find half our shop. Mike knew where absolutely everything was  including things that hadn t moved which we don t normally buy. Without his assistance our shop would have been much more of a chore.

Off I trek across the road to my local tesco convenience store only to find that they don t have marmite! Like seriously? Now to be fair if they didn t carry marmite I may have been able to deal with that  but to see this revolting alternative of bovril  well it was too much! It reminds me of an incident I once experienced where a friend of mine asked me if I wanted marmite on toast and in fact gave me this  inducing the worst ten minutes of eye watering sickness I have ever endured! Seriously apart from this one strange friend of mine who even eats bovril? Very disappointed in you tesco  and hoping the family don t notice the missing ingredient!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14064297_10154452071297708_8654092550030733521_n.jpg?oh=7749f8e8f4277fd8d6ff410408b81d6e&oe=58DA4798	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14064297_10154452071297708_8654092550030733521_n.jpg?oh=d559a3f531967499726f4bb8b64236bb&oe=59211A95	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154452071297708&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-17T16:17:02+0000	1471450622	2016-08-17 18:17:02	2	12	3	0	15	12	6	6	5	0	2	0	0	0	1	0	0

In April I took my car to be cleaned along with a soft top clean. This cost £20 and took 40mins plus 1 hour 30mins wait. When I got the car back they had only done 2/3 of the roof and missed the middle completely. I complained and they offered a free wash and roof clean. Today I have taken it back to get my free roof clean and they told me that it was to long since I d had it done. At no point was a time limit mentioned on the free clean. He would not honour the free clean even though they failed to clean it in the first place. After I told him that there was no time limit stated he agreed to wash the car but will have to wait 1.5 - 2 hours. I can t wait 2 hours  When I asked who was waiting he couldn t say as there were no cars in the waiting bay. He has avoided cleaning the car from the start so I told him to forget it today at this point he ripped up the free car wash token so I could not have it back.

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.					2016-08-17T15:22:44+0000	1471447364	2016-08-17 17:22:44	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We would like to thank the managers and staff for making sure that our family feels safe and appreciated back in store. We recently witnessed an apprehended shoplifter in store  she was loud and aggressive and scared the children. Staff made sure we were okay on the day but now two weeks later  on arrival we were spoken to by the staff saying that they were thinking of us and gave the boys free magazines!

Fly spray in with brioche. Crackers next to bleach and washing powder. Fresh chicken next to soup. Melon with disinfectant spray. Soup with air freshener.

You were very kind by telling me they were ripen in the bowl ones and would be ripe on a few days....well...last Wednesday I purchased what I thought were the best out of a hard  hard bunch of fruit  nectarines  sun trail  to be exact. I purposely asked the lady if she thought these would be ripe in 2 days  more like 4 she says. I began to eat them on Monday and have just eaten the last. As I said in my last post  when I buy fruit I want them for my breakfast the next day  the day after at a push...not days and days later. Most annoying. Why can t we have fruit ready to eat  I know they would go bad if too ripe but come on!!					2016-08-17T14:10:43+0000	1471443043	2016-08-17 16:10:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am here on behalf of myself  anyone else in this country who is looking at going vegan and the current vegans in this country. I see that you already label your vegetarian products as  Suitable for vegetarians  - thanks.  However  there is a growing number of vegans in this country. Many people go vegan for animal rights/welfare  health  environmental  personal  perhaps religious and/or other reasons. Because of all these combined  there are about half a million vegans in this country  along with other people who reduce their intake of meat  dairy  eggs and/or other animal products.  Labelling vegan products as vegans would make things easier for all of these people  especially those who have a limited amount of time and/or are under pressure from parents and/or guardians. Because of this  I would like to politely ask that you label  all of your products that are vegan as vegan.   Thank you.					2016-08-17T13:09:56+0000	1471439396	2016-08-17 15:09:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I d like to know if school uniform is allocated to your stores taking into account the uniform colour schemes in each local area? (I appreciate that this would be extremely difficult centrally but local ordering would make it easier??)  I need navy and red uniform for my daughter and Tesco  my usual preference for uniform provision is severely lacking in our local store. I went further afield and found some nice trousers but no skirts or pinafores. Even the website is lacking. Surely navy isn t that uncommon?					2016-08-17T12:55:53+0000	1471438553	2016-08-17 14:55:53	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just marking products as  suitable for vegans  but not ensuring this on all products which are in fact fine for vegans just means that your vegan customers are missing some of the products you may have sold them if only they had been labelled appropriate! #MarkItVegan					2016-08-17T12:38:17+0000	1471437497	2016-08-17 14:38:17	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is really bloody annoying  after having taken a considerable amount of time to do a large grocery shop online  to then discover there is no way to pay by giftcard. This should really be made clear to customers before they waste their time filling their basket. It is not even made clear at the checkout. I had to waste more time on the phone to find this out. Please either change this  or make it clearer. Thank you.					2016-08-17T12:24:43+0000	1471436683	2016-08-17 14:24:43	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

ESPECIALLY after learning so much about your wonderful marketing promotion of buy an organic product and receive a nontraditional pet free. Not all your customers are the furry 4-legged pet types  so thinking outside the box and promoting a side of pet ownership not often in the limelight of marketing campaigns lightens my heart. I for one support you continuing this lovely campaign for alternative pet ownership!  Sincerely  A Colonist  P.S. Do you happen to have a sister store equivalent in Yankee territory with the same promotion? :)					2016-08-17T12:17:50+0000	1471436270	2016-08-17 14:17:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughters school has taken it upon itself to make you the exclusive supplier of their logo polo shirts. I have just ordered £70 worth of uniform  as I did last year without incident  and was asked to  reset my password . Already annoyed. I use the website once a year  my password is fairly secure  there are now EIGHT rules of what your password has to include. Considering I so infrequently use your website  I can imagine I m going to have to go through this rigmarole every time I want to order uniform as I ll have forgotten the over-complicated password by Christmas. I followed the link  twice  and tried to enter my  valid postcode  and my new  secure-as-max-jail  password only for your website to tell me that my postcode is invalid. I have wasted an hour of my day going back and forth  entering the same postcode  of the address I actually live at  only to be told it isn t valid.  It s completely over the top to make your customers change their passwords to something unfathomable difficult to recall in the first place. Try investing in guarding their personal data instead.  I am absolutely exasperated. Sort your system out. I am being forced to buy uniform from you  I absolutely would not use your terrible internet shopping option without my hand being forced.					2016-08-17T12:02:12+0000	1471435332	2016-08-17 14:02:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I contacted you last week to warn you of this dangerous item which could kill a small pet.  Rotastak have been producing this item with complaints coming in left right and centre  many photos of mould coming in from all over uk on these products for over a year and yet Rotastak still produce it.  I was told this matter would be looked into I hoped the evidence and complaints clearly on rotastaks facebook page would be enough to remove these from sale.  Since my complaint I am saddened to see they are still for sale.  I am further saddened to see another person has received contaminated stock yesterday from a Tesco store  so nothing has been done. Please make sure this is looked into urgency and removed from sale  pets could die from these. Thank you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14034872_10210504781875626_1792416620732539543_n.jpg?oh=e415acea31358ef5c49ac88c24dbbf4e&oe=58E23EA8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14034872_10210504781875626_1792416620732539543_n.jpg?oh=de92fc01e0a13c38a82446cd5da5767b&oe=5921BEA5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210504781875626&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-17T11:15:50+0000	1471432550	2016-08-17 13:15:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited the store shortly before 12 pm with my 15-year-old step son to purchase myself one bottle of beer. After a short period of deliberation  I opted for a bottle of Franziskaner Hefe Weissbier but whilst attempting to pay for the item  the cashier informed me that he would need to see Identification for both myself and my step son.  I am 34 and always carry my driving license so showing identification for myself is not a problem. However  my step son does not have identification to show that he is 18 as he is only 15  and given that the single bottle of beer I was attempting to purchase was for myself I would have anticipated that his age was irrelevant.  I asked to speak to a Team Leader  who attempted to explain that it was company policy. I asked for clarity as to the age he would be regarded as young enough to not have to show ID  for example if he had been 13 instead of 15 would the same situation arise. Understandably  neither member of staff could answer this question given the policy there were following was clearly not in place for these circumstances.  I had anticipated that common sense would perhaps prevail however it seemingly became a situation of “computer says no”  and both the cashier and Team Leader explained that in order for a 34-year-old with sufficient ID to purchase alcohol  a 15-year-old who was not attempting to purchase alcohol would need to prove that they were older than they were.  This is not the first time I have attempted to purchase alcohol in the presence of my step son  however it was the first time I was refused at point of sale. Whilst I fully appreciate the importance of ensuring age regulated purchases are carefully monitored  I would like to think that Tesco would agree that it is not acceptable for parents to leave their dependants outside a store every time they attempt to such a product.  I would very much appreciate your feedback on this matter.  Neil Bontoft					2016-08-17T09:47:49+0000	1471427269	2016-08-17 11:47:49	5	13	5	0	18	9	3	6	4	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

She s had a little girl. Much to my disappointment  all of your  it s a girl  card was pink! Every single one out of around 20 different ones! Come on Tesco  surely we re way beyond the days of pink for girls and blue for boys?! What about baby cards that are yellow  or cream  or white  or any other colour in the spectrum that is not pink?!					2016-08-17T09:34:36+0000	1471426476	2016-08-17 11:34:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.					2016-08-17T09:30:57+0000	1471426257	2016-08-17 11:30:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well it isn t for me as I had approximately two hours sleep last night & now have a day of work to get through. I would like to know why you had construction/decoration work carried out to the fascia of your Bristol  Church Road store throughout the early hours of the morning yesterday? The work started before 11pm and finished at 4am in the morning. The worst of the noise was between 11pm & 02:30am approx?! I ended up calling the Police (on 101) as the noise from the pressure washer device sounded more like a pneumatic drill but was told as it was commercial & not residential there was nothing they could do. I can only assume that the work was carried out at this time so it wouldn t affect your trade & just affect the sleep of any residents that live nearby said store. Any feedback would be much appreciated.					2016-08-17T08:18:55+0000	1471421935	2016-08-17 10:18:55	0	13	0	0	13	13	1	12	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge to follow in the great footsteps of the co-op & superdrug  and the improved Sainsburys & M&S and request you label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans. There are over 500 000 vegans in the UK and that figure is on the rise. It s so refreshing to see stores like the co-op and superdrug take veganism and cruelty free shopping so seriously.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-0/s130x130/13932840_10154436407289108_343234606448866879_n.jpg?oh=aed3cb5665f53bea7aa9fb97bd068cae&oe=58D92B24	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-9/13932840_10154436407289108_343234606448866879_n.jpg?oh=7c455cfd6f5060059df6373c329aed8a&oe=58EE4F9E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154436407289108&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-17T07:42:42+0000	1471419762	2016-08-17 09:42:42	4	0	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Previously when I had a late evening order I was able to amend it up until 12.45pm on the day of delivery. I logged in this morning to add a few items to tonight s order and was unable to. Admittedly when I look back at the confirmation email it does say it can only be amended until 00.15 but unfortunately I didn t read the small print as I ve always previously been able to make changes on the day.

I placed an order in June which I spent all day at home waiting for but didn t arrive due to a system error! you gave me a voucher to apologize which i tried to use yesterday. However when I checked out my shopping ( to receive it today) I received a confirmation email which detailed my previous shopping ordered in June. When I contacted your customer service. I was told they had heard of this glitch and that no order was placed. So yet again I have ended up with no shopping. There was no offer to try and arrange a prompt delivery of shopping and resolve the problem I was just told I would have to order it for later in the week. Absolutely shocking customer service which has left me feeling frustrated and upset. I will now be off to battle round the supermarket with two preschoolers thank you tesco. I am very worried that money will be taken from my account as I was reassured when I placed the order in June it would not however money left my account and then returned later.					2016-08-17T06:28:07+0000	1471415287	2016-08-17 08:28:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was out at the time so missed her but thankfully she came back an hour later as I was  assessing the damage  (read on my hands and knees crying in the road  it was my bosses car that I d borrowed!).

You don t know how to treat your costumers.  I placed an order trough the website and it was supposed to arrive between 8-9 pm. It was 9:45  no one called  I didn t have the order (but of course Tesco had charged me already for the order) and I called Tesco to see what happened. The first girl I talked with told me that the drivers couldn t come because they ran out of time (WHICH IS NOT MY PROBLEM) and the cancelled my order WITHOUT ASKING me. And then she said that she can reschedule the order but then I will be charge another time for the same order before the refund will be processed. I told her that it s not acceptable that nobody called me about my order and then I m gonna be charged two times in my bank account before having the order and because of them I m gonna be in negatives in my bank account. I asked for some compensation and she told me she can t do that. She passed me with her supervisor and the same old story: poor drivers that they dind t have time  my order is cancelled and I can wait 5 DAYS to have my order again so the refund will be processed. So I will be with no food (food that I needed TODAY that s why I payed for the delivery charge)in negative numbers in my bank account and paying the bank s fee because of Tesco s fault and the only thing she can offer me (because I ask for  she wasn t offering ANYTHING) is 10 pounds voucher as  a gesture . A gesture. You didn t deliver my food  you didn t give me any notice  you dind t ask me if I wanted to canceled the order  I m gonna have problems with my bank  and I don t know when I m gonna have the food I needed for today  but  hey  have 10 pounds which is NOTHING for a big company like us as agesture. Like she was making me a favor. I wasn t happy and then she offered me 20 pounds and she couldn t do anything else for me. No way.  It s insane. I feel so mistreated I m not gonna place an order trough Tesco again in my life. I ve never had problems with other supermarkets. Good luck treating the costumers like that and not caring if you lose a costumer. And I will put what happened to me in every single website I find so everyone knows how you work and they cand spend their money in a better place.					2016-08-16T21:33:41+0000	1471383221	2016-08-16 23:33:41	2	6	2	0	8	6	2	4	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I had no choice but to brave the aisles with my tired  stroppy  bored 7 year old daughter and her teething  tired  not 100% well 17 month old brother. It wasn t going too well with my son shouting  nar na  (as he saw them) my daughter saying can I have this and me trying to remember what I had written on the list that I obviously left at home. A lovely member of staff  Nessy  said  would they like a banana? I can fetch them one  initially I said no they will be fine thank you. Nessy then told me that tesco are trying to encourage children to eat their 5 a day and there is fruit at the store entrance which I clearly missed. I was very pleasantly surprised. Nessy then came back to me with 2 bananas. My children were thrilled to bits my son in his element showing his banana to everyone and shouting  nar na  with a mouth full!! I d just like to say a huge THANK YOU to Nessy from Hucknall Tesco Extra for saving my shopping trip from becoming a complete disaster 🙌🏻 Nessy is a lovely lady and a asset to your team. I hope she gets to find out how much she helped me today. 👍🏻					2016-08-16T20:31:35+0000	1471379495	2016-08-16 22:31:35	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.					2016-08-16T19:51:05+0000	1471377065	2016-08-16 21:51:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I got my chicken out of the fridge and started cooking at 6pm  I was disgusted to find that the chicken stank terribly of fish and gone off meat .

Ordered a Laz-y-Spa on 27/07 for my wife s birthday. Arranged delivery for the 06/08.....it didn t arrive. I re-booked delivery for Friday the 12/08  was told the courier would text me the delivery time the day before. I never received a text  so I contacted Tesco to find out why.....who contacted the courier & couldn t explain. Re-booked delivery for 17/08.....again told I would receive a text today  you guessed it...no text. So lunch time today I contacted Tesco  who informed me I would receive a text later today.....no text. So I called yet again  asking for the courier  ArrowXL to contact me directly......I was never contacted. So I called them myself  who informed me that my order was scheduled for tomorrow......but it was also marked as delivered.....REALLY?!?? They also informed me that due to an IT issue  they do not know if I would receive it!! So  I re-contacted Tesco.....where the nice young lady informed me that it is her day off tomorrow so would have to leave a note!! So I have cancelled the order due to a staggering level of incompetence.....however I won t receive my refund for another 5 days  thanks for that.....I will now be ordering from another supplier & will never use Tesco Direct again. I also have a very disappointed wife. Please feel free to investigate Tesco  my order ref is: 4BXFYDF3Y.					2016-08-16T19:47:47+0000	1471376867	2016-08-16 21:47:47	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There are lots of items marked  suitable for vegetarians   but many of us have gone that step forward to a crueltly-free life-style and have become vegan.

I parked in the parent and child space and thought that it would be easy enough to transfer the twins from car to trolley but this wasn t the case.  I searched for a twin seat and could only find the baby versions. I was just about to drive off when I spotted a member of staff. I asked if he had any available but he couldn t find one either! We looked through the trolley bay and came across one hidden behind about 20 trolleys.  It would be very helpful in the future for parents of young children/ twins if you could have them parked up and ready to use rather than having to look hard for one. Maybe having a row of twin seated trolleys on there own rather than mixing them up with single seated ones would help?? I hope my feedback will be past on to your stores and benefit other parents in the future					2016-08-16T18:30:13+0000	1471372213	2016-08-16 20:30:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.					2016-08-16T18:13:53+0000	1471371233	2016-08-16 20:13:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.					2016-08-16T16:34:03+0000	1471365243	2016-08-16 18:34:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When we got to the check out he began to scream... he has learning difficulties and a severe speech delay  so as much as I asked what was wrong and gave him options I was unable to figure out what was wrong with him.  As you can imagine it s frustrating for both of us and makes me anxious of what people s opinions of us are when he is screaming and I m unable to make him stop.  I finished loading my shopping and the cashier asked me what he wanted. I explained I didnt know. She asked if he wanted to help. I asked him if he wanted to pack the shopping and gave him the bag  the lady scanned the first item and passed it to him as I held the bag open. He then stopped crying!!!  She did this with a few items then I said to her it would take all afternoon to let him do it all and laughed (secretly worrying what his reaction would be when I took over packing).  She went on to tell me not to worry how long it took and to let him do it!! I was shocked!! With this my little boy was happy and the cashier and I were able to have a little chat while he happily packed the shopping.  So Maureen on checkout 17 just before 4pm.. thank you! (I am told her surname is Anderson)  You not only helped me calm my little boy  but you helped me have confidence that not everyone is of the opinion that a screaming child is a naughty one!  You gave a child the time he needed to make his Tesco experience a great one. Something so seemingly small can mean so much to some people ❤					2016-08-16T16:31:14+0000	1471365074	2016-08-16 18:31:14	7392	402	8191	698	9291	397	320	77	737	0	7330	758	28	4	1	1	0

On Monday morning my daughter looked in my fridge and said  when did you get these. I said last night why  she said I pk has 28th July the other pk is 26th August. I phoned tesco straight away who said they will exchange the out of date pk  and apologised. I told them I wasn t happy because I d have to make a special journey back (I live about 2 to 3 miles away)  couldn t go on Monday so went today. The duty manager did exchange them but I wasn t happy because 1)he didn t seem to concerned  even though they were over 2 wks out of date  2)all he said was I was told by a member of staff you were coming into exchange them because they were out of date  he didn t apologise just said I can t believe it  they must have been right at the back  3)I would have thought he d offered me something in the way of compensation  expecially when I pointed out that the store could have been in serious trouble had I have reported it to health and safety or head office. My grandson is 5 yrs old and the grandaughter is almost a yr old  if my daughter hadn t have realised they were out of date I would have given them  I dread to think how ill they would have been! I have recently come back from holiday and know I didn t have any left before I went as my daughter cleaned my fridge out just after I went away. This is not the first time I ve had things that have been out of date from tesco s but it s usually a day or 2 not almost 3 wks. Please can you train all your staff how important it is to do date checking and stock rotation  then I wouldn t have to keep putting my reading glasses on to look at the dates on everything!!!					2016-08-16T15:50:05+0000	1471362605	2016-08-16 17:50:05	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As such  I am glad to see that Tesco is stocking an ever-wider range of specialist vegan products  and labelling them for easy identification. Having access to a range of clearly marked vegan products in supermarkets makes life much easier for me and other vegans. However  I notice that you have many more own-brand goods that appear to contain no animal products and yet are not labelled as being suitable for vegans. This inconsistent approach forces me to laboriously check every ingredient in all of your unlabelled products to see which ones are suitable for me. Using the list of vegan products on your website is also impractical because  at 44-pages long  it is much too large to carry with me and it takes too long to find the right item. I strongly urge you to print the Tesco ‘vegetarian & vegan’ logo on the packaging of ALL of your animal-free and cruelty-free products to avoid confusion and make shopping in your stores easier and more appealing for vegan customers.

It annoys me most of the time when blind  normal  members of the public park in the parent and child spaces when they don t have children but for one of your own members of staff to do it is just a bloody cheek!! Especially when they were challenged by my husband who asked if they d forgotten their child  she just responded saying that it was OK as she worked there!!

The one bought from Apple was replaced with a brand new phone within 90 minutes. However the other bought from Tesco is a very different matter. They have offered to send it away for 10  days for an attempt at repair before a possible replacement with a reconditioned model if unable to do so. Obviously this is a complete waste of their time and effort as I will not be without a phone for 10 days so am off to  guess where .....to buy a replacement. Yes  Apple of course.  Moral . Don t buy a mobile phone from Tesco s or you might find yourself without one for 10 days.  Obviously I have let Tesco Customer Services know about their lack of service and will let you know the outcome. Watch this space  and please share let as many  Poor  unsuspecting customers as possible know. 🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁					2016-08-16T14:53:54+0000	1471359234	2016-08-16 16:53:54	0	10	0	0	10	10	1	9	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yet at Tesco I have to spend much time looking carefully at lists of ingredients (and am often dismayed that there are many products which could easily be vegan but for a small amount of dairy or eggs  easily replaceable with plant-based substitutes).

As such  I am glad to see that Tesco is stocking an ever-wider range of specialist vegan products  and labelling them for easy identification. Having access to a range of clearly marked Vegan products in supermarkets makes life much easier for me and other Vegans.  However  I notice that you have many more own-brand goods that appear to contain no animal products and yet are not labelled as being suitable for Vegans. This inconsistent approach forces me to laboriously check every ingredient in all of your unlabelled products to see which ones are suitable for me. Using the list of Vegan products on your website is also impractical because  at 44-pages long  it is much too large to carry with me and it takes too long to find the right item.  I strongly urge you to print the Tesco ‘Vegetarian & Vegan’ logo on the packaging of ALL of your Animal-free and cruelty-free products to avoid confusion and make shopping in your stores easier and more appealing for Vegan customers.					2016-08-16T12:27:26+0000	1471350446	2016-08-16 14:27:26	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our household consumes a fair amount of Yorkshire Tea and normally buys the super dooper big box. However I always buy a small box each time a new Yorkshire Tea tin is released. Over the years we have collected quite a few and each new one replaces the former to become the tea caddy. My previous tin  (Yorkshire Gold on the right ) is looking rather shabby and in need of replacing. Now  being a Yorkshire lass stranded in Geordie land there is only one caddy I would consider to house my precious brew. Seeing that Tesco had a free Gruffulo tin with the 80 tea bag box it seemed a wise choice so I added it to my online shop.  Excited for delivery of my new caddy today I was disappointed to find that my Gruffulo tin had either dismounted the box of tea en-route or was masquerading as a cardboard box. Whilst the packaging of Yorkshire Tea is most appealing I doubt it will withstand daily use as protector of the golden brew of God s own country. Will I ever see my favoured tin or will I be shamed by using my shoddy tin forevermore?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13924912_10208666503954522_8784439651318566770_n.jpg?oh=a811cd9e5b237a121d7f46afe307f9b8&oe=591CE475	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13924912_10208666503954522_8784439651318566770_n.jpg?oh=0329bfeb6cdb7d04a5908bf5c58ee4b1&oe=58DF8678	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208666503954522&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-16T09:28:31+0000	1471339711	2016-08-16 11:28:31	4	2	4	1	7	2	1	1	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

As always I needed to pick a few bits up in store before collecting my order. On coming back to my car I had a flat tyre! (A very flat tyre) whilst waiting for the AA I walked over to the click and collect and asked the lady if it was possible for me to walk my shopping over to my car when they were a little less busy (they had a few cars queueing) she said this was fine and to Coke back when I was ready!   I was with my mum who waited by my car whilst I walked to the local tyre shop  when I returned to my surprise the lady had found my car and brought my shopping over and helped my mum put my shopping in my car! This was a lovely thing to do and not something that a lot of people would do! I didn t catch the ladies name but I would like to say thank you to her!  In the same trip when the gentleman who is the car park and trolley assistant realised I had a flat tyre  he came over and tried his best to help but looking at the tyre and even offer wig to help if I needed it! Again I didn t catch his name but would like to say thank you!   You have 2 very helpful members of staff there who went beyond what I would think would be their duties!					2016-08-16T05:20:16+0000	1471324816	2016-08-16 07:20:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a pack of Bounty cookies and loved them. I enjoyed them so much I bought another pack a few days later and thought it was my lucky day as there were 5 cookies in my pack. I gave the first cookie(an actual Bounty one) away to Charlotte which she also loved. I then bit into a cookie only to find it wasn t a Bounty cookie but a raisin and cinnamon one 😖. The other 3 were also raisin and cinnamon. Proper ruined my morning it did as I hate cinnamon much to the amusement of Charlotte! I m still a bit annoyed about it now two days on!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13934828_10153950680463931_2090680706139030468_n.jpg?oh=97c3ba648319cfef38202a4d19ca8f1d&oe=58D85B72	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13934828_10153950680463931_2090680706139030468_n.jpg?oh=8ef25c155e5d4c618dc62e51ec9a5372&oe=5919067F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153950680463931&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-15T23:04:01+0000	1471302241	2016-08-16 01:04:01	23	29	34	0	63	26	7	19	17	0	22	0	1	7	1	2	0

On Sunday my daughter and I visited the Highwoods Colchester store and were invited to take part in an egg and spoon race.  Needless to say that my little girl loved it and much fun was had!!!   The fact that she was allowed to keep the Kinder egg was brilliant.  I just wanted to say thank you to the team who made shopping a lot more fun than normal.

Her name is Jane and I think her badge said she is the checkout supervisor.  Whilst I was shopping Saturday morning with my baby daughter she unfortunately had an accident at the checkout we had just arrived out. Needless to say it wasn t the most pleasant of sights and it turns out she has had a rather bad tummy bug for the last 3 days. Anyway Jane came straight to our aid. Didn t make a big deal out of it at all. She allowed me to take some baby wipes from the shop floor and pay for them when I was done. Whilst I took my little girl to change and clean her up she cleared up the mess  got rid of the ruined food in our trolley and replaced it with new ones and opened up the checkout herself to scan my items through.  My massive thank you for her discretion throughout the whole time and making me feel like it was no inconvenience and once cleaned up treated us like it had never happened.  Some lovely people in this world					2016-08-15T20:58:25+0000	1471294705	2016-08-15 22:58:25	122	7	125	0	132	6	5	1	4	0	122	3	0	0	0	0	0

Every single time I buy a few items of clothing there is always at least one item that still has a security tag on it.  I can appreciate that along with customer service  security is also very important. However today s purchase consisted of a 3 pack of girls wool tights 7-8 and a 2 pack of bog standard girls leggings also 7-8 and like every other time the alarms don t go off leaving the store. So tonight getting my daughters things ready for school and what a surprise security tags on both items under a fiver  really Tesco?. Are children s tights and leggings that popular to steal in Westhill they need security tagged??. My husband has been stopped before at the same store because the alarm had gone off when leaving.  I m quite relieved to say there was nothing in his bag with security tags still attached which is really lucky however it did come to light it was in actual fact a tag in the pocket of the combat trousers i bought him a week earlier for work.   Please sort this out Tesco it s getting silly  thank you x					2016-08-15T20:56:06+0000	1471294566	2016-08-15 22:56:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t like food shopping with my kids (2&4yr old). I once vowed never to take them to supermarket again  after I shamelessly cried on a cashier  after a dear customer told my child to  shut-up  when singing  3 little monkeys ... 🐵🙈🙉 It was a low moment!   However means must  and I took them to my local Tesco branch last week...  They were given stickers & free fruit  an apple... I did my food shop... We sung songs about apples  cows and milk - we left - we were all happy... They ate apples. They want to go back to Tesco for the fruit basket  I want to go back to Tesco. I think I now like food shopping with my kids... I m a changed woman  all because of an apple and some stickers 🍏 Thank You Tesco - that idea was good. Very good.

The queues were really long to get into the ground and of course  I needed the loo! Opposite the racecourse was Tesco. I popped over but it was after 4pm and being Sunday was closing.  I spoke to the security guard and asked if the petrol station had a loo but it didn t.  I don t know this gentleman s name but he was so lovely and let my friend and I in.  Well done Tesco  your guy on the door was a true gent and I ve now been converted to shop at my local store.

She was very pleasant and was really friendly to my very very tired and feed up kids (one of which pretty cried through the whole transaction and the other asked for some sweets around 50 times) she could of easily of just served me and ignored them both but she engaged in conversation with them both.   Also the pharmacist who was working around 6.30-7ish (didn t get his name) was also very friendly to both of my children  They just made a stressful shopping trip just a little bit less stressful   X					2016-08-15T19:53:50+0000	1471290830	2016-08-15 21:53:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Will I need to bring the fruit too or will this photo and my receipt be enough?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14022321_10154342840841153_2909468013076140836_n.jpg?oh=f0c3fa5dbabd1b993378a3ab7480fbaa&oe=58DB6404	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14022321_10154342840841153_2909468013076140836_n.jpg?oh=920262ed3098b95a7196eec77c49cd3c&oe=58ECA009	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154342840841153&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-15T19:46:43+0000	1471290403	2016-08-15 21:46:43	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am fed up with taking a trolley that has half eaten fruit in the bottom!  I am also disgusted to see fruit just thrown on the ground in the trolley parks when there are bins right next to them  It s a really good idea to give out the free fruit so the least we can do is dispose of it properly. I know shopping with little ones is stressful but please think about the example you are giving your child when you just leave it for someone else to clean up  and before you decide that I am obviously just a moaner with no children I am a grandparent who usually has a two year old with her so I am not just stressed when I am shopping I am old as well!

(though I totally think you should get Cherry pop tarts at the Lynn Tesco on Hardwick cause They never have them)  You even stated carrying Kraft Mac and cheese which is one of my favorite food ever.  I also recently discovered your chilled Chicken Bacon pasta Back.  And it is so good Perfect amount of sauce chicken and bacon!  I was shopping today and got all my favorites but some unhappy happened.  I m not very smart so maybe it was my fault but I m pretty sure it wasn t. I was in the check out line and talking with the nice lady ringing me up ( a collage student who said she s studying for a masters in a new doctors field which is super col she must be very very smart! :)   She was being very nice tome and today was a rare occasion where I was having a god day.  See I m autistic so sometimes I have a really really hard time.  Tesco staff is always really nice to me  and super friendly.  so because I was having a good day we where talking while she scanned my shopping and I packed it.  but at some point (I m not sure when) another customer joined the que (I d like to not that there where other lines  she had less then the limit for the express lane and a lot of the self check out points where open)  Anyway while I was talking this customer Yelled at me.  just right out of no where. Some of my stuff wasn t even done being scanned yet!  I can t move any faster but she treated me like some how her being in a hurry was my fault.  It really upset me.  now this isn t your fault at all Like I said your employees are always super nice. But the lady ringing me up didn t say anything.    I don t know if store policee keeps her from defending customers  but I m worried that maybe I messed up somehow  I don t want to be annoying but I know on my good days  because their not often  I can get enthusiastic  so maybe she was annoyed with me to  but couldn t say so because I m a customer?  I don t know  I m not good with social cues and It seemed to me that our conversation was going very well. but Maybe I did something wrong?  But I don t know what.  and so I ve been really worried that Maybe the reason The lady at the till didn t say anything was because she agreed with the mean lady and was mad at me  but couldn t say so cause of her job?  Um so I was wondering if you could apologize to the cashier for me.  I dunno what her name was she was very nice  she works at the Tesco Hardwick round about in Kings Lynn Norfolk and it was today 8/15/2016 um at around 1:30 2 o clock I think?  I didn t have a watch with me sorry.  Um  But if you could tell her I m sorry if I bothered her I d appreciate it.    Like I said I know that because I m not good with social things i don t always know if I m bothering someone  and she was very nice to me so I don t want to think I was bothering her.  I hope yu can tell her I m sorry.  I couldn t because after the lady yelled I got upset and didn t want to breakdown in the shop so I just paid and left and cried when I got to my momma at the ca. so Please. I d really appreciate it if you could get my message to her.  Thank you very very much.

It s in Tesco s and Argos. Argos are currently selling it for cheaper  however you can only get it home delivered which then makes it around the same price as the one in Tesco s. So because I was ordering other bits from Tesco s I thought  I ll pay the extra pick it all up together and save the stress. Thus bringing me to my first problem. My order got split.  That s fine I can deal with that. So I walk up there (30 min walk each way - or pay parking) weathers nice so may as well. Pick up my first part. All good. Second issue... my second order was supposed to arrive in store for pick up on Friday 12th but it didn t arrive until Monday 15th. Again  not major  I can just walk back up the shop with baby and dog in tow. Collect my goods great woo. Drama over...not. Got my packet home and completely different to what I ordered...see picture. Left is what I ordered and right is what I got...Definitely not the same. Left with a heart broken toddler and now I have to waste my time and effort to sort it all out 😠. Sort it out Tesco s!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13925049_10153995746214862_2403592347184307159_n.jpg?oh=5a6eba57f3239833239813c3f7c5a3d9&oe=5920EB65	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13925049_10153995746214862_2403592347184307159_n.jpg?oh=b372046c9b407e6d3523036511c0d907&oe=58DF0168	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153995746214862&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-15T16:04:16+0000	1471277056	2016-08-15 18:04:16	1	3	3	0	6	3	3	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0

A couple of occasions I also spotted the owner was stood outside of said van wearing her Tesco uniform proudly with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth. I think its great that you allow your employees to take up these larger  parent and child  spaces especially those with small vans that don t seem to be able to find the several hundred normal sized parking spaces. For mums like me struggling to put my pram up whilst dealing with a screaming baby I really appreciate these parent and child parking spaces however it has been confusing me- are these staff only now? Perhaps you need to change the sign. I have pointed this out to staff at the store and also emailed head office who I got a lovely reply from. The van disappeared for a couple of weeks after my email reply but its now back! I just wanted to apologise now that if i am racing past with my daughter in her pram whilst she is screaming after doing a poo bomb that if a explosive dirty nappy ends up on the windscreen of this van it is purely by accident. Give my regards to this member of staff I think she deserves employee of the month!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/s130x130/13920921_10155122077797785_2578174404363584314_n.jpg?oh=35e4bbf519edf0fb37e7b07e86b5e10f&oe=5922BAD1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q86/s720x720/13920921_10155122077797785_2578174404363584314_n.jpg?oh=3a4ced096595de47a7a0ff5211e06623&oe=58E50A0C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155122077797785&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-15T14:52:50+0000	1471272770	2016-08-15 16:52:50	22	11	31	2	44	9	7	2	2	0	21	2	0	6	0	1	0

Pushing my trolley across the car park a box of 12 eggs slipped off my trolley and broke on the floor. Took them to customer service to get rid of them and got offered another box in replacement!

The young man that delivered my mums shopping today was made aware by a neighbour that my mum  had had a fall. He smiled & helped her with the shopping. Great customer service. Van number  6T/1276. Ng11 area. Delivery between 1-2pm. Please pass on our gratitude Tesco.

Enough parking spaces under the building so why are designers not more adventurous and family friendlier?

My bananas are ripening to grey! I have read it can disrupt the proper ripening process  but even if this isn t so  we eat with our eyes as they say and grey bananas don t look very appetising at all! Especially important when trying to encourage my kids to eat fruit. (Actually  as a  grown up  who isn t a big fan of  nanas  it s a handy excuse for mommy to skip her banana a day  too 😉).  I understand transporting them must be quite a logistical game but I have noticed this greying more recently.

Is it possible that a company like Tesco deals with delivery companies like Arrow XL which are unable to give correct information and  not only that  but also tell lies? I have been waiting for the delivery of my wardrobes for over 1 month and a half. Been regularly given the wrong information  been told a date and then delivery not even going out of the depot. Been told that I was contacted when it never happened (by Arrow). Dealing now with 2 managers at Tesco customer service team: David Petrey and Lorraine Craig  still not getting anywhere. This matter need to be dealt at higher level as this is not the service any decent company gives to customers. I need my wardrobes ASAP  I want to file a formal complaint but nobody is listening  so turning to Facebook   I need somebody to listen and take the matter in hands!					2016-08-15T09:50:57+0000	1471254657	2016-08-15 11:50:57	1	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Many people do it by inspiring fear in the hearts of others. It takes a really good person to engage with the hearts of others  crack a joke  and plant the seeds of humor and goodwill in others. Tesco PR being a sensation for breaking down barriers between strangers  and inspiring smiles is admirable to say the least.

Anyone else notice the significant increase in price of embroidered school uniform items? It wouldn t be so bad if you could actually order everything you needed in one go. To add insult to injury when you go back on to eventually find certain  items are back in stock you have to pay a further £3 delivery.  Tesco I would have happily have ordered everything at once if you could actually supply it.  Now I find myself without basics for the start of the school year and paying twice the delivery charges.

Amazing service.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14034732_10157317929160578_6893372945469774606_n.jpg?oh=71502051325f44d29774ec92acabdf04&oe=591CDC7E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14034732_10157317929160578_6893372945469774606_n.jpg?oh=a5bc2aaeb2319b9b427e4abe28c0ccd5&oe=58D8CC73	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157317929160578&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-14T19:43:53+0000	1471203833	2016-08-14 21:43:53	2	3	5	0	8	3	2	1	0	0	2	3	0	0	0	0	0

You ve asked for the product number etc which I gave you but still no reply it s been almost two weeks and all of emails are being ignored. Maybe this will help with your  investigation  that you have promised.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/14029720_10210059391505127_412673775_n.jpg?oh=69145cfb2b5351f65cc3a812df742b91&oe=58DE203E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/14029720_10210059391505127_412673775_n.jpg?oh=039a2a696fb824c509dfb22065bd1530&oe=5923606A	https://www.facebook.com/10208992422311564/videos/10210059387705032	facebook.com	2016-08-14T19:42:41+0000	1471203761	2016-08-14 21:42:41	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I LOVE the Tesco salad bar :) However  the labeling of each salad is always a problem. I need to know what is in the salads - today in Berkhamsted there was a lovely looking rice dish wrongly labelled as  sweetcorn .  When I asked the staff what was in the rice salad nobody was able to find out :(  Also. the labels are tiny and I see people lowering their heads into to salads trying to read the tiny text which is BEHIND the saladbowls. Can the labels be in front of the bowls?  Today I bought what was labelled as  falafal  but turned out to be onion bhaji. Not a problem for me  but it shows that the items don t match the listing.  Is there a website link showing the salad bar items and the ingredients? I want to buy but I can t if I don t know what I m eating! Please pass this on.  thank you x					2016-08-14T19:07:03+0000	1471201623	2016-08-14 21:07:03	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I messaged the customer services team late last night to ask for some assistance  through the night they kept me updated and nothing was too much trouble for the team (even at 03.30 this morning!!)even though we were warned the release of the tickets may take 24 hours we had the emails by 10am this morning.... Enabling us to have a wonderful family day at Wicksteed Park.

I just cooked up one of your own brand  Fully Loaded Nacho Chicken  pizzas...  That was not chicken. That was  Nacho Fish.  I don t mind  because despite my lifelong belief that fish doesn t belong on pizza  it was actually pretty good  the kids didn t seem to notice or care  and I am so beyond bored with chicken it drives me mad. I m not out for a refund or anything  we definitely ate the whole thing  I do have the packaging for now if you want to track down the source of the problem  as my only concern would be if someone ate it with a fish allergy  they clearly wouldn t be expecting a trip to hospital from a  chicken  pizza.					2016-08-14T16:43:19+0000	1471192999	2016-08-14 18:43:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I pulled in at 15.40 to get the few bits I needed (only came to £10 to give you an idea). There wasn t a single parent and child bay available (I m a single parent of a toddler and a 16 week all baby). I appreciate this happens  so I park in a normal bay and walk my toddler across the carpark and carry baby over to get a trolley. In all 3 of your trolley bays there isn t a single infant and toddler trolley  so I end struggling to manoeuvre my toddler into a trolley and carry the baby  pushing the trolley with my remaining arm. No raspberries  so I settle for strawberries. I get to the diary aisle and my baby throws up all over herself and the aisle. I inform the lady on the deli counter as I don t want people to slip. And she sighs and says she ll go get a bucket  no particular concern about her welfare (I appreciate that s not her job but  you know). I don t have enough time to change her before closing so I continue to get my items and go to the checkout  to find one of my yogurts had split. Your checkout lady was really lovely and packed my bag for me as she could see I was struggling. I then take the trolley back to the car and unload the children. I take the trolley back to one of your little huts rather than abandoning it like I often see  but as I get there the wheel locks up. Your trolley man comes up behind me and says that it s okay and he ll get it. So I head back to my car so I can get my vomit covered baby home and changed to have your trolley man call after me saying  well you ve broken the wheel . I appreciate it s nearly 4pm and people want to get home  and each one of these incidents on its own is okay  but in combination all of these little things have caused me to come home feeling very deflated about my shopping experience and some of your staff members today.					2016-08-14T15:39:11+0000	1471189151	2016-08-14 17:39:11	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

I have no issue with the staff working there they are all lovely and polite.  However on my departure I went to reverse and saw the tesco delivery truck coming so I pulled back into the designated car  parking space for tesco next to the bank and sat patiently with my reverse light on. whilst the lorry adjusted parking 3 times. He then blocked me in. I politely waited and after nearly 10 minutes I had enough and went to look for the delivery driver I looked quite cross but said nothing he then stared over at me and with no apology and yelled at me you can communicate with me ! So he clearly realised he blocked me in. After that I then replied you saw me try to reverse I sat there patiently with my reverse light on then you proceded to block me in. even if he wasnt clearly werent looking at his surroundings safely which isnt a good sign if you cant see someone trying to reverse and  someone sat with a reverse light waiting to get out. That is really bad driving.  why would you clearly block a customer in a parking space . You then with ease reversed it back a couple of meters after me saying something to let me out. And to unblock the car park. As you first arrived I got out of the car to look and there were no other cars behind the lorry so why did he just not do this in the first place. So 2 things I am not happy with him blocking a car in a designated car park and his then attitude towards me yelling at me after realising his fault with no apology. I also had a screaming baby in the back who had been waiting for 10 minutes for me to get home for her milk thats also why I couldn t keep getting out the car to look for him as I was trying to comfort the baby. Im not happy !					2016-08-14T14:50:08+0000	1471186208	2016-08-14 16:50:08	3	11	6	0	17	11	4	7	4	0	3	0	0	0	1	2	0

Now I dread walking in to you shops because they are not accessible for me.  I almost always now get the wrong thing because the people i m asking to help me do not understand what I am saying.   This is  I have come to realise  as a direct result of the language barrier.  They do not understand the actual words being spoken.  Also there is the impatience.  While trying to communicate in a way they can understand so that I can get the right things on my list they simply agree with whatever I say and then bring a version of what I ask for and tell me that it is (put in here an exact repetition of the words I used)   It hasn t just happened to me in 1 or even two of your stores.  Is it too much to ask for at least some basic English proficiency in your staff? It is not your buildings that are in danger of becoming truly inaccessible now Tesco  it s your staff.					2016-08-14T13:05:11+0000	1471179911	2016-08-14 15:05:11	1	5	3	0	8	5	1	4	1	0	1	0	0	0	2	0	0

I have just wasted two and a half hours waiting for my car to get the gold wash/valet. I left my car at 10.45 and was told to come back in two hours  which is what my receipt said. I arrived back at 1pm  giving them a few mins extra to compete the job. My car HADN T BEEN TOUCHED.   It was a bit difficult to understand what the three men were trying to tell me (perhaps at least one member of staff should speak English)  but it was along the lines of they have been busy and it will only be another 20 minutes. So perhaps you could explain how cars that that WERE NOT waiting at the same time as mine to be cleaned had been?   Two hours is a long time to wait  but I needed to do a little shop and thought I d treat myself to lunch in the cafe. No food from the kitchen as the chef hadn t turned up - again  apparently. Fortunately my coffee was good and the poor chap serving was very apologetic. It s not his fault.  Management - isn t that what you should be doing? Not leave it to the poor chap probably earning a pittance to deal with cheesed off public.  So  this was the last straw to many unhappy experiences at Tesco Cirencester.  Appalling service which sadly sums up the general apathetic manner in which most of your staff carry out their duties.   Waitrose and Aldi here I come. However  what I can never get back is the two hours I ve wasted today.   Yours  very unhappy customer.					2016-08-14T12:24:51+0000	1471177491	2016-08-14 14:24:51	4	3	4	0	7	3	1	2	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I d like to comment how great Delme is  he works at Tesco Extra Llantrisant in the click and collect Hut. We pick up our shopping every Sunday at the same time slot and not only has he remembered our name but is always friendly and polite. He checks our eggs  holds our crates to help us empty them into the car and always wishes us a good day. I hope this message gets to him along with some well deserved recognition.

We first reported the incident in store on the 2nd July and then having heard nothing from your customer service team (I asked for the incident to be investigated and then a letter from Tesco explaining the reason for the genital pube in the yoghurt) I raised this via Facebook.  As you can imagine we got an instant response  excellent I thought  we are getting somewhere.    The issue was reported via Facebook on the 27th July.  It is now the 14th August.  We have been away on holiday during that time and still no letter from Tesco when we got home.  A big disappointment.  Perhaps I was wrong and pubic hair is a key ingredient in your Tesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurts  if so would you please be kind enough to highlight this on the packaging so that the customer does not get a surprise when they find the pube located within the half eaten pot.  Happy if pubes are part of the manufacturing process  but as I said please can you make this clear on the packaging in the future so that we can avoid having to purchase any products that contain them.  It would be nice if somebody at Tesco could take this seriously as it is a major failure of your GMP processes to allow genital hairs into your products.  A hair from somebody’s head or face you can understand if something finds its way in a product by mistake  but not a genital hair.  Seriously though customer service should be your number one priority  without customers you are not able to function correctly.  One customer has a bad experience they tell 10 people  if they have a good one  they may tell one.  Basic customer service is not hard and an organisation like Tesco should have it down to a fine art.  Perhaps you have just got too big and you no longer care about the people who buy from your stores and pay for your wages.  Once again I look forward to hearing from you (maybe)  an apology would be nice and possibly an explanation about how it happened  how you intend on changing your procedure to hopefully stop it happening again  and also how it has taken you so long to send a letter.    You could have walked and hand delivered a letter by now.  Many thanks.  Kind regards   Paul					2016-08-14T09:21:15+0000	1471166475	2016-08-14 11:21:15	12	4	13	0	17	4	1	3	0	0	12	0	0	0	0	1	0

I ve just got my joint of pork out to put in the oven for our roast dinner today  and it s definitely smelling off - there s no escaping that rotten meat smell is there?! I bought this joint on the 9th   and it was dated the 10th. I froze it as soon as I got home and put it in the fridge to defrost last night ready to cook this morning. I do this all the time with short date meat and never have a problem.  So now I m stuck on a Sunday with no meat for a roast and nothing else here which could replace it. All my veg cleaned too !					2016-08-14T08:07:22+0000	1471162042	2016-08-14 10:07:22	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can understand it for groceries but to order your size in a garment?  Especially seen as I had to go to the store to order it as your website refuses to accept my postcode.  How does it cost £2 to put one garment behind the desk next time it s delivered?   Confused					2016-08-14T07:45:13+0000	1471160713	2016-08-14 09:45:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But I d also like to apologise for a) my daughter eating copious amounts of the fruit  and b) for my youngest that often chews a bit and throws it on your floor and whilst I do try my best to pick it all up in sure I miss bits. But more importantly I want to say thanks. Thanks to a young lady working in your Loughborough The Rushes store. A few weeks ago she served me and asked how I was  I explained that my youngest had just had a big operation and so we were all tired but relieved and just adjusting to life whilst she s in a big cast (being treated for hip Dysplasia so the cast is from her chest to both ankles). I left and thought she was kind and friendly but nothing else. However  this week whilst shopping again she happened to be serving us but I didn t even realise until she said  oh hi how lovely you ve brought your little one today how s she getting on with everything ? I was speechless. Instead of the usual stares and funny looks at her cast someone I didn t know was asking how she was! And she d remembered her and us as a family. I was really touched and it made me smile for the rest of the day. So thank you I have spoken to customer services at The Rushes store but I would equally appreciate you saying thank you/well done to the lady. I am determined to find her name and thank her personally too as I was so touched by her thoughtful comments at the time I completely forgot to check her name and say thank you. As you say  every little helps! And it really does x					2016-08-13T21:26:01+0000	1471123561	2016-08-13 23:26:01	14	4	14	0	18	4	2	2	0	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son was really upset when his car rolled under the shelves and Carl (in the fab shirt and shorts promoting Rio!) Came to see what the problem was when my son was crying. He spoke to my son Harry  reassuring him that they would get it back for him  and even involved him when he asked one of the other staff to bring a broom handle so they could retrieve it! As you can see they both stood watching for the man with the broom at the end of the aisle. He even asked Harry if he would do the important job of wearing his special hat for him while he got on the floor to get the car for him! Really excellent customer service  far beyond what is expected  and I m really grateful that he was so friendly and understanding  and involved my son to stop him from being upset! Wanted to make sure he gets acknowledged for his lovely actions. Thank you Carl  my son thinks you are great! 😁	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/s130x130/13934943_610186337395_4833847364646835727_n.jpg?oh=d49afc62809580b73385dab4aa030dee&oe=58DD8F11	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q83/s720x720/13934943_610186337395_4833847364646835727_n.jpg?oh=13ca7311433d600b2bb3a714b877d4fc&oe=5922283B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=610186337395&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-13T21:20:20+0000	1471123220	2016-08-13 23:20:20	1173	87	1231	47	1365	85	57	28	328	0	1157	47	7	1	0	0	0

Surely they are perfectly edible and not  unfit for human consumption  as stated on the bin bags.

I purchased a phone case that I later realised was the wrong size for my phone. I went straight back into the store with my receipt to return it. I was spoken to like I was stupid and didn t know anything. After being spoke down to and being told several times that they were refusing to refund me  they finally agreed to give me my money back. However  she made it seem like she was doing me a massive favour and that I should be extremely grateful. I will not be returning to this store if this is the way they treat their customers.					2016-08-13T20:30:35+0000	1471120235	2016-08-13 22:30:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I used your self service checkout no.72 and paid cash for my goods. I picked up my receipt and made my way to the exit. Your security guard stopped me on my way out and accused me of stealing over £100 of shopping. I was dragged through the store and treated atrociously by not only your security guards but your management too. None of them was willing to listen to me or check my goods against the receipt I had. I was publicly humiliated and was badgered by questioning of where I had hidden the stolen goods. I hadn t even left the store before your security had pulled me. I was detained by your staff for over 20mins before they realised that the person who had used the self service till before me was the one who had taken the goods without paying. I received no apology and was just told it s ok to leave now. I spend over £600 pound a month in your stores in Dumfries and Kirkcudbright. I can tell you now I have never been so embarrassed and humiliated in all my life. I certainly will never shop in your stores again.					2016-08-13T19:28:39+0000	1471116519	2016-08-13 21:28:39	11	43	34	9	86	40	29	11	10	0	11	0	11	0	0	12	0

We can t manage that but maybe you can pass this photo on? The chap in the car park doc the trollies was also worth a special mention   he was super! Thank you!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13932797_10157368243755201_5131432058219067954_n.jpg?oh=5c498d99ea3f55e8a04962a38012ebb5&oe=58EDA52F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13932797_10157368243755201_5131432058219067954_n.jpg?oh=c22257aad22fcfba25fb004f3333c1ec&oe=58E75822	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157368243755201&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-13T17:54:43+0000	1471110883	2016-08-13 19:54:43	23	1	26	0	27	1	1	0	0	0	23	3	0	0	0	0	0

Today as I pulled into your car park the baby filled it s nappy with his usual ferocity! I jumped out the car to find a completely flat tyre!! Richard noticed something was wrong (maybe it was the steam from my ears- or the smell of the nappy!) and came straight over. He was on the floor with me and changed my tyre  got covered in dirt. He saved the day on many levels... Not only did it mean I got me and my baby home safely that day - it also meant that the breakdown I d  forgotten I didn t have wasn t the huge costly issue that it could have been  meaning we can still go on our first little family holiday.  His act of kindness has truly meant so much.  Thanks Richard Pascoe!

Our cat was taken seriously ill suddenly and we had an urgent vets appointment arranged. This coincided with our delivery slot. The driver kindly agreed to redeliver after 4pm when we knew we would be home. Their kindness and assistance at a stressful time was much appreciated.					2016-08-13T17:31:31+0000	1471109491	2016-08-13 19:31:31	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I rang back they said they would  deliver at 6pm as I was going out at 12pm at 12.30pm they decided to deliver. My partner was just leaving. So he took it all in and phoned me to tell me some stuff was missing. I phoned again to be told someone would call me back  surprise surprise no one did. So I called again to be told  someone will bring the missing things at some point after 7pm  yeah every little helps... Not. Thanks tescos for completely messing up my day and all you can offer me is £6 delivery charge back 😂 what a joke!					2016-08-13T16:46:11+0000	1471106771	2016-08-13 18:46:11	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I went to get it out the fridge I have noticed it was out of date. Being nearly 9 months pregnant and craving this I am very disappointed not to mention how it could have made me ill. It was from the Boswell farm range too which are known to have a longer date on them so I dread to think how long it had been on shelf. I am unable to return it to the store until tomorrow or Monday but I do have the receipt so will that still be ok?					2016-08-13T16:45:05+0000	1471106705	2016-08-13 18:45:05	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had possibly just experienced one of my worst shopping trips ever and her kindness and understanding was overwhelming and massively appreciated.   Earlier on in the day I had taken my little boy Archie to out of hours gp with a severe case of tonsillitis. Needless to say he was not in the mood or health for a shopping trip. However a last minute nappy emergency saw me bundling Archie and his younger sister in the car and headed to your Northwich store.   I have learnt over the last few months not to take both of my children food shopping with me. Archie is nearly 3 and his sister is 18 months old (a mere 15 months between them). They fight and scrap and generally play up together in a trolley at the best of times  leaving me feeling stressed and with only half of what I originally came shopping for.   So today was that but 100 x worse. Archie was inconsolably crying  Erin banged her head and wanted to be held whilst I tried to steer a trolley and throw the essential nappies and any other food I could think of to help soothe Archie s throat. So when I finally arrived at the till not only where both kids crying but so was I.   Leanne saw how I was struggling jumped straight up  unloaded all my shopping  packed it up and reloaded it again allowing  me to comfort the kids.  It meant so much to me and I hope this message can be passed on to her.   A very very grateful customer					2016-08-13T16:34:21+0000	1471106061	2016-08-13 18:34:21	19	7	24	1	32	7	6	1	2	0	19	5	0	0	0	0	0

That must be 18 fairies  elves or pixies cos that s not 18 normal people! The illustration on the side of the box was deceptive  - it looks a decent serving but unless you use a laser to cut it with  have 18 guests all on a diet there s no way to get 18 servings. Be honest and say it serves 8 and if a customer gets 10 slices then they d be smug but to say 18 is cloud cuckoo land. After all that the cake was tasty - just pleased I only had 5 to serve & there s some left over for tomorrow:)					2016-08-13T16:30:37+0000	1471105837	2016-08-13 18:30:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I booked a delivery for this morning but didn t check out in time and lost the slot. When I booked another slot I forgot to amend the address before I checked out so I got a call from the delivery driver at 7.30 this morning asking where I was. Once we d established he was outside my old house he gave me the number of customer services to call to try and sort. I spoke to a lovely lady in customer services and she pleaded with your Crawley delivery centre to deliver to my new address (sadly they wouldn t  that is my only issue with today s service though). Anyway  she was lovely  she deleted my old address from my account so it didn t happen again. Anyway  a bit later on the delivery driver calls me back. He says he was just checking in on me  he said he d seen baby formula in my delivery and had I been able to sort a delivery for today and did I need the formula? I d already rebooked my delivery for tomorrow so was sorted but he didn t have to do that  he didn t have to make sure I was ok. He was lovely. I d like to thank him again  and you should certainly be pleased you have caring staff such as him  and also lovely people like the customer services lady that commiserated with me at 7.30 this morning! Unfortunately I didn t catch either of their names.					2016-08-13T15:39:09+0000	1471102749	2016-08-13 17:39:09	7	2	9	1	12	2	1	1	1	0	7	2	0	0	0	0	0

I understand she was going on her break but she could of put it more politely. It made me think do I want to shop here if staff are like that. This was in your Royston Tesco Extra store.   Also while in your store I found these shoes and really liked them but I forgot my vouchers and didn t take enough money with me. Do you sell these on your F&F website  I ve had a look but I can t seem to find them. I d rather like to order them online because I don t drive and your Royston store is 90+ minutes away on a bus. I really hope you can help me find them online.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13901331_10210175010916975_446201643864583074_n.jpg?oh=6b9e07e57789b48a028718c3325de601&oe=591FDC2D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13901331_10210175010916975_446201643864583074_n.jpg?oh=e316220d7cb12e6ddbb97584cd28a119&oe=59222638	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210175010916975&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-13T14:17:42+0000	1471097862	2016-08-13 16:17:42	0	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	3	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0

I am currently in your Leigh store (Manchester) to exchange some shoes..... I put them in a cupboard and basically forgot about them and they don t fit... They are outside the 30 days and so not requiring a refund.  I have my receipt but because one of the pairs (there are two) doesn t have the barcode label on it they won t exchange?  They are clearly not worn and still have the clip that holds them together... The lady on the til even readily admitted that they could have been sold to me without the label on them... Do I really now need to go home with shoes that don t fit and waste my money?

On 8 different occasions I (with my 7 year old son) have bought chocolate doughnuts from Tesco in Flitwick (Bedfordshire). All of them have been stale. We usually put it down to the time of day (usually after school) or just a old batch.   We have just been to the aforementioned Branch and  with the reasoning that at 10.30am the doughnuts should be fresh  bought another pack of Tesco chocolate doughnuts. It is a standing joke between us that they are always stale  but our hope remains.  I have just sat with a fresh coffee and a dounut. It was stale again. I have not been to the branch as I suspect that the staff there are busy and listening to my doughnut related  angst is not high on their list of priorities. Also it is 1/2 hour of my life I would not get back whilst the staff member is pretending to care about my doughnut woes.  My quest for a edible chocolate doughnut has reached MelvillIan proportions it seems. Please please can someone talk to the assistant head of doughnut making and ensure that the flitwick branch has a few that are not as dry as cardboard.  yours jay adshead	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13892197_10153587627392024_411577476561737953_n.jpg?oh=e0779975937235f2a5bcec7958f0db05&oe=58D6BAAB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13892197_10153587627392024_411577476561737953_n.jpg?oh=a41ee36bc6b6081c00632d1e108f2e5b&oe=58DC7FD7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153587627392024&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-13T11:12:32+0000	1471086752	2016-08-13 13:12:32	4	11	4	0	15	11	3	8	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Any time I m going in for just a few things I usually just put them in my shopping bag which has never been a problem until today. When I was asked to use a basket because  it made me look suspicious . I wasn t aware of any obligation to use either a trolley or basket to carry my shopping around in.  Telling regular customers they  look suspicious  doesn t make them feel too appreciated.					2016-08-13T11:09:45+0000	1471086585	2016-08-13 13:09:45	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

During the week  the regular staff are brilliant  the store is welcoming and customer service is excellent. At weekends it is a totally different story.  The weekend staff have no concept of customer service. This morning - and this is normal for a Saturday - the newspapers were in a complete shambles. I could not find The Times  then realised another gentleman was also looking for one. We eventually found them  under a pile of Daily Mails! We then realised there were no magazines in the paper. We discovered them in a pile  nowhere near The Times. How many people got home to find their paper incomplete I wonder.  I told the girl on the till the papers were in a mess  to which she replied  they didn t arrive in the right order . What on earth does that mean?  To add insult to injury the lottery machine is out of action for the second weekend in as many weeks. The reason  It has run out of paper and we are waiting for it to come in.  Unbelievable.  The store is so bad at weekends  I regularly phone Tesco Customer Service who assure me they take up complaints with the management. But nothing ever happens. What a shambles!					2016-08-13T09:27:43+0000	1471080463	2016-08-13 11:27:43	1	13	1	0	14	13	4	9	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Perhaps you would consider also removing Tic Tacs from the display beside the checkouts? These contain upwards of 91g of sugars per 100g of product (depending on the variety) and would probably be classed as a sweet in most people s opinions. Especially the brightly coloured fruit flavoured versions which clearly appeal to younger customers.					2016-08-13T09:02:09+0000	1471078929	2016-08-13 11:02:09	2	10	2	0	12	10	2	8	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to the checkout to pay for a bottle of chambord and was challenged for ID which I provided. My sister who was accompanying me did not have ID despite being 30 years old. We were then refused sale because she did not have ID. When I asked to speak to the manager I was spoken to by a man called Scott  one of the Wishaw store managers and I was absoloutely appalled. We were told that we could have been a couple and that I looked much older than her (I am 5 years younger) so not only did the manager publicly insult me  his attitude towards us was a disgrace. He was snappy  abrupt  and completely rude to me and my sister. We felt so intimidated and were shocked at how poor the customer service was. I feel completely discriminated against because of my age  and I feel he would not have spoken to someone of an older age group in such a manner. I then had to purchase my products from a tesco extra which cost me more than it would have in the larger store! As the person who was buying the product  I had the correct identification and it should make no difference who is with me at the time. If I had children would they be asked for ID aswell?  I have been a customer of tesco for years and I now feel uncomfortable visiting the store again. I want to know what s going to be done about this ASAP  and I feel the manager is a disgrace to the store. I understand the law regarding the sale of alcohol however I have never been treated so poorly in a store in my life!

I would like to say this was unusual but it is like this whenever I use the store. Me and my child were queueing down one off the Isles before I took this picture. I have been so put off by the constant long queues I have taken my weekly shop to another big store.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14022248_10210846314817874_8879809623362218466_n.jpg?oh=8c56c3115de96986b18f0e416e5eaf0b&oe=58EF7273	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14022248_10210846314817874_8879809623362218466_n.jpg?oh=4f8dfbef55b819263b974b11cdb6c169&oe=591ED87E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210846314817874&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-12T19:27:46+0000	1471030066	2016-08-12 21:27:46	6	6	7	0	13	6	3	3	8	0	6	0	0	1	0	0	0

You cant just pop in and buy yourself a 500ml bottle of Coke. Nope  if your driving  you have to spend a minimum of £5.00. Even if you have just filled your van up with £50.00 of diesel  if you don`t spend at least £5.00 in store you get charged to park. I was in there less than 30 mins  and have received a £70.00 parking charge for the privilege. So  no more Tesco shopping for me. (usually spend around £130.00 per week on our main shop) Off to Morrisons it is from now on !!!!					2016-08-12T19:16:58+0000	1471029418	2016-08-12 21:16:58	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Curious to know how you would interpret the sign about sun cream. I see it as any 2 spf creams for £9 or a single cream for £8.50. If the offer was limited to the same spf it should say by 2 for £9 but ANY implies ANY Nivea sun cream. Not according to the guy in tesco Bournemouth town centre who made my mum choose two of the same spf!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13925146_10154624201627150_9005161834909417524_n.jpg?oh=26988eea7007cbc36ac3e66bce76bb02&oe=5919082C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13925146_10154624201627150_9005161834909417524_n.jpg?oh=3b90ce95e76badfe2c36e813bc4ca832&oe=5917DB58	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154624201627150&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-12T18:44:23+0000	1471027463	2016-08-12 20:44:23	0	8	0	0	8	8	5	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Nobody had contacted me  I spent over £150 on this one piece of furniture to finish of the collection of the rest of my bedroom furniture that I purchased from you! The only suggestion that would be made by the customer services advisor is that she could knock off the £6 delivery charge and rebook my delivery slot for over a week away! This service is simply not good enough! I have asked for a refund but as it is I have been told that will take around 5-7 working days!

Having recently moved  we have started using yourselves for our regular food shop; we had previously been Sainsbury s customers. We ve been pretty impressed so far  particularly as we re saving a bit of money. I popped in today to pick up some milk and purchased a Finest Sea Salt and Black Pepper Cob as I really fancied a crisp butty for my lunch (because I am an ADULT). However  I found the bread to be really  really dry - not even salvagable by extra butter - so I feel that my much anticipated lunch was a bit of a fail  which was disappointing as I d purchased the ~fancy~ bread especially. Is this bread always this way  was it a dodgy batch or are my expectations for the perfect crisp butty just too high?  Any help would be much appreciated. But  btw  totally not mad at you because your Cookie Crumble Icecreams are my new fave 😘					2016-08-12T16:09:32+0000	1471018172	2016-08-12 18:09:32	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She remembered me everytime I went into the petrol station during my pregnancy and when I went in the other day she remembered me and asked me what I d had etc. My little boy turned 1 on Wednesday. I thought it was such great customer service to have remembered a customer like that and to be friendly enough to ask a year later. I just wish I knew her name.

I have been buying Streamline Thick Cut Marmalade from your Clevedon store for the past few years. Today I was very disapointed to discover that the preserves section has been drastically reduced in space and Streamline Thick Cut Marmalade no longer stocked. This product was a favorite purchase which made my 10 mile round trip worth making. I will now no longer make that trip and shop in my local Sainsbury s store instead (Three mile round trip)					2016-08-12T15:57:25+0000	1471017445	2016-08-12 17:57:25	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have a 7 month old boy. And last week had to leave my child alone in his buggy in the carpark  while I reversed my car out enough to be able to open the door to get him in! Obviously this has massive risks  someone could have took him  or the breaks on his buggy could have failed  and he could have rolled into my car  or someone else could have hit him! I was livid  but I really had no other choice. I made sure I could see him at all times  but my point is why do you no longer do parent and toddler car stickers? And why do you not have people patrolling the car park? I have asked people without chldren before  why are they parking there  to be met with a barrage of abuse. If the situation is not rectified soon I will start shopping elsewhere. I have complained to the staff today  who said they would pass my concerns onto the manager. It really is ridiculous  and hope its sorted soon.					2016-08-12T15:00:04+0000	1471014004	2016-08-12 17:00:04	7	23	8	1	32	23	10	13	23	0	7	1	0	0	0	0	0

The reason for this was that he exited at the same time as someone with a trolley and the alarm beeped  he told the guard that it must have been something in the trolley....the guard did nothing about the man with the trolley. I phoned to complain   got my story told but was  cut off  !!  Not good Tesco.					2016-08-12T14:25:05+0000	1471011905	2016-08-12 16:25:05	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Twice in the last few weeks we have brought my disabled mother to your store at Great Notley Braintree and twice we have had to come away empty handed! Both times the wheelchair has been unavailable first time  in use second time broken. Now as a fair sized store I would expect at least 2 to be available so if one breaks you have a spare. The store up the road in Dunmow has 5 and at least one of those is electric. We have no room to bring mums own wheelchair and then fill the car with groceries. We pay for mum to be taken out by carers and mileage costs add up  Notley is our regular store and the one she wants to use but is now considering heading to Sainsburys! While I recognise you cannot have a fleet of wheelchairs available having one rickety old wheelchair is not quite customer service!

The fresh foods are always well in date everything is packed in the correct bag for items ie: FREEZER Blue bag  FRUIT/VEG Green bags ect The driver/delivery men are as in store VERY helpful polite clean chatty and make sure we are happy with order before leaving.

I was in a lot of pain with being pregnant and suffering with SPD and sciatica and she saw me struggling to push my full trolley  which also had my toddler in  back to my car and she came over to help  pushed the trolley for me  helped put my shopping in the boot and even took the trolley back for me.

I ve never had a problem with doing a online shop till now shopping was delivered in the time slot last night it wasnt till i was putting my shopping away that i realised that the picker has picked up the wrong item i ordered 3 packs of tescos coke 2 packs were what i wanted however the 3rd pack wasnt what i ordered and unfortunately i cant get to my local store to exchange the drink as i dont drive so cant get there and i dont even like the stuff so its sat on my kitchen worktop looking lost and wondering what to do with itself since not 1 person in my household will drink it.  second issue i have that is worrying me is that my shopping was delivered and is sat in the cupboard/fridge etc waiting to be eaten but the money for my shopping hasnt been taken out of my bank when before the money has been taken out straight away now im being honest here as certaintly dont want to be accused of shop lifting or anything and the money has been in my account since tues which is when i did my online shop please could you sort this out and take the money out of my account so i know that its safe to eat the food without having to worry about being accused of theft.

A yes or no will do.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13880225_10154544612740353_2527143383727051104_n.jpg?oh=b86e6dd46a80156493af95f30214973e&oe=59187AEA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13880225_10154544612740353_2527143383727051104_n.jpg?oh=b7b1b87ba4883847c13b6399838af513&oe=58E061E7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154544612740353&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-12T08:05:21+0000	1470989121	2016-08-12 10:05:21	1	2	1	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The voucher can only be used with a limited number of holidays (rather than any Hoseason holiday) I think that s underhand. It wasn t made clear on your website. So now I m sitting with a £50 voucher I won t be using  and I won t be booking my holiday with Hoseasons either. Thanks Tesco.

I would have thought with your recent profit loss due to greed you would not try and take even more money from your customers  you already have the dearest fuel out of all 4 main supermarkets. Because of your £2 greed charge  i decided not to order these items and will just go to Asda and purchase from the store.					2016-08-12T07:24:27+0000	1470986667	2016-08-12 09:24:27	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter age 9 was very interested to use this as shes too big for the baby seat and some staff have said its unsafe to have her in the trolly where u put the food.Would I be allowed to use it with my adhd daughter or is it for other types of disabilities? The reason I ask on here is to avoid confrontations from staff. Shopping is extremely stressful but have found the scan as u shop helpful to keep my daughter from running off and getting stressed. Thank you for taking the time to read this much appreciated.					2016-08-12T07:23:59+0000	1470986639	2016-08-12 09:23:59	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This evening I spent just over an hour doing my weekly shop (as do most people) carefully placing my eggs next to my bread and kitchen roll (most of my which would ve been cheaper had I chose to shop around)  finally made my way to the till with in excess od £80 in goods (also take note previously regular daily customer at many tesco locals for daily produce) where after self scanning the majority of my items there was a strongerand sttstronger smell of a perfume on all of my scanned goods  having spent so long carefully selecting my goods and given the time of night  I was happy to see if I could get a discount ans would in tern happily wipe said goods down  I was subsequently offered £25 off my shop  to which I accepted   a few moments later the manager returned stating his manager is unable to do so and can offer to replace the items (by tjis time its 10:30 at night I have been in your store for over an hour and a half  and not only that I know the stock available on my items as a lot of it was limited ) to which I couldn t believe was the only alternative after already being offered a discount!  Thought you should know you ve lost a customer and how do you cancel a clubcard please? !?!					2016-08-12T00:30:13+0000	1470961813	2016-08-12 02:30:13	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was around her ankles Due to the shoddy fasteners! I won t be buying your brand again going through triple the amount I normally go through. I m a fan of own label...

On leaving I realised I had left my bag of shopping at the till. I went back and it had gone. I went to customer services and explained and was told to come back a few days later to see if it had been handed in. I repeatedly went in store and asked but nothing was there and was told it was  tough luck  nothing had been recorded each time I went in  so no one knew anything about it. I m really dissapointed how I was spoken too and that it wasn t just kept for me to collect. I ve been made to feel it s my fault someone else has taken and not returned it. Now I have no top  and have lost out on £16 😕 not happy Tesco.					2016-08-11T22:12:05+0000	1470953525	2016-08-12 00:12:05	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Could you please tell me why you feel that it is acceptable for your delivery drivers to deliver in such unsociable hours crashing and banging about like they are the only people in the world that exist? It is 10pm and yet again i have been woken up by this occurance from one of your stupid drivers as well as then sitting outside with his engine running whilst he completes his paperwork and then to add insult to the occasion he reverses 500 yards down the road with his reversing warning on! This I have to endure every week and I want it to stop to save my sanity some of us try to sleep reasonable hours because we have young children and work to go to in the morning!					2016-08-11T21:16:38+0000	1470950198	2016-08-11 23:16:38	0	8	0	0	8	6	5	1	12	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I really just wanted to take the time to thank Tesco and your staff for the great service I have recently received. I had a problem with my hudl2 tablet and emailed your team asking for advice. I quickly had a phone call organising a courier to collect it for repair. I contacted your tech team twice whilst my device was away for repair  each time  the customer service was top notch! My hudl tablet was dropped off by courier today. It was packaged well  cleaned and fixed! I m not someone who normally leaves feedback  but felt it was really important to leave a positive post and thank everyone involved in helping me with this issue.

Even though I never remember to bring my  bag for life  stock. And now have half a months salary worth in my cupboard.  But what I don t understand is the bags used when I order a delivery. Picture is of bags used for a small weekly shop. Most bags are tied so many times even bear grills would struggle to open without resorting to ripping them in half.

I just wanted to bring to your attention some of the amazing fundraising work your management and staff in Tesco extra Alloa have been involved in. A staff member  Laura Arnott was approached and asked if there was anything Tesco extra Alloa could do to help us raise funds for a local boy whos family is desperately trying to fundraise for specialised equipment he needs to make his daily struggle with quadriplegic cerebral palsy slightly easier. Without a second thought  Laura approached her store manager and enlisted the help of fellow colleagues Ryan Hartley  Ronnie Beresford and Leeann Cox to help! They have already raised a lot of money with a sponsored silence  an in house bake sale  a bag pack  a football match against our local Adsa (Tesco won by the way⚽️🏆) where they sold snacks  support bands and tombola and this weekend they have organised a sell out X Factor night that it sure to be a massive success!   Not only have this group of organisers committed their personal time and efforts  as well as some of their own money into making these events as successful as possible  they have been supported by the rest of the store staff and management who have donated money  bought cakes  attended or played at the football match and are performing/judging/voting at the xfactor on Saturday! The dedication of all the staff at the Tesco extra Alloa store has been admiral and so appreciated by the family concerned and they are an absolute credit to your company!					2016-08-11T18:58:56+0000	1470941936	2016-08-11 20:58:56	5	0	5	2	7	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered for next day delivery which was last Wednesday and messaged you straight away to say you sent me the wrong item. To begin with you said I could go to store to exchange  if I wanted to buy in store I would have done that to begin with. Then I m told you can get a replacement out to me Friday. Brilliant. Apart from you didn t and I m still waiting now. All I get told is the department that deals with it isn t responding  not really acceptable.  Once you refund my money for the item I will take my business elsewhere.					2016-08-11T18:10:24+0000	1470939024	2016-08-11 20:10:24	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not very impressed at all! :( disappointing since I m a mobile customer and an online shopper.					2016-08-11T17:37:19+0000	1470937039	2016-08-11 19:37:19	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I then took the piece of chicken and box round to tesco(Edenthorpe) to which the bloke who served me chucked the chicken back in the box and gave me my £1.50 back! Absolutely disgusting I m just so glad I noticed it and my daughter didn t eat it. I hope to hear a reply.

I just wanted to sing the praises of Meg who was on the tills at your Hockwood store today. Shopping with a child is hard enough but shopping with a screaming baby who refuses to be put down is really difficult!

I came running in to their shop and asking at the desk for where the wet wipes were as my husband was dealing with our baby s nappy explosion in the car and had run out of wipes midway. Graciously they popped out a packet of wipes from under the counter and told me to bring it back when I finished. This allowed me to run back to the car much quicker  and we came back in later to purchase wipes and other bits!  Thanks to Jackie for helping out and being gracious.					2016-08-11T14:01:17+0000	1470924077	2016-08-11 16:01:17	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I have been extremely unwell recently and among other visitors a family member visited me from overseas. Before visiting he called into the Exe Vale store and purchased what appeared to be a lovely bunch of your Finest flower range as a get well soon gift. The price had obviously been removed but the feeding guidelines along with the  guaranteed for 7 days  tag was still attached. After 4 days 90% of them have died despite following the instructions to make them last longer. I shop weekly at the store using the click and collect service  as I was unwell following an appointment I had visited the store with a friend to pick up a few groceries and stopped at the customer services desk to tell them that the flowers had perished in an extremely short space of time. At the customer services desk  I was told extremely abruptly that they could do nothing without a reciept. I explained they were a gift as I had been unwell therefore I didn t have a receipt  and was then advised  or more like told that I needed to provide evidence that I had the flowers. The advisor (who had now adopted an unhelpful and patronising  tone) said I would need to return home and come back with the flowers and proof that they were from the store. I was only at the store as a friend had taken me as I was still unable to drive. For a loyal customer who shops weekly at Tesco  I was made to feel that I was simply lying in order to get some more flowers  my intention when calling at the customer services was more to inform them that the flowers had died much earlier than expected so they could log it incase any other customers complained. Not once had I asked for them to be replaced but in the short time I was there  it felt like I had a battle with an extremely rude member of your team who at the end was almost accusing me of trying to get some free flowers  in her words  don t think you can pull the wool over my eyes for free flowers . It was that comment that made me leave the desk and the store. Having done my weekly shop there for years  after this experience I will not be shopping in Tesco again. Maybe you could share these photos wil the customer service desk as the  evidence they require .	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13939398_10153540588947757_3962945878906247172_n.jpg?oh=cc7927fd3531293f0056f5072a045cbe&oe=58EB30C8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13939398_10153540588947757_3962945878906247172_n.jpg?oh=f400ae2771e62a28df853f54c38e03d9&oe=591DF1BC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153540588947757&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-11T13:45:07+0000	1470923107	2016-08-11 15:45:07	1	23	1	6	30	22	8	14	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I called in to Tesco Brighouse and bought a loaf of Genius gluten Free Toastie bread £2.90 🙈 this morning I called in to my local tesco in Sowerby Bridge and noticed  that the exact same product was 20p cheaper 🤔 may not seem a lot but below is a picture of my monthly treat shop which came in at around £13. (Also felt the sting when I bought 4 Warburtons/Newburn crumpets for £2! And the Hobnobs £2.19 for 8 biscuits)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13886298_10155346269689852_3019030788260122691_n.jpg?oh=91468a7e48e1743085896d26d01cc50c&oe=58D89523	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13886298_10155346269689852_3019030788260122691_n.jpg?oh=e9b9abe7b61ba2f4721535c20e4f2416&oe=58EA9857	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155346269689852&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-11T13:36:26+0000	1470922586	2016-08-11 15:36:26	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had just been shopping with my five year old son when I was walking back to the car past the fenced off area where the delivery vans park when I saw him doing this. He was unsuccessful on his first throw  with the cup falling back into the fenced area  so he picked it up and threw it over followed by a second. I had to explain to my son why a man in a tesco uniform was deliberately littering. Not a good example by your staff  who normally are more than helpful  including the young lady handing out the free fruit today  she was a credit to you. The young man? A disgrace.					2016-08-11T12:49:25+0000	1470919765	2016-08-11 14:49:25	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I emailed Tesco asking for my local store to start stocking Tesco pure wipes for baby (as my baby suffers with eczema and can t use other wipes). I received a call from customer services straight away and I was re-assured that this will be looked in to.  Days later the wipes were in store! I also commented that it would be so lovely and helpful to parents to have a free fruit snack for their children whilst in store (as I d heard about other supermarkets doing this).  This week my local store is offering free fruit for kids!  Don t know if this was a coincidence or that it was prompted by my comments but either way i m thrilled with Tesco!

I was doing my normal lunch time/break shop to Woodford Green Express in East London and I was looking through the reduce section. There was a number of vegetable dishes in the section which was not priced.  i took a few items to the till only to be informed that they was not reduced. When I spoke to the manager about the reason on why these items were being placed in this section if they was not reduced  he informed that they are there till 3pm in the day when at this time they would reduce them! i questioned this as false advertising of cost and the manager informed that head office has instructed all Express stores to do this!  So just to clarify   all items due to be reduced that day needs to be put into an open section for everyone to view and then customers will have to wait till 3pm to be able to buy these at a reduce rate? Surely this is not the correct way for the Express store to work?  I will be doing my lunch time shopping in Waitrose from now on  where i can relay on honest pricing!					2016-08-11T11:55:57+0000	1470916557	2016-08-11 13:55:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner and I recently tried to follow one of your online recipes. It was for chilli and ginger stir-fried broccoli and pak choi. I wanted to let you know that it was amazing. We sourced all of the necessary ingredients through you  as we shop with you weekly  and everything that you provided was of the very best quality. We ended up embellishing on the dish and adding your own brand udon noodles  a load more greens we had also ordered from you (sugar-snap peas  asparagus  spring onions etc) and we were absolutely over the moon with your steak  despite it only costing about £3.50.  Thank you  overburdened social media reps. Thank you  to your staff in store who pick out our shopping. Thank you to our friendly delivery drivers too.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13770330_10153781721432113_6543506400679014777_n.jpg?oh=57fb5174996cfdc2057ff828da290e17&oe=58E8174A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13770330_10153781721432113_6543506400679014777_n.jpg?oh=0564e6a581711fbc073794c1faf4f18a&oe=58DBD847	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153781721432113&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-11T11:54:38+0000	1470916478	2016-08-11 13:54:38	1	6	2	0	8	5	2	3	3	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

Constantly putting prices up  damaged and removing of stock  last week I done my shop there was 5 items I usually get that had been totally removed from the shelves! And the thing is its all your own labels that are being removed!! From paying 89p for a tescos curry sauce to paying £1.79 for a branded name is a big difference to people like myself... Alot of people I no don t drive so only use your store as it s walking distance and these people suffer  it s not fair to be honest!					2016-08-11T11:53:33+0000	1470916413	2016-08-11 13:53:33	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of them was tender and tasty as it should be while the other was gristle so thick It wouldn t cut. I know it wasn t an expensive cut but to me  both pieces should have been edible. Disappointed to say the least.					2016-08-11T11:30:29+0000	1470915029	2016-08-11 13:30:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was involved in a horrific car accident in Oxford on A34 on the 7th of june at around 9:30 pm. He claims that a Tesco lorry driver came for his rescue before the emergency services arrived. It was pouring that night. This kind gentleman calmed him down  stabilised his body  tried to arrest the bleeding and kept him going. Please help us chase him so that we are able to thank him personally for he did for us. We will forever be grateful to him. He was literally like an angel in disguise that night !!					2016-08-11T07:29:44+0000	1470900584	2016-08-11 09:29:44	11	3	11	10	24	3	2	1	3	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apparently the radio buttons on your online shopping site is just for conversion between weight and quantity.  If you want 8 loose seasonal potatoes you check the  quantity  button and put in 8.  If you want to order by weight you check the  weight  button and select your weight. Then click back to quantity and that is how many potatoes you will get. FORGET THE WEIGHT YOU ORDERED!  8 potatoes ALWAYS WEIGHS 0.96 Kg apparently.					2016-08-11T07:03:59+0000	1470899039	2016-08-11 09:03:59	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I found this photograph that I took outside of one of your extra stores(I do so hope you enjoy some tasteful gurning) as our last moment in Scotland. We all immediately recognised where the photo was taken  because we have fallen in love with Tesco.  From giving us an entire aisle of Irn Bru  to every flavour of chocolate milk  to 2 4 1 Tesco brand snacks that we are in the car as we drive all over Scotland  England  and Wales. You make us smile  Tesco. We hope to see you again someday.  <3 your loving shoppers  P.S.I miss your meringue nests	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13938432_1683612638627263_4646092398293841509_n.jpg?oh=c1d94bbfd076f3950c5e0fe2e3d667b2&oe=58DB7E5C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13938432_1683612638627263_4646092398293841509_n.jpg?oh=e4d80f3176daca483f6b6732a498b3e0&oe=591BFF20	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1683612638627263&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-11T05:45:05+0000	1470894305	2016-08-11 07:45:05	10	5	12	0	17	2	1	1	1	0	10	2	0	0	0	0	0

My 3 year old climbed on the side of my trolley causing it to tip over and fall on her- completely her fault.  She fell and banged her head hard on the ground.  One of your amazing Employees caught the trolley which prevented my 1 year old inside the trolley from also hitting her head on the floor! Amazing! I went to comfort my 3 year old and another member of staff was straight over and got a first aider to check her over. I of course was in shock and started crying. After getting the all clear from the first aider I finished my shopping to then be presented with a lovely bunch of flowers at the checkout! Thank you Tesco for changing what could have been a potentially devastating day!					2016-08-11T00:00:42+0000	1470873642	2016-08-11 02:00:42	2	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	1	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

They are still producing this contaminated product (both types on nibble sticks are effected).  These could seriously harm or even kill a small pet but Rotastak are continuing to produce this product.  They have failed to warn the stores supplying them  and failed to withdraw the product.

You have all this space  and all this opportunity  yet you still decide that the baby changing room can be a baby feeding room too.  An uncomfortable chair plonked next to a toilet  in a room with a bin full of nappies is not the right place to feed a baby.  Would you really take your lunch and sit on that chair next to that toilet  smelling those nappies?  Go on  try it  I dare you! Now imagine that you want a nice relaxed lunch  so that you can take your time over your yummy sandwiches  but someone else desperately needs to change a poosplosion (this involves carefully peeling all clothing off a baby  and wondering how on earth so much poo came from such a small person).  You could either rush your lunch  or let the poo in while you finish your lunch off.  Fancy it?  No  nor would a baby  or a mother trying to feed a baby. Please please please stop labelling toilets as appropriate feeding rooms.  There s a cafe upstairs.  Pop a sign up saying  Please feel free to feed in our cafe.  No need to buy any food or drink .  Or consult some real mothers and ask them what they would like in a baby feeding room (Hint: no toilets  a comfy chair or two  and a few toys for the older sibling).  And above all  please keep it seperate from the changing room  as poo and food really do not go well together. You re not alone in doing this  but you can be the one to make the change and show everyone else how to do it right. Go on  pretty please.					2016-08-10T22:13:51+0000	1470867231	2016-08-11 00:13:51	36	8	38	2	48	7	4	3	4	0	36	2	0	0	0	0	0

Myself (33) and my brother in law (21) went to my local tesco (Lydney) tonight to buy some potatoes for dinner and some Strongbow  we went to the till and my brother in law was asked for ID  we explained that he had sent it away that morning because he had passed his driving test but had a picture of it on his phone of his ID  the cashier called the supervisor who after disappearing for ten minutes said it couldn t be accepted. An older lady seeing the situation offered to purchase the alcohol for us and was refused because it wasn t deemed appropriate. My partner then went up and after coming home and cooking the potatoes for 45mins found them to be rotten in the centre  it s safe to say your customer service and your products sucked tonight. So disappointed.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13886451_1652688531710879_425116799251186941_n.jpg?oh=b9d14fee3d26021c210240e523ba1564&oe=58DC8FC0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13886451_1652688531710879_425116799251186941_n.jpg?oh=fccab99ba49de418554ad9ea0a7130ed&oe=58E90C5D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1652688531710879&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T21:53:02+0000	1470865982	2016-08-10 23:53:02	0	3	0	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Olive survived the journey from Greece to the UK & could hardly contain her excitement when she landed in a Tesco factory. Sadly Olive did not make it to the deli counter  she was  by some terrible freak accident  baked into a meringue. As you can imagine Olive was distraught when I discovered her  she cared not a jot that it was the finest of meringues  she cared not a figgery fig that the combo of sweet  n  salty can be delicious........Olive knew she did not belong in a dessert. I tried of course to intergrate Olive with the gang of garlic stuffed olives that I had in the fridge  however  deli olives are notoriously sniffy and they simply would not accept her into their pride. I do not wish to embellish on Olive s sad demise as it is very painful  suffice to say Olive is now laid to rest in a dark  cold place without ever achieving her life goals. Life is hard enough without having to cope with these traumatic experiences Mr Tesco. Please do all you can to ensure that this Greek tragedy is never repeated. Sleep easy Little Miss Olive...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13934584_10210224134785494_1622189091523844802_n.jpg?oh=b0dc3c2e69dee89bd3cbc0a4a3516c97&oe=58E2CCBB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13934584_10210224134785494_1622189091523844802_n.jpg?oh=bd36763b5f7007b57e8ad526bf7db2dd&oe=58E643CF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210224134785494&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T19:26:40+0000	1470857200	2016-08-10 21:26:40	38	11	66	9	86	11	7	4	5	0	36	2	0	23	3	0	0

It is Wednesday today and my vouchers have arrived  woohooo.  A few month back I applied for a Club card as I was sick of my husband getting all the juicy exciting vouchers. After all  it s me who does the shop...why should my beloved get the points?  So  as I was saying  the vouchers arrived today  you can imagine my disgust when I found out that my husband had actually hid them from me 😡 Anyway  I ve now got them in my possession 🤓 So I made a brew  got sat down and carefully opened the envelope. Was wondering how many boxes of Toffifee I could buy with my vouchers  by now I m drooling into my freshly made cuppa. Seeing little Tofifee stars in front of my eyes  oh I couldn t contain my excitement.  I ve posted a picture for you so you can share my delight in how many money off vouchers I ve received.  However  surely it cost you more to post it out? Thanks 😘	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13932810_10154350356272980_970212752833363929_n.jpg?oh=90d6384b409b2293452c582e49a9e687&oe=58D8BDD7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13932810_10154350356272980_970212752833363929_n.jpg?oh=587db44b8f01b60afeb475f4c0f2770b&oe=5922FAC2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154350356272980&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T19:05:57+0000	1470855957	2016-08-10 21:05:57	2	7	3	0	10	7	6	1	5	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

For all whom is concerned Jeffrey is alive and well and he s happily munching on some flowers as we speak. (but don t mention it to my dad it s our little secret) But anywho I decided to share this for awareness so Jeffrey s friends and family remain safe as this little guy  so they can grow into beautiful butterflies and live a long and fulfilling life.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13932689_965297480283214_6257193575384519555_n.jpg?oh=01f194c148dc49ec8ec26fae82f51eee&oe=58ECF21E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13932689_965297480283214_6257193575384519555_n.jpg?oh=627f3ff701923cdb2dc57b4109f38ffb&oe=591FFEE1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=965297480283214&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T18:53:16+0000	1470855196	2016-08-10 20:53:16	55559	27459	70943	57981	156383	19645	11971	7674	211438	0	54828	3531	168	11396	12	10	0

The kids always help by taking the empty crates back to the driver after we ve emptied them and today our lovely driver had an extra surprise for them. He gave them all an ice lolly and a summer activity book to thank them for helping! Smiles all round. A really lovely gesture and as always top service.

Needless to say he s made my wee girls night and amazing customer service   guy deserves a medal after that since he put a smile on my grumpy girls face :)!					2016-08-10T18:03:47+0000	1470852227	2016-08-10 20:03:47	5	5	6	1	12	5	4	1	4	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	0

So we order online every week without fail and don t get me wrong I do love the service but I have a few minor issues. But first let s set the scene we are two working adults with no car and it would cost us a tenner every time we want to get a bus to the nearest supermarket for shopping. We rent a small flat without a freezer....problem number one.  We are trying to be economical  cut down on waste and we plan our meals.  Our delivery we order every Monday and costs us £4. If we don t spend 40 a week it costs us another 4 quid....so we now are forced to spend 40 a week just to justify the cost. That s alot for two of us...plus cat. In addition the food we get is not always fresh.  Take for example today is Wednesday our food arrived on Monday  Chicken for two meals  then mince for today tomorrow.  Can t freeze remember.  Open the mince it s OK for today but won t be good for tomz.  So 2mz dinner in the bin and we will have to get a ready meal from the newsagents on the way home. Again delivery on Monday but by Friday their is no way we can get fresh to last us the weeknd. So we still have to go out and get more food. Our monthly shop is now 200 quid a month minimum....quite a lot for two adults......it s not ideal and it s frustrating and I m fed up of not ever getting fresh enough meat to last the week.....grumble over.					2016-08-10T17:57:37+0000	1470851857	2016-08-10 19:57:37	0	11	0	0	11	11	9	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Have ordered loads of clothes for my twins and have always clicked and collected and done my food shopping same time.  Am really disappointed that I will now get charged £2 if order is under £30 and tbh this has really put me off ordering from you.  I placed an order for some sites w for my girls and one pair didn t fit so now I m forced to re order and pay the charge for 1 pair of £ 5 shoes!  Really bit happy at all.  Also why have you changed the invoice that comes with the order?  There s no prices on them and the assistant was really frustrated and had to ask me to see my original order via my phone!  Really really not good!  Please re think these things tesco because in an already difficult financial time you ve made it more difficult for customers and you will be losing customers if you keep these new policies going					2016-08-10T17:48:04+0000	1470851284	2016-08-10 19:48:04	2	6	2	0	8	6	3	3	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately we got back from your West Brom store with an upset sobbing child. She picked up a new toy  we asked a staff member the price and he gladly got out his iphone and scanned the pack to give us a price. When we got to the till we were told the  item was not on file  so can t be sold. This is the second time  has happened when  we get to the tills. Why fill a shelf full of new product that we can t buy?? Try explaining that to a 6 year old.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13935054_10157264665930416_3474620188415344388_n.jpg?oh=88ea08bfb26972c62a50d6af071b892c&oe=58D8C46F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13935054_10157264665930416_3474620188415344388_n.jpg?oh=2cacced283c819cd36401b48a108fe15&oe=5921CF62	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157264665930416&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T17:41:58+0000	1470850918	2016-08-10 19:41:58	4	4	4	0	8	3	3	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I tried to purchase a pack of two shirts with a tie that was reduced to £5.  It scanned through at full price. £16. the checkout operator checked with a manager who said someone must have just placed that sticker on it. After i said there were others on the shelf at the same price. He went off. Came back a few mins later said there wasnt and it was full price and proceded to pull the reduced sticker off. So i left the shirts and paid. After i put my shopping in the car. I went back to check that i had not made a mistake. I was right. There was more of the same shirts all reduced to £5. So you manager didnt even bother to check! Photo attached( his name was Nathan as i went back and asked the checkout operator) very bad customer service!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-0/s130x130/13939341_10155063689549838_6462159787870174871_n.jpg?oh=cc93d1235cc6c92aa3949dd6eb04b5a0&oe=58EAD0F6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-9/s720x720/13939341_10155063689549838_6462159787870174871_n.jpg?oh=6756828045eac4ec3b031d827c336863&oe=58DE82FB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155063689549838&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T17:28:26+0000	1470850106	2016-08-10 19:28:26	2	9	2	0	11	9	3	6	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a dog toy from you in the shape of a rugby ball with cut outs in it where it allow a dog to get at the tennis ball in the centre.  Unbeknowing to me  as my puppy lay under my chair  she was stripping long lengths of the tennis ball covering and swallowing it whole.  She was very ill yesterday until she was sick last night.  I am hoping there is no more left in her stomach as I have just found out that if this is left in the stomach for more than 24 hours it can result in death.  As she is not eating yet  my vets has advised me to visit them were surgery may be on the cards.  I would like to know if you are still selling this item and what safety check do you go through before stocking them in your stores.  I realise I have boughtone eexpensive toy!!!!					2016-08-10T17:10:03+0000	1470849003	2016-08-10 19:10:03	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Despite her being on holiday she still made arrangements to help and today I was contacted to say one of the managers had got some bits together for us. I know how busy stores can be at this time of the year and for one of the management team to take time out of her day to personally choose items she thought would benefit the autistic children such as scented pens and brightly coloured card  as well as pre packed snacks I am truly touched.

As we reached the top of the escalator near the store entrance I noticed an elderly gentleman approach the security guard with his trolley. As my dad stopped to reach his shopping list out of his pocket  I looked back to the elderly man chatting to the security guard. It was pretty evident from hand gestures that he was asking the security guard if he could take the trolley out to the front of the store where his car was parked less about than a metre away so he could unload his shopping. I could also see the security guard was telling him he couldn t. The security guard began pointing down the escalator suggesting that the elderly man could move his car to the underground car park and then bring his shopping down in his trolley. This was when I started to get angry as this was a very elderly gentleman who obviously struggled as not only did he have a walking stick but was also visibly shaking. I can only assume the gentleman said he didn t really want to do this as this was the point the security guard started to remove the bags from his trolley. My dad was just about to go over to help so I told him  no  its fine  the security guard is helping him . I could not believe my eyes when the security guard proceeded to load the elderly gentleman with the bags and it was immediately evident the elderly man was struggling. My dad then ran over to take the bags off of the gentleman before any more could be handed over and help him take them to his car which was literally parked right outside the store entrance. Now I understand that a security guard may not be able to leave his post  but surely there would have been someone in the store he could have called over to assist in a more appropriate fashion. I am assuming the customer care part of the job description would surely cover a small act of common human decency such as this?! I dread to think what could have happened if my dad had not gone over to help him and he instead had attempted this on his own  unaided by his walking stick as he was obviously naturally unsteady on his feet without the numerous shopping bags your security card kindly loaded him with. My main aim of this is just to understand whether this is common practise in matters such as this which I sincerely hope it isn t as I can assure you  it will be the last time myself or my dad shop at Tescos					2016-08-10T16:20:27+0000	1470846027	2016-08-10 18:20:27	2	12	4	0	16	12	5	7	7	0	2	0	1	0	0	1	0

Put them in to the oven as instructed and had to take them out pretty quick. They gave off a terrible sour smell that was so bad I had to put them straight into the bin. The smell was a combination of sour milk and baby sick. These were the second pack of these I had purchased and the pack before had the same problem but I put that down to me having them a few days over the best before date. I got them from the New Oscott branch last week and they are still in date till 21st August.					2016-08-10T15:32:56+0000	1470843176	2016-08-10 17:32:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought some bell peppers from Portsmouth North Harbour today in a pack of five (Nightingale Farms)  to try out an idea I saw on a programme recently. Instead of putting them in the fridge and leaving it till the evening to prepare  I chose one and cut it open to prepare to stuff it. Once I d cut away the innards I noticed something green and spotty...and alive! It was a caterpillar! Goodness knows how it got in there as there were no holes! Well he s been rescued and put into a makeshift home by my daughter  named it El Billio  as its origin was Spain  with some lettuce and a stick  and some pepper; just in case he has acquired a taste for it. He s now happily munching on the lettuce. I m just thankful I hadn t put them all in the fridge  as mine tends to freeze sometimes! We are hoping to nurture it to butterfly stage! 🐛	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13876259_10153933834298981_1510123436824443405_n.jpg?oh=7d58518a94d3a276dfecc5f63cc6cd2d&oe=58E3EFA2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13876259_10153933834298981_1510123436824443405_n.jpg?oh=42db04dec4975d3a2f9ef3dd824e9d47&oe=58E14FAF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153933834298981&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T14:31:03+0000	1470839463	2016-08-10 16:31:03	6	9	7	2	18	8	4	4	7	0	6	0	0	1	0	0	0

Though your store has a VAST range of products  you will understand it s like walking into a grocery filled Narnia. Naturally  I ended up walking around trying to find an item (an obscure type of flour  my own fault really) with a gormless look on my face. One of your members of staff  Alison  a lady with shoulder length black hair came to my rescue out of nowhere. She had clearly seen me looking like a lost toddler seeking his mother. She was polite  extremely helpful and found the time in her day to have a chat with me. She also walked me directly to the holy grail of flour which I d be looking for for at least 15 minutes. Alison is a credit to your team and I do hope you pass on this message to her that she is doing a great job.					2016-08-10T12:39:20+0000	1470832760	2016-08-10 14:39:20	6	4	6	0	10	4	3	1	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I couldn t get to sleep and I can t focus on anything else. I messed up last night. Bad.   I went to get my 18 month old cat  Penny  some delicious wet food from Tesco last night. Her favourite is Rabbit and now that we no longer own Rabbits  she s allowed to eat it again.   So my wife and I spent at least 10 minutes checking EVERY SINGLE PACK of wet food in the huge Reading Tesco aisle. Finally  we find some Sheba Wet food. 50p each or 8 for £3 - essentially buy 6  get 2 free.   What happened next mortifies me. Please stop reading here if you re of a sensitive disposition.  In my haste to exit the store  I collected what I believed to be 8 packs of the delicious Sheba Wet food. However  when I got home to feed young Penny  I saw there were only 7. That s right  7  packs of tasty  refined rabbit. 1 less than the required amount to trigger the 8 for £3 deal.   I scrambled urgently to find the receipt and confirm my suspicions. I was right. Instead of spending £3 on Penny s dinner and breakfast for the next four days  I had spent £3.50 for only 3 and a half days.   Not only am I now 50p poorer than I should be  Penny will now have to skip a meal.   Never in my life have I felt so much shame. I ve let Penny down  I ve let my wife down  I ve let Myself down and most importantly  I ve let my British Money-saving pride down.   Please  when shopping at Tesco do not repeat my mistakes. Be wary.					2016-08-10T12:14:20+0000	1470831260	2016-08-10 14:14:20	1	15	6	1	22	15	2	13	12	0	1	0	0	5	0	0	0

Now those who have done it have all nominated people but let s try the corporations that support us. So today my nomination is for @TESCO; as they say  Every Little Helps  so let s see.   So how many stores will accept the challenge. However my rules are one store a day for 22 days! Each nominating another store to accept. Will @Tesco rise to the challenge - I will wait and see.   There are 22 vets a day that are committing suicide  and this is a small way to raise awareness for that.  The rules are simple:  * Every day you record yourself doing 22 push-ups. Try your best to reach 22. If that means doing assisted (from your knees) push-ups or that you have to stop and take a break that s fine but try to get them all done in one video. * Every day you must nominate a different person. Try to choose people you think will want to do this and/or have the ability to do it. * And finally  have fun with this. This is a simple and fun way to get the word out about a matter that more people need to be aware about. These brave men and women put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms and its sad that so many veterans feel that suicide is the only way out.k	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/13935999_10157219908585048_942498811_n.jpg?oh=734373add6d62b2ccc12b08bf4502615&oe=58EB00D1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/13935999_10157219908585048_942498811_n.jpg?oh=bbd3a02e9f00c209ba1dde5aa4d1d307&oe=58EDE185	https://www.facebook.com/10155527254450048/videos/10157219901490048	facebook.com	2016-08-10T11:37:56+0000	1470829076	2016-08-10 13:37:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I think it has a fault and I can t find my receipt :( the glass plate turn table exploded back a week ago when I was warming a microwaveable bowl of soup for 3 minutes on high. and now yesterday sparks are coming from where the light bulb is  you can see black marks on the cover to the right (as if something metal has been out inside to cook) I m wondering where we stand as we don t have the receipt  however this is clearly a dangerous item :(	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13873130_10153610217496809_7156771576266198885_n.jpg?oh=943924a0e3343e4f18e162141c912b84&oe=58E04954	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13873130_10153610217496809_7156771576266198885_n.jpg?oh=55f799c8ee332cf9f8795d2b1d2e8338&oe=58D96720	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153610217496809&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T11:32:03+0000	1470828723	2016-08-10 13:32:03	0	5	0	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I went to to my local Tescos in Oxford and parked in the disabled spaces as I am eligible and watched a car pull up with a man  woman and baby  they had not even drove over to parent and child parking where there spaces. I got out and told them it was disabled parking of which they ignored me so I said I would report them in the store then. When going into the store there was another lovely sports car with a young lad sat waiting with his window down  no disabled badge so I said politely  you do know you are parked in a disabled space and shouldn t be   so he said  Id better move then . when getting in the store I asked a young assistant in a suit  who was responsible for watching people don t park in the disabled spaces?  as there were cars right now parked there and there always are every time I visit and he said the security team. So he had a word and they were both moved but another seven seater in its place! They should give tickets and points on the licence to deter this  hit people financially  they might think twice!  This is a constant issue and no-one deals with it.					2016-08-10T11:31:18+0000	1470828678	2016-08-10 13:31:18	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We need not have worried. Today in your Skegness branch I witnessed at close hand 2 ladies  Angie and Alison  loading home delivery trollies with items from the fresh salad section. Each lady diligently checked the date on every item picked  replacing and picking again when there were better dates at the back of the row until finally selecting and scanning what was suitable. Great to see and I have little doubt that the rest of the picking staff would do likewise. Well done Tesco Skegness floor staff and their trainers. With our faith in your system now cemented my wife and I will now be happy to commence on-line shopping very soon. Thank you.					2016-08-10T11:09:19+0000	1470827359	2016-08-10 13:09:19	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just had my car washed at the Hand Car Wash at your Wokingham store. Before i handed over my key I specifically pointed out an area of paint damage on the bonnet and asked them to be careful/avoid it if possible.   On returning to the car this damage is now significantly worse. The staff were rude (language was a huge barrier) and insisted there was nothing they could ve done as it was water damage. This area has been subject to rain and shine for over a year and had stayed as it was.   I was told there was no one to speak to as the manager was on holiday. I asked for head office details and they refused to give them to me.   Can you help me?  Thanks!					2016-08-10T11:03:44+0000	1470827024	2016-08-10 13:03:44	0	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

But no the mattresses we received we no good and not up to standard so wanted to return them  phoned tesco (because that s who we purchased with) only to be told be actually purchased it from a partner and that we d be charged £60 to return.... I m not being funny tesco but to you £60 might not be much but to us that s a lot of money!! You re refusing to help and said the issue of club card points is a bonus  well I say it s incredibly misleading! In my eyes we purchases from you and shouldn t have to pay the return charge! We now won t be able to afford a second mattress for ourselves only one for our daughter so thanks very much I ll continue to suffer my sore back until such time as we can save the additional money!					2016-08-10T10:13:27+0000	1470824007	2016-08-10 12:13:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a multipack of Butcher s dog food from Deysbrook Tesco  Liverpool which looked completely fine  however when we got home and were unpacking  I unpacked it upside-down (luckily) and noticed half the tins were dented and damaged. More shockingly  they were rusty with what looks like holes in the bottom of the tins.  It s such a good job that we noticed this because if I had fed my dog these tins I don t know what the consequence would be eating food with rust in.  I think they ve been dropped by Tesco staff somewhere along the line but they should never  ever have been sold incase they risk a dog s health/life.  I m absolutely furious thinking what would of happened if we d fed her food with holes in the tins and rust in the food. It s completely unacceptable.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13880379_10210227347270035_8783365138196970124_n.jpg?oh=67b4898009d3a856a902224ef55d4952&oe=58DA5D46	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13880379_10210227347270035_8783365138196970124_n.jpg?oh=8527a6d1b97b60c9d9a7e8ca1e3930e1&oe=58DB004B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210227347270035&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-10T10:11:18+0000	1470823878	2016-08-10 12:11:18	1	2	1	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

She is a pensioner and on the 29 July had care of her disabled adult son  Mr F who lives in a specialist residential home in Northamptonshire. On the 29 July at 15.11h Mrs F had attempted to park her car in a disabled parking bay outside Tesco Express on Wanstead High Street so that she could push her son in his wheelchair to choose some food for dinner. Mrs A and her son were verbally attacked by one of your staff for legaly parking in a disabled space outside of the store. Your driver  an eastern european man was driving delivery lorry  Mercedes KM61 RXX. He shouted at her and her son that he had been waiting to use the  disabled  space for twenty minutes to make a delivery and she had better move out if his way or he would move her car with his truck! She got out of her car and showed him her son s blue badge  he completely disregarded this and continued to verbally abuse her and her son with increasing anger. Your employees threatening behaviour forced Mrs F to flee the space in fear for hers and her son s safety. Mrs F saw a traffic enforcement officer as she drove away from outside the store. She stopped her car to tell the enforcement officer what had happened in the disabled space outside of the tesco store. He told her he could not do anything about the incident Mrs F and her son had experienced but that he would certainly go and give your lorry a parking ticket. This man will remember Mrs F. Mrs F then drove off to find an appropriate place to park so where she would be able to push her son in his wheelchair and buy some food  they went into the bakery on the high street where the member of staff is also likely to remember her and her son due to their distress. Mrs A took her phone out during the incident intending to take a photo of the registration number of the lorry so that she could report your driver  fortunately she accidentally took a short video in which she can be heard very upset  telling your driver she will not argue with him but she will report him to Tesco. I am not able to attach the video but have attached a still from it to this message. I will retain the video for your viewing should this be required.  Mr F was born with a chromosonal condition called Trisomy 13  this means he has a severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of his body. Mr F also has heart defects  brain and spinal cord abnormalities  poorly developed eyes and extremely weak muscle tone. Mr F also has Type 1 diabetes and is partially sighted and hearing impaired. Mr F has been left traumatised by the behaviour of your employee and due to his conditions he cannot make sense of what happened to him and his mum.He is 39y of age and has a mental age of 8y.  I am extremely upset by the completely inappropriate behaviour of one of your employees and upset by the hugely detrimental impact this has had on my friend and her extremely vulnerable son.  To add to the distress  Mrs A has subsequently received a penalty charge notice for stopping in a bus lane 4 minutes after this incident as she spotted a Parking Enforcement Officer and stopped to explain to him what had happened. This fine is £55 increasing to £165 in 28 days. I have challenged this on her behalf on the basis of her predisposition following the attack by your driver! How many more vulnerable people has he abused?  An apology from the driver and TESCO is the least we expect for Mrs A and her son Mr F.					2016-08-10T09:42:00+0000	1470822120	2016-08-10 11:42:00	2	9	3	0	12	9	6	3	5	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0

It was my first time  clicking and collecting  and the moment is one I will never forget!  I was nervous to begin  but was eased through the process gently as a first timer should be  and my overall experience was one I will never forget! I was hesitant at first and even went to the wrong location. Bi-product of nerves I suppose  but the person who directed me to where I had to go to collect my groceries was really helpful and even took my empty trolley from me that I collected through habit! I made my way to the click and collect area and the chap was very happy to hold my hand through this life changing process  explained about the  substitutions  and helped me to load my stuff into the car despite me being the last customer of the day! He was very friendly and offered a lot of encouragement.  After getting back in my car  I felt a big sigh of relief knowing that the 3 mins I had spent there will forever change my life for the better. I found myself telling everyone about it to the point people were asking why I was so excited. It just felt good for my first time and know I ll come back for more!  I love you Mr Tesco!

After unpacking many boxes and getting a chance to relax I was shocked to see a delivery van driving past my road end  which continued on almost a daily basis! After speaking with your customer service department I was informed I would have to wait 6 months to a year for them to make a decision on whether they would deliver to my address. After talking with others I have found that you are delivering 15 miles further away from my address and still passing my driveway on a daily basis. My postcode is PH18 5UE and a reply at your earliest convenience would be greatly appreciated.					2016-08-10T08:07:47+0000	1470816467	2016-08-10 10:07:47	4	15	6	0	21	15	7	8	2	0	4	0	1	0	1	0	0

However  instead of turning the cake mixture a pink/red colour  the red food colouring made the mixture a horrible greyish-purple.

Unfortunately he had gone into the store by the time I got out but I have his registration number and pic of his car if you want to do anything. One of your trolley men was there but he just laughed when I spoke to him. Such a shocking attitude to your disabled customers.					2016-08-09T21:30:21+0000	1470778221	2016-08-09 23:30:21	1	10	2	0	12	10	7	3	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Please could you advise as to why your tesco chorley store have stopped selling the oatly single cream. My youngest has several food allergies and this is the only cream she can have that I use in our cooking. I buy quite a few of these cartons a month and was very upset to find it has been discontinued in my local store. I already have to go round at least 2 supermarkets to do our family shop.

Today I watched Man Of Steel  on the back it too said I could download a digital copy  only problem is I had to download it by 02/12/2015.

With the clubcard boost I always trade for la tasca vouchers. I ve had £20 worth from last time and just ordered another £20 last night. We usually go to la tasca in Glasgow. I ve just went on to book a table to find out the restaurant in Glasgow has closed down and so has the one next closest which is silverburn so now I basically have £40 worth of vouchers I cannot use. I m hopeful that you can at least change these for me so I can use them in a restaurant a bit closer to home. The nearest la tasca to us now is hundreds of miles away in England. I would be extremely grateful if you could help me out. I look forward to hearing from you.					2016-08-09T21:14:27+0000	1470777267	2016-08-09 23:14:27	5	5	5	0	10	5	2	3	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Being lactose intolerant this has enabled me to enjoy summer  such as it is in the UK  along with the rest of the family. That is until this evening. After dinner my loving husband (shhhhhhhhh don t ruin his street cred at work) went to the freezer and kindly passed me one of my favourite treats. Unfortunately  there were a lot of water crystals and a soggy wafer cone. Now  we use your wonderful home delivery service and when the frozen food is received it is indeed frozen  which leads me to the horrifying thought that this thaw and refreeze must have happen prior to being loaded onto the delivery van. Please  PLEASE could you use your wonderful powers and ask the lovely staff who will have handled my ice cream from cow to house to make sure it stays frozen.

After finally securing my 10mth old son in the trolley I entered the store to b met with some form of alarm going off  as the security were not stopping anyone entering we assumed it must be a drill and went to start our shopping. I was approached shortly after entering by a female member of staff to say it s not a drill and we r evacuating. She asked me to empty my trolley and then leave!?!?! I only had some birthday cards so thankfully it didn t take long 😡 I followed the general stream of staff as no one was instructing us where to go for the fire assembly point. I stood amongst some staff in a huddle and noticed they took the time to check Facebook  take selfies and have a cigarette! I was furious as my baby was next to them at this point! A staff member pointed out we weren t even half way to the official meeting point!!!! But the shoppers were left outside the main store door! So dangerous 😡 what a shambles! Clearly this store don t care whether their customers r burnt???? Poor manners  bad conduct and atrocious safety knowledge. I will NOT be returning and putting myself and my son in danger ever again!					2016-08-09T19:50:13+0000	1470772213	2016-08-09 21:50:13	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Once again there are loads of empty shelves. Once again a promotion is running and surprise  surprise - only one part of the two part promotion is instore. The usual place for the promotion has been filled with other similar items on promotion (but NOT the item that was originally there.) They turned up hidden further into the store on the top shelf towards the end of the aisle. The promotion was clearly printed on the box  but there was no sign of the second item. Thinking that a staff member may have  hidden  them somewhere else entirely we searched the store. Finally giving up looking we went and asked a member of staff for help. She was very helpful and took us straight to where they should have been (which is exactly where we had first looked). She was surprised to see that they were no longer there  so went and found a member of staff who she said could give us more information.  When he appeared he tried to tell us that they had NEVER sold the second item in that store. When I pointed out that I had bought it there a number of times in the past he tried to back-track and say that they only get it in very infrequently.  It comes in for a little while and goes again.  I told him that that was NOT the case as I had seen it there almost permanently over the last year or so. He then looked really sheepish and said that they don t have it and it only came in for a part of the promotion  it sold out and that they aren t going to be selling it again. I told him that it was wrong to be selling the other item with the promotion printed on it if they had no intention of fulfilling the offer. He said that they were only a small store and that if we wanted the offer we needed to go to the bigger ones. When asked again about why they were selling only one half of a promotion (and that being the item with the offer printed on it) he said that  Tesco buy everything in bulk  so we may end up with items that have offers on them that we don t do here.  I told him that y couldn t do that as it was false advertising and as such it is illegal to do so. I also pointed out that it wasn t the first time that this particular store has had empty shelves when a promotion is on. We have been in quite a few times in the past and found this to be the case. It is amazing how the shelves are  magically  full once again the very first day after the promotion has ended. This cannot be a coincidence so many times.  As we went through the checkout a different member of staff confirmed that she too had bought the item a number of times from there so how can the store claim that they had NEVER sold it?!!!  SHAME ON YOU TESCO STORE IN BARRY  SOUTH WALES!!!  I think that I should go back to shopping at Morrisons or Asda  as I still have to go there to get the rest of my shopping tomorrow due to so many items not being available today.					2016-08-09T19:38:36+0000	1470771516	2016-08-09 21:38:36	0	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Message sent as follows - Just came from a weekly shop and quite upset. I was in the milk and yoghurt aisle at roughly midday today when a member of your staff pushed her home delivery trolley into mine. Only after I made eye contact with her for a few monents did she offer a weak  sorry  with a somewhat patronizing facial expression as she passed me. I m mostly annoyed about this for two reasons - firstly my 9 week old daughter was in her car seat in the trolley and secondly half of the aisle was taken up by 2 other members of your staff  both teenagers  flirting outrageously whilst discussing their driving passing tests. My daughter was in a specially adapted trolley where you put the car seat on top. I m both surprised and extremely upset by the actions of your staff today and sadly this isn t much of an isolated incident. Would really like to hear back from someone with regards to my complaint. Regards  Kelly Rogers.					2016-08-09T18:44:22+0000	1470768262	2016-08-09 20:44:22	3	8	3	0	11	8	2	6	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

It certainly has had no effect at all in protecting my dog. The cost of the Frontline was £23 so not a small amount for an ineffective product. I would like that money returned either by cash or credit  please. Unfortunately I can t find the receipt for the purchase but do have the purchase record on my bank account. Could you please advise.

I drove specially to your store at 5:15pm to be told it hadn t yet arrived. That s no problem  I understand that deliveries can sometimes be delayed  BUT what has annoyed me is the fact that the item is actually in stock in your store but upon speaking to the lady at click and collect I ve been told I have to go back on another day to collect my ordered item instead of being able to take one of the ones from in store. So that s a completely wasted journey for me and the kids😡					2016-08-09T17:32:32+0000	1470763952	2016-08-09 19:32:32	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When he arrived with her shopping  she was desperately ill and incoherent. He made sure she was okay and that my dad was on his way back home to her  and then as she was too unwell to do it for herself  he went massively above and beyond and unpacked all her frozen and refrigerated goods and put them away for her so they didn t spoil. I want him to get the recognition he deserves for not only doing his job fantastically well  but also for being a lovely human being. We are very grateful to him for what he did today.					2016-08-09T16:57:09+0000	1470761829	2016-08-09 18:57:09	23985	512	25484	1276	27272	499	456	43	432	0	23748	1321	150	4	2	1	0

This has left me and many others extremely disappointed. Why do profit making groups get priority over a non for profit group ran entirely by volunteers? The cloth nappy library is a huge help to those locally as not only does nic provide support and advice to those using cloth but she also lends out long term nappy kits to those who simply can t afford nappies and would have to chose between food or nappies for their children. How can you call a community room as such when the community isn t the most important factor in who uses it? Having been to the group weekly not once did the lady who organises the room come to meet us and ask how the group supported families  she didn t see how any passing family were welcome wether they used cloth nappies or not in order to let their kids play and chat to other mums. This in itself is lovely for local mums as some mothers at home are so starved of adult company they often pop up tescos just to get out of the house. However when attending another local group (profit making) I saw the lady who runs the room everytime and she was all over the companies who used the room. I am so disappointed in the situation. Maybe you should remember that community doesn t mean profits!!					2016-08-09T16:10:27+0000	1470759027	2016-08-09 18:10:27	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Sunday  I purchased fresh tesco rasberries which looked fine. I had a handful SUnday night in the breakfast pots   however on Monday night when I went to do the same thing  they were moldy  really moldy. Your fresh berries are much more expensive than the frosen ones which I normally buy but as I was part of the panel I thought I would try them. They had to be put into the bin. I am very shocked by the quality of the berries and very disapponted that no one from the Orchad panel would answer my complaint. Wont be trying any more fresh products any time soon.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q81/s130x130/13906798_10210600208305830_208802479703776296_n.jpg?oh=2f3a306d7e7380c5a75f6cd5d6b00eeb&oe=58DD06EE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13906798_10210600208305830_208802479703776296_n.jpg?oh=89d9227ea1a63df6536ef4a844eee383&oe=58E0DC73	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210600208305830&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-09T15:24:20+0000	1470756260	2016-08-09 17:24:20	1	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The manufacturers of the chemicals say they are safe to humans  but the people who apply the chemicals have to wear HazMat suits so how can this stuff be safe? and they are spraying it on our FOOD!!   Any substance sprayed on a porous surface will be absorbed and become part of the plant.  This will be ingested and sit in the human body until it causes problems. I don t buy food that has been factory farmed. I only buy organic. Organic food is real food and should be marked as such.  Food suppliers demand for profit should not be held more important than the lives and wellbeing of the people.					2016-08-09T13:02:40+0000	1470747760	2016-08-09 15:02:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to pick a banana for my 15 month old but she reached for an apple instead. She has apples at home but I slice them for her  however as she clearly wanted one I let her. To my surprise she managed to bite the apple (with just 10 teeth!) and eat the whole thing! She was so happy to be able to hold and eat the whole piece of fruit! I never would have given her a whole apple to eat at home so thank you for the opportunity for showing myself and my daughter just how capable she is at eating things by herself!					2016-08-09T12:35:45+0000	1470746145	2016-08-09 14:35:45	7	2	7	0	9	2	2	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

These sandwich thins are great for babies starting on solids. I spread a bit of full fat cream cheese or smooth peanut butter (make sure there s no hidden sugar or salt - I buy the Wholefood one) and then cut into strips for a great finger food option for their little hands. They don t disintegrate too quickly and there s no crusts that they can choke on. The 50/50 version gives them all the fibre they need and they still love the taste!  My baby only has the one (or sometimes just a half) at meal times. This is why I was disappointed that they only had 2 days left until their best before date when they were delivered this morning. I know they go stale quite quickly and I always make sure that I seal them in a container or freeze them after opening. But when you promise 4+ days on your website I m disappointed again.  I m beginning to spot a trend...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13669106_10154221828360791_2099175836350283191_n.jpg?oh=4fb7730312777ada1e94266acd6367ff&oe=58DB18E7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13669106_10154221828360791_2099175836350283191_n.jpg?oh=b2b4ec98f8ed033a69e3e7aaa72b0469&oe=58E2EA93	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154221828360791&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-09T12:25:26+0000	1470745526	2016-08-09 14:25:26	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

These spaces are already misused and subsequently at a premium.   At 7 months pregnant  I had to carry my 2 year old across the busy car park to get to the store due to lack of alternative safely positioned parking.   I complained to the duty manager (Scott) and was assured he d sort it out. When I left the store  it became apparent that A) he hadn t and B) that these vehicles were actually to do with Tesco - they had tesco signs in the window and what I presume to be their owners sweeping the pavement around them. Clearly the brooms must have been too heavy to carry from anywhere else in the car park.  This is a masterclass in how not to treat customers.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13900332_10154429208092718_3599111104872763958_n.jpg?oh=32aec85e3b8b40fd6ae8abf3a1356c91&oe=58E9740F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13900332_10154429208092718_3599111104872763958_n.jpg?oh=5b93188cb965babcc407134b6bb33bd8&oe=58E4FE7B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154429208092718&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-09T11:38:47+0000	1470742727	2016-08-09 13:38:47	0	8	5	0	13	7	4	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0

Ordering school clothes online was easy but delivery was terrible. Most of my order was missing. Tesco rearranged items to be sent ASAP (thank you tesco) Missing items were then received with extra trousers that I d already received (rang back to be told that I could keep them for inconvenience caused by the screw up) kept receiving 2 items I hadn t ordered for me to realise yesterday after receiving a delivery it was because they shared the same order number with the item I ordered.  Again rang back to explain why you kept sending me wrong items and what could I do with them (told me to take back to store for refund). Got woken up this morning by a delivery driver with original missing items. Rang tesco yet again as you was waiting for jumpers to come back into stock to send to me and these came this morning. Spoke to a rude person who told me under no certain terms I had to return all duplicate items to a tesco store ASAP other wise you would charge me for the extra you sent including the trousers I had been told I could keep. I ordered online as it was an easier option with 3 young kids (one with severe learning and behaviour disabilities) it s not my fault that hermes screwed up my order. It would of been easier for me to take all 3 kids in store to buy the clothes in the first place and put up with my son s meltdowns in store as I now have to go there anyway with them but this time they will have to wait patiently (not going to happen) in a line at customer services and then wait quietly (really not going to happen) for me to explain this whole mess to the staff at customers service ............

Great that you can make changes to your shopping basket up to 1pm of the day of collection.  Unfortunately  I ve been tried several times between 7am and 8.20am but am unable to due to a large amount of traffic.  Is there really so much more traffic at 7am than in the afternoon?!!!!					2016-08-09T07:22:07+0000	1470727327	2016-08-09 09:22:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I fell onto the floor and into the bottom shelves...fortunately containing tea bags - even so I have hurt myself.... when the Assistant came back with the First Aider I noticed she had picked up chewed and spat out Apple... I ended up with banana all over my jeans.... I then managed to stop an old lady slipping in it too.... I d just had a tooth extracted so yesterday wasn t a good day.  Yes I have reported it  I suggested offering the fruit on the way out.  I also heard the First Aided being called again as I left... what annoys me more is that this spat out fruit is a Slip Hazard and under Health and Safety Acts needs re-thinking.  I also feel your Company just are not taking me seriously.   I hurt myself in your store yesterday  I also got covered in spat out banana.... I d just had a tooth extracted...  yet nothing. That s all ...nothing.					2016-08-09T06:20:21+0000	1470723621	2016-08-09 08:20:21	2	19	3	0	22	19	12	7	7	0	2	0	0	0	1	0	0

Never again  the man-made cover makes the duvet so hot.  Totally impractical for summerweight bedding.

I understand that no business is a fan of something for nothing and a loyalty scheme for customers must really hit a raw nerve but it s certainly evident over the last couple of years that club card points  of which we choose to collect at Christmas have deminished considerably even though our shopping habits haven t really changed a huge amount. This is even taking into account of the fact that we no longer receive vouchers  only extra points.  Could you explain to me why I get the feeling that I m being completely shafted for being a loyal customer?

I purchased some of your own brand odourless cat litter the other day. Your packaging RAVES about itself.   After 2 days of use I can categorically say it is the most horrendous smelling thing I have ever purchased. If anything  it smells even worse than what cats actually do in it.   Don t get me wrong I know cat poo stinks right  but I also know what it smells like.... but somehow  hideously  as soon as it hits this litter it s smell becomes something entirely different.   Different is an understatement in fact  as it became something I would only expect to experience if I had to enter the seven circles of hell. I literally nearly dropped dead on the spot  my brain nearly haemorrhaged when I just opened the kitchen door and was hit by its  odourless  odour.   Anyway  just FYI  because somebody high up needs to know to check their staff can smell before they employ them to test odourless products in future.   Other than that  I bought a lovely onion to make a pasta bake the other night. Very rich in flavour.  Have a good night.					2016-08-08T20:39:02+0000	1470688742	2016-08-08 22:39:02	3	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just visited my local store (Leith  Edinburgh) to find it has been extended to 2/3 of a whole aisle! Been coeliac for 20 years and life is so much easier now. Definitely makes me shop with you when other supermarkets have a dark corner at the back for their free from range.

I have to say it a fair bit of a change in terms of stores. I feel Skegness is a bit smaller and lacks a few of what I think are essentials  however the joe bloggs of Skegness may not appreciate my necessities.   Definitely been wondering where the lack of scan and shop is in the store as well. My wife has been left with an extra free hand to add more unnecessary things to the trolley. Costing me a small fortune.  However in my 3 weeks of going to your Skegness store on a Monday night I have found some joy from the lack of scan and shop. That joy was in the form of Joshua on the tills. Been to his till twice and he was very enthusiastic and chatted to me about different things. Even when I needed bags he gave me the correct amount I needed for my shop. All in all fantastic. Joyous service and efficient all in one. The one thing I didn t realise was that he has only been there 3 weeks.   So my plea to you tesco is look after this young gent. He is an excellent example of what your staff can be and I just hope he continues to enjoy his job and deliver joy as well as good shopping. Please don t let him be another little drone and beat the personality out of him. Look after his little spark.  Pretty much I had an alright time chatting to your guy at the till and he seems like a good guy in your organisation.					2016-08-08T19:45:57+0000	1470685557	2016-08-08 21:45:57	3	3	5	0	8	3	1	2	1	0	3	2	0	0	0	0	0

I have to say I m not that impressed with how this has been handled so far. I almost fed this to my baby daughter  which is the only reason why I looked inside the sandwich. The sandwich was purchased on the 7th of July  and I complained on the 8th. I was told I would hear back with 2 working weeks. It s now been a month and we still haven t heard anything! My partner has chased this numerous times and we ve had nothing but broken promises. Please can you look into this and tell me exactly what is going to come of this and when I might get a response.

No blue girls shirts or skirts and limited blue shirts and trousers for boys in both stores. No girls plain white socks in either. I m afraid IV had to shop elsewhere for uniform. Come on Tesco there are schools that have uniform which isn t grey and white ! 					2016-08-08T19:20:37+0000	1470684037	2016-08-08 21:20:37	0	6	0	0	6	6	5	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can t buy any bananas from this store whether they are the open ones you bag yourself or already bagged for you. They are either heavily bruised  will heavily bruise  split or rotting! Too often there are rotting bananas in their bags or just left on the shelf. Now I know for a fact that the bananas have a very high turnover in this store as on a afternoon you are lucky to get a bunch as they are so frequently bought so how there manages to be rotting bananas I don t know! They are clearly not handled correctly. I have not he a problem with any other tesco stores so why this one????!					2016-08-08T19:20:21+0000	1470684021	2016-08-08 21:20:21	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s been a couple of years since I ve been down there; I know you did stock them there last time I went down but if I m going to cycle 15 miles I thought worth checking you have what I need first. Also  what happened to the plans to expand the Wolverton (north MK) store? There was a massive talk about it a few years back but as far as I can tell nothing happened?					2016-08-08T17:39:31+0000	1470677971	2016-08-08 19:39:31	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just got home and had to tell the wife i did nt want my dinner.  Thats the final straw  she said. She has just packed her bags and is heading to her mothers. Keep up the good work Tesco.

My 7 month old daughter was violently sick whilst we were doing the shopping today and Susan came to our rescue with wipes and clothing. Susan also assisted me with my shopping by holding my daughter and helped me to my car. Susan deserves recognition for all her help during a very stressful time and I very much appreciate it. I do hope you will be able to identify Susan and pass on my thanks to her  she is in my eyes  a very valuable member of staff in your team.

Self scanned my shop through and noticed one of the make-up items had gone through at a higher price than I d expected. I wanted to check I d not picked up the wrong item by mistake so went back to the cosmetic area where a very helpful lady (I think maybe the cosmetics manager) helped me to check my purchased products to identify which one had gone through at the wrong price then accompanied me back to Customer Services to rectify the error by refunding me double the difference! She also identified through our conversation that we had inadvertently dropped a mascara through the trolley on our rounds as someone had recently returned it to her to be put back on the shelf...saving me the upset of the  tween  it was purchased for!!! Well done Tesco Hardwick  couldn t ask for better service. 😊 (If you can identify the lady she had dark hair in a bun and was in smart work wear not Tesco uniform)  the lady who processed the refund was also very helpful! Well done ladies 😊					2016-08-08T16:44:40+0000	1470674680	2016-08-08 18:44:40	40	19	41	1	61	19	15	4	14	0	39	1	0	0	0	0	0

However I was disappointed when my local store (Annfield plain)  didn t even stock the guu deserts despite them been free on the offer with the pizza!  I think someone needs to speak to there management about what a offer means and how to order stock...  Very disappointed.					2016-08-08T16:19:34+0000	1470673174	2016-08-08 18:19:34	1	7	1	0	8	6	6	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon opening my pot and eating at least a third of the contents I discovered a white worm inside the wrapping trying to escape from a grape (see picture). I thought - at last  finally Tesco have come up with something to beat Aldi spider with bananas offer.  I excitedly shouted to my work colleagues whilst frantically logging into break to go and vomit in the toilet. We didn t have a clue what it was #1stworldprobs. My work colleagues mum works for environmental health and confirmed it was a maggot. ooooo how exciting! we have smuggled a creature into my top secret work place and he made it passed security! I proceeded to call her malorie the maggot.   Our new colleague malorie appeared to be very responsive  we just put it down to her having a sugar rush from all them grapes she ate through. What s she lyk!   I proceeded to check on malorie maggot throughout my shift and found she lost life so now on top of all this stress and excitement I have to try to plan a funeral to plan and to top it all off I ve totally lost my taste for berries snd now fear I will have to eat chocolate and roll to work! Ps I also work for complaints and it pains me to write this.   So come on Tesco wiggle your way out of this one every little helps ay!  **Just an update malorie body has been taken last night! I don t know who you are or what you are doing but I will find you and I will kill you!

When I took it off him the back was red hot. We immediately reported this to the tesco helpline. We asked if this was something they had heard of and we were told  yes it happens all the time. Today we ve been told that Tesco can t do anything because this is impact damage! We ve argued that my husband worked for the Tech Team before the homeplus format closed and if this was the case we wouldn t be wasting your time! I ve been honest and said if I hadn t been sat right next to him I d of been convinced he d dropped it and he d of been grounded for the whole of the summer holidays! But I was sat right next to him so I know that this wasn t caused by an impact. I now won t let him play with our other hudl as I don t believe they are safe.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13886247_10153617575201851_2031694936386493005_n.jpg?oh=0628a7a1a897821a838e892baeb9f982&oe=58ECF01D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13886247_10153617575201851_2031694936386493005_n.jpg?oh=ff9618abccd2faa0a8f71b37becc2766&oe=58E2FB10	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153617575201851&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-08T14:45:39+0000	1470667539	2016-08-08 16:45:39	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought these yesterday afternoon and have just opened them to make a snack to find loads of them have fur on. It clearly states that tomorrow is their use/sell by date. This is the second pack of blackberries in the last week this has happened to! And I also have blueberries just opened with a longer date which are also not up to standard. The quality of your fresh produce has drastically dropped in recent months and I m so disappointed as I have always remained loyal to Tesco despite the fierce competition between supermarkets. I would prefer to pay a little extra for better quality but it seems I m paying extra for not only poorer quality  but mouldy  completely inedible produce. Not impressed at all.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-0/s130x130/13892023_10153944490467632_7918963901139200356_n.jpg?oh=a1f59382c4fdc12efd766e389d40aeca&oe=58DC9A92	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-9/s720x720/13892023_10153944490467632_7918963901139200356_n.jpg?oh=ba18b9a99842246525eed9204af8433b&oe=58EBC19F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153944490467632&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-08T12:52:27+0000	1470660747	2016-08-08 14:52:27	2	7	3	0	10	7	4	3	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

Twice (this week and last week) I ve been in  and twice this week I ve been so distracted with other (not so good) stuff  that I ve left my change in the hopper. And each time your lovely staff has either stopped me and returned it or kept it and returned to me when I realised if left it! I m so grateful  as this week  the £5 I left in the hopper is all I have to last me until Sunday  and would have been devastated if I d got home and realised how much of an idiot I am. Thank goodness for honest staff  and please pass this on to the manager of the Murraygate Store.

I also had a terrible time trying to get any measurement of milk with each forkful of  wheat biscuit  and when I did  it dropped down my shirt. Thanks to your misleading information  I have now been cautioned at work for lateness and unkempt uniform! I would like to also take the time to warn others of the dangers of trying to eat cereal with a fork. The prongs are very sharp and although are more efficient at breaking the  wheat biscuits  into mouthful size chunks  do not offer adequate containment of any milk poured over the cereal! Tesco  I would like to know what you are going to do to prevent anyone else being heartbroken in this way and so everyone can enjoy their  wheat biscuits  in the morning without such a tragedy occurring as the traumatic experience I had this morning.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13912461_270958099952070_7810562065299634801_n.jpg?oh=d29e3247921d1e070bd03ee00d9ee3f3&oe=58ED0F82	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13912461_270958099952070_7810562065299634801_n.jpg?oh=9a19148cba830df18e6fed7767ff73f5&oe=591BE27D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=270958099952070&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-08T12:35:05+0000	1470659705	2016-08-08 14:35:05	7	6	12	1	19	4	2	2	13	0	7	0	0	5	0	0	0

Approximately 3 months ago I purchased a Tesco HBS16 Hand Blender to make the baby weaning process a little easier.  However the twist on lid that goes on the blender bowl is full of water. Every time it gets washed it becomes a little more filled with water.   Probably silly of me  but I didn t think much of it as it started as just a small amount - but now it is really full of water and leaks putrid smelling rusty water in to anything I am trying to chop.  As I was originally using the stick blender (which is brilliant) predominately to make purees and I guess I didn t use the chopper enough to worry but now I have been trying to use the chopper every day to make more solid food for baby it has now become a serious issue as like I ve said - food I do make now smells of horrid rusty water and I obviously can t use the item.  I have hand washed the item every time but no matter how I wash it it has become full of water and there is no way of draining it.   Is there anything that can be done please as I need one I can use every day and at the moment I am unwilling to use one with the potential of making my baby sick.  I look forward to hearing from you  Many thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13906727_10154354756764524_8325472030986484179_n.jpg?oh=cc57d5da392284d994abaa78b96a29b2&oe=591D5DEE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13906727_10154354756764524_8325472030986484179_n.jpg?oh=c2ea147233792f1c9cdf3d54c61f70a7&oe=5923E7E3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154354756764524&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-08T11:06:58+0000	1470654418	2016-08-08 13:06:58	0	5	0	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently placed an order for the Tesco Easy Entertaining range for a special party we were having on Saturday 6th Aug.  They ask that you give 3/4 days notice  more on some items when placing the order. I assumed that this was so they could ensure they had sufficient time to prepare my food.  Unfortunately  I was wrong. I received an email Fri evening  my delivery was booked for between 10pm and 11pm  to advise me that the mini classic cupcakes I d ordered were unavailable.  I spoke to customer service who said he would contact the dot com manager in the store who would ring me back.  He didn t  but the c/s advisor did to let me know there was a supplier issue and that I hadn t been charged. Really! I certainly would not expect to pay for something you couldn t supply.  My delivery arrived early and the driver was lovely  the only positive thing about this whole experience  but when checking my order we found that not only were the 36 classic cupcakes missing but so were 36 mini cupcakes and 60 mini savoury eggs. The driver was very apologetic  he knew nothing about the shortages  even though they are supposed to be advised.  Once again I had to ring customer service to complain. The girl I spoke to found it hard to believe there were no substitutes at all for the mini savoury eggs. I know I d ordered the value range but surely supplying the next price range up would have provided better customer service than sending nothing at all!  Saturday morning was spent trying to source 72 mini cupcakes and 60 mini savoury eggs  something that I had expected to prevent by ordering from the Easy Entertaining range.  Having successfully found the necessary items in Asda  I returned home to receive a phone call from my local Tesco to tell me the cupcakes had come in on the delivery that morning and were available if I wanted them. I told her  very politely  that I d had to get them elsewhere and that I wouldn t be using or recommending that service to anyone  ANYONE CONSIDERING ORDERING FROM THE EASY ENTERTAINING RANGE PLEASE BE AWARE THAT EVEN IF YOU PROVIDE TESCO WITH THE REQUIRED NOTICE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR ORDER!!!!!					2016-08-08T09:36:38+0000	1470648998	2016-08-08 11:36:38	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A couple of items in my shop had failed to scan in. Your service assistant was on her headset asking  what to do with a person like this . I believe the response was related to the item value and as my failures comprised a small tin of sardines and a pot of yoghurt (value probably less than £1.50) it was not taken further. Never again! What a humiliating experience! It seems I was also in trouble for putting a correctly scanned mascara into my shoulder bag so it did not get lost because it then wasn t in the trolley with everything else to check. I dread to think what might have happened to me had a higer value item mis-scanned  terrifying prospect!

Your Tesco own branded Milk says it supports British Farmers  is it supplied by Müller Wiseman? Who are currently refusing to pay the proper price to producers. If it is then your branding of Proudly Partnering with British Dairy Farmers is incorrect. As Müller are now buying from outside the UK.					2016-08-08T07:59:15+0000	1470643155	2016-08-08 09:59:15	3	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our Microwave from Tesco s caught fire when I say caught fire I mean flames/smoke and the most awful smell ever  it required a fire blanket etc to put out the flames..  But this could have been a much different post as my little boy was in the kitchen at the time..  I decided was gonna take my barely used microwave back to the store (Oak Tree Lane  mansfield) I had the but could I heck as like find the receipt  I have every receipt back to 2010 lol) Once in-store I explained the situation to Mel (Tech) he told me not to worry as customer service could track the transaction my club card history.. and phoned them for me-i explained the situation to customer service although they were helpful they said it would take up to two weeks to track the transaction.. I was a bit miffed but ok with this as I really just wanted Tesco to be aware there was an issue with this microwave.. especially given the fact it had also scorched my worktop on a 30 second bottle warm.  However Mel wasn t.. he looked over the microwave and was shocked/almost 4 days later the smell in-store was toxic from the microwave.  He said he was going to get the store manager and show him.. again the manager was shocked..  Mel said there was no way this should have happened and that if there was anything that could be done he d find it..  During my time in-store he listened.. was polite/knowledgeable and curtious and a true gentleman.  He understood that I d been uncomfortable about taking the item back but reassured me I d done the right thing..  In the end I did get a full refund on my microwave but opted to do some research before purchasing another microwave.  I think alot of staff and other stores learn alot from this guy..  Fabulous customer service!!  P.s. I have tried numerous times to write this review your website using the correct methods but It won t work/save???					2016-08-08T06:52:17+0000	1470639137	2016-08-08 08:52:17	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Some of these complaints must have the office in stitches and some with their head in their hands yet all responses are courteous  friendly and professional. Witty responses are always spot on and given when appropriate. If there was an Olympic Event for complaints responses then I m sure Tesco would win gold.

Todays visit was jaw dropping when I saw parents pushing a laughing teenager of about 14/15yrs sat in a trolley wearing skimpy shorts. I reported it to staff as I have done before who always shrug and say they can t do anything. Well I do not think this is allowed by health and safety and I don t wish to put my food where sweaty bums have been or dog mucked up shoes.

My phone suddenly broke and I was in need of a new one due to my husband having poor health  it was around 9pm and the phone department had closed at 8pm  daniel went out of his way to see if I was able to buy a phone which resulted in him phoning an off duty colleague for the code and accessing the keys. I was then able to purchase my phone and Daniel set it all up for me to ensure it worked with my sim before i left   so thanks once again Daniel  your a real gem! 😁 tesco should be proud to have you as part of the team					2016-08-07T22:19:47+0000	1470608387	2016-08-08 00:19:47	16	2	16	0	18	2	2	0	5	0	15	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today while out with three extremely grumpy and tired small people one that was running and running while needing to pee because she needed to so bad . We popped in to get a couple of bits for a birthday bbq  my partner promptly took the small running   weak bladdered child to the loo meanwhile two lovely staff members stopped me  my older daughter and my baby and offered fruit (banana  orange or Apple) my daughter picked a banana and asked for one for her sister and they didn t question it at all (probably a good thing because if the smaller one had seen the tray she would of wanted it all) they then proceeded to offer something for the baby unfortunately he has a lot of allergies and so couldn t have anything . However I genuinely thought it was a lovely touch and wanted to share my gratitude :).. So Thankyou again :)..					2016-08-07T20:59:50+0000	1470603590	2016-08-07 22:59:50	5	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our 3yr old Son had had enough of shopping & started to play up @ the till with him trying to play with the handheld scanner. So our Angel  Debbie  stepped up & got our Son involved with putting the shopping through the till. He was so happy & content & well behaved during this process it resulted in a positive shopping trip with happy  calm parents and happy memories for both Our Son & us. Wish there were more Debbie s.

Definitely will not be buying them again that s for definite.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13882087_316865408662577_4546263040157519312_n.jpg?oh=9f577f1dd6dfcaf7c4437f2a518b20ae&oe=591819F0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13882087_316865408662577_4546263040157519312_n.jpg?oh=678ec310d7b294b1191a8564b1d28268&oe=591F5F0F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=316865408662577&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-07T19:12:16+0000	1470597136	2016-08-07 21:12:16	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I feel so sorry for the people manning this page  how do you keep your calm under such circumstances?   I understand if you are doing online shopping and you get a short dated/past sell by date item in your delivery that you d be cross  but perhaps I m strange but when I take an item from the shelf  it takes me a split second to check the sell by/use by date and if it s past that date  I don t get my phone  take a pic  go home and rant on FB about possible death/ kidney failure/psychological scarring- I  politely take the expired item to a member of staff and let them know!  Be a human  give people a break  there are tens of thousands of lines in any supermarket and a packet of Paxo 1 day past its sell by date ain t going to kill you!					2016-08-07T19:09:51+0000	1470596991	2016-08-07 21:09:51	103	19	120	2	141	17	10	7	107	0	100	9	0	7	0	1	0

I had a phone call to say the delivery would be delayed by 30 minutes and that was okay. I then received a phone call at 16.40 to say the delivery had been cancelled and the store would have known this earlier today!!!! If my local store could have called me earlier today I could have done a click and collect or sourced food elsewhere. I feel totally let down by Tesco and you re £10 good will gesture doesn t cut it for me as its cost me more tonight in takeaway bills and petrol.					2016-08-07T19:00:33+0000	1470596433	2016-08-07 21:00:33	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We opened it this evening to make dinner only to find every slice  apart from 4  that had this black/brown sticky substance throughout it.  It doesn t smell of anything but if it was burnt it would have a charred smell and wouldn t be sticky like tar.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13939544_10154510650127022_3539379091087506106_n.jpg?oh=7cb099e59e7afb0ab988b437024b7c6e&oe=58DA9BDF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13939544_10154510650127022_3539379091087506106_n.jpg?oh=47cd9227dfe08a3fc77cd7b13b0f700f&oe=592351D2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154510650127022&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-07T18:16:09+0000	1470593769	2016-08-07 20:16:09	4	3	4	0	7	3	3	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Bad move. The Tesco  400g lasagne containing  no artificial preservatives  flavours or colours  (bar code 5 054775 860739) was a total waste of money. It tasted of nothing apart from a peculiar slightly bitter saccharine back note. It was awful muck. I ve put the pic there so people will recognise and avoid it. Who on earth tests these products and what is wrong with their palate?

As a family we have attended our local Tesco Wishaw for a number of years.  The quality of carrots and potatoes in the last 3-6months has dramatically plummeted!  The loose carrots are often too thin to use and rotten! The loose carrots used to be large  fresh and juicy! The potatoes are even worse  you peel them and they are black or brown inside and you end up throwing half the bag in the bin! You brand these products  Redmede Farms  and state  Fresh Quality  I suggest you seriously look at this supplier as these products are certainly not fresh or good quality! Here is a picture of prepackaged carrots purchased today which quite frankly is a joke!!  They are pencil thin and rotten!  Tesco carrots and potatoes previously were good quality but not anymore! I look forward to your comments	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13939564_1174800045919872_2803666196589487488_n.jpg?oh=cbc42a3c2d8f3e46e23876afbbaa2e4b&oe=58E7E77A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13939564_1174800045919872_2803666196589487488_n.jpg?oh=39cd54c91b7efca276e24eeb391f0604&oe=5924346F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1174800045919872&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-07T16:31:34+0000	1470587494	2016-08-07 18:31:34	1	15	2	0	17	14	6	8	6	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

In this sweltering heat they were refused a drink and told to go else where.  The men who didn t have the most appropriate clothing on for this weather due to cultural reasons were sweating  and clearly in desperate need of a drink!  No one should be refused the right for a drink regardless to whether the store is about to close or not.  Lucky enough there are kind people in this world like me...who lucky enough heard their plea and kindly gave them the two bottles I had just bought for me and my sister because we were thirsty ourselves. You should be ashamed of yourselves.					2016-08-07T15:28:41+0000	1470583721	2016-08-07 17:28:41	5	3	5	0	8	3	3	0	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in today after I bought Tesco s own Non Bio  Tesco loves baby  washing powder and Comforts non bio fabric conditioner. I am expecting my first baby on the 2nd of October and was excited to start washing all the baby clothes ready for the little one to arrive. I took all steps  first I run an empty wash and cleaned out the powder draw. I than washed all clothes and blankets  some were discoloured but I presumed it was because some of the white spit clothes have pink flowers on them. I than washed a second load  this time all brand new baby clothes. I used 1 cap of conditioner & 1 cap of Tesco s own washing powder. When I took this washing out all the clothes where discoloured with parts completely bleached meaning that every single item is now ruined. I went straight to Tesco Thornton Heath where I especially bought both products for the wash only  yesterday. Tesco s own product states on the back that it has bleaching agents  the fabric conditioner does not have such ingredients. My complaint was completely dismissed by the blonde lady in a red shirt (she didn t wear a name badge either  not ideal for working at your customer services desk!). First it was my dirty washing machine to which I explained that it s a 2 months old machine and that I run an empty wash and that the clothes got ruined on the 2nd load of washing! She than looked and the box of washing powder and said that it can t possibly be that and it must be the comfort fabric conditioner as it s  ultra concentrated . I showed her all the ruined clothes again and asked how it can be that using 1 cap of fabric conditioner leaves bleach marks on over 15 items? She than went on that maybe I should wash it again to which I than responded that this surly won t put the colour back. She than  typed up a note to Tesco customer services which she read to me asking if the information eas corect. It stared I was very distraught (which is true) and I was distraught because the Comfort conditioner spoilt my baby clothes (NOT true) as my complaint was about the washing powder in the first place which was complete dismissed  not once did the lady consider it is the Tesco product which has bleach in!!! I asked her to add to the text that I also used the washing powder which she didn t bother to do but just printed her own version of what happened and stuck it to the bottle of fabric conditioner. I was refunded both products and left with a bag of Brand new baby clothes for over £100 and left feeling like I must be a complete idiot with a clearly dirty washing machine or not being able to use a fabric conditioner properly. At no point did the customer service Representative even consider that maybe Tesco s own product could be the cause. A day that was due to be exciting for me and my husband  ready for our babies arrival has turned out to be a day full of tears and the need to go out and buy new clothes. Some of the clothes were bought on sale and can t be replaced without spending excessive amounts of money when buying your first baby equipment is so expensive already and we felt very happy to have managed to get some bargains. Very poor service from you Tesco  I doubt making me feel like a complete fool is the way to go about it 🙁.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13886868_10207059971913778_507372776027458538_n.jpg?oh=7924189e1ea8f3d87c700910f2c2481b&oe=591B0A0E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13886868_10207059971913778_507372776027458538_n.jpg?oh=6775775df80e0e4387655c16d3d88d71&oe=58E8C01B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207059971913778&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-07T14:43:02+0000	1470580982	2016-08-07 16:43:02	0	12	4	1	17	12	5	7	1	0	0	0	0	0	3	1	0

They said that they were sorry but they cannot take cash as they have a limit in their tills.  Since when can you not pay with cash be it notes but in this case pound coins for something that you wish to but from Tesco.

I visited Tesco great notley and after the disappointing service I had received from debenhams I had no other option but to buy some flowers from Tesco. I grabbed 3 bunches and needed them to look good I took this to the tills and I must say the staff are so helpful and tried they best to make them into a big bouquet and I m was so grateful for they help. The names of the ladies who helped me were Emma and Sarah in the customer service and I just thought I would bring this to your attention.					2016-08-07T13:51:54+0000	1470577914	2016-08-07 15:51:54	4	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

My thought process was the food would indeed be re arrange in an isle with normal food..but no  staff unsure..of course it s over the other side of the store and now lives amongst seasonal goods..tents lawn mowers etc..totally bemused Not only that the product range is dismally reduced...from before....I would like to know what was the theory of the product placement logic for this move to a totally non food area?...so many customers must be loosing out trying to find the products.					2016-08-07T13:44:36+0000	1470577476	2016-08-07 15:44:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

WRONG! After one month the liner developed a fault so I called and was told they had no replacements in stock. I said all I needed was the liner replacing ( which you do have in stock online). I was told that it would be too costly for tesco and I d have to wait for Layz spa to restock them instead. If I knew how utterly useless you would be I would have just purchased it straight from the manufacturer or somewhere with half decent service. What is the point of seeling things when you offer no warranty!?					2016-08-07T13:24:33+0000	1470576273	2016-08-07 15:24:33	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I find it unbelievable that a big company like yours doesn t comply with RSPCA and Rabbit welfare association guidelines. Rabbits are the single most abused pet in the uk  and you are simply perpetuating this by selling cruel housing. Complying with the rabbit association guidelines for housing (RWAF) would do a lot for your standing in the responsible pet owners community. RWAF has named and shamed you this morning for selling cruel housing. As a big retailer you should be setting a good example. Shame on you.					2016-08-07T12:44:23+0000	1470573863	2016-08-07 14:44:23	5	4	5	1	10	4	4	0	3	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

For one I applaud you for allowing long passwords but why enforce using upper  lower  number  and special character. This does nothing in terms of security  its all about length (tell your security team to read about password entropy) and they will soon realise that having random characters does not make a difference!  Not only that  the reset password is only allowed if you have 3 of the following and not all four! Crazy!.  Plus once ive gotten a very weird password which I know ill never remember (I will just have to reset again) it says im not entering a valid postcode! So unable to proceed.   Unfortuantely because of this im unable to log in and wont be making a delievery order which is really dissapointing.  Hopefully you can pass this onto the web team so they can fix the bug pronto.

Unfortunate to have been turned away from Tesco Express Royal Avenue store (by an extremely rude security guard) ten minutes before it closed. Reason given....the store was too busy and there were only 2 members of staff working. Now.....I am not a genius....but I feel that scheduling more than two members of staff for the day (considering that the store is the closest to the gay quarter in the city)  may have supported customers better.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13921061_10157315219630445_881851607495881884_n.jpg?oh=113d1f2ef165e6931e30ce0bbbb2bb6e&oe=58E93E03	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/13913684_10157315219630445_881851607495881884_o.jpg?oh=af936f9cff56fe3f3a78c23c080e1078&oe=58D86CD3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157315219630445&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-07T09:50:59+0000	1470563459	2016-08-07 11:50:59	1	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

We are staying at my brother in laws house for a week in London and ordered a Tesco delivery (order number 900614632) for our arrival yest.  When we arrived  the Tesco delivery van was sitting waiting for us  a couple of minutes early as he had just delivered somewhere else on this street.   There are no polite words to describe the facetious neighbour who was harassing the delivery driver. He was out in arms complaining to all who would listen about how the delivery driver dared park almost in front of his drive (although he wasn t going anywhere) and how the almost silent sound from the van  that was keeping our goods chilled  dared ruin five minutes of his evening.  I am writing to you as i know that the neighbour took photos to write you a strongly worded letter of complaint  you may as well return to sender as this driver was polite  courteous and gave great service that didn t deserve any of the harassment he was receiving.  We are sorry the lovely guy had to deal with such a Tommy Tanker.					2016-08-07T09:49:39+0000	1470563379	2016-08-07 11:49:39	24	5	25	0	30	5	3	2	4	0	23	1	0	0	0	0	0

Because profit is more important than compassion? Because people don t need to see the truth?! Your  dairy  campaign is repulsive as it is pure rubbish.					2016-08-06T20:43:55+0000	1470516235	2016-08-06 22:43:55	2	11	2	0	13	10	6	4	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Already complained to customer services and I ve been told that it should be with me by 8:20 at the latest. I m 22 weeks pregnant and I want to go to bed  I m really tired. I delayed my children going to bed so the noise of the delivery wouldn t wake them up but I ve had to take them to bed as they are exhausted. What is going on with your delivery service  it s gone so downhill recently.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13920755_1770109273268628_2512424364780276150_n.jpg?oh=8aae73fd1de5db7a584b72e2740e1fbc&oe=58E04C12	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13920755_1770109273268628_2512424364780276150_n.jpg?oh=fff2fedaaf62aa1ebecf7680d8e970d8&oe=58EBA007	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1770109273268628&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-06T19:57:43+0000	1470513463	2016-08-06 21:57:43	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Unfortunately organisation is not a good word to describe Tesco.  After our order did not arrive in the allotted time  with no phone call to notify us   I phoned - during this call the operator could not get hold of the driver and said she would call me back in 15 minutes.  She didn t  we chased  she called to say the store would call  they haven t  we chased  have been told that the driver is probably  out of time   would have to go back to Penzance  reload the vans and someone else bring it out   ETA  who knows? .  My husband has now gone out to buy some food for tonight (whilst missing the Olympic cycling).  Still waiting for order - clearly will come as soon as we sit down to eat.  Have received a £10 online order voucher in my inbox ... Well we can t eat that and do I really want to stay in for the hours it would take to have anything delivered from Tesco ever again....  Just had a phone call from the store.  The van has returned and there is no food order on it  they don t know where it is....					2016-08-06T17:47:31+0000	1470505651	2016-08-06 19:47:31	0	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0

I was shopping in the Yeovil store this morning using the scan and shop system. When I got to the scan and shop check out at roughly 10am the system told me that my shopping had been selected to be checked. Fine  no problem  or so I thought! The operator came over scanner in hand to check my shopping  she scanned a few items  then said she needed to check her scanner as something hadn t scanned  no problem  the operator came back and scanned again  then said that there was a problem and asked me to move my trolley over. The operator then said that she was going to have to scan the entire shop  didn t explain why  no problem  I thought. When unpacking my shop  I noticed that a tray of potatoes had split  I asked if I could change them and was told  go and find them yourself  so I did. When I returned to the scan and shop checkout  the operator was stood with another colleague and they were both looking at me very oddly. The operator who had checked my shop  then announced in a VERY loud voice that I had over £27 of shopping that had not scanned. The operator then turned to her colleague and said again very loudly  What happens now? Do I need to call security?  I was absolutely mortified. I had no idea how this had happened. I tried to explain that I scanned every single item  however this was sniffed at. When I suggested the possibility that the scanner I had used might be faulty  I was told that this couldn t possibly be the case as the operator was using my scanner. This actually wasn t the case as she had arrived with the scanner in her hand. I tried to point this out but again was cried down and made to feel like I was a criminal. It was awful  so embarrassing with other shoppers staring. I have no idea what happened with my shopping  it has never happened before and will never happen again as I will never be returning to shop at Tesco again. I have cut up my club card. It was an absolutely hideous experience. To add insult to injury  when I returned home and unpacked my shopping  the operator had obviously dropped a large tub of yoghurt whilst repacking it when I had gone to get find the tray of potatoes because the bottom had split and yoghurt had gone all over the rest of my shopping in the bag.					2016-08-06T17:32:55+0000	1470504775	2016-08-06 19:32:55	0	13	0	3	16	7	2	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This was only delivered this morning and it s best before tomorrow. I only buy a half portion as it takes me a few days to get thru it... not a few hours!!  To me  the odd bruised banana is part of risk of getting groceries fresh produce delivered - but this is just poor quality control. It s almost as if you use your delivery service as a way of getting rid of all your  past their best  products.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13912640_10154214548185791_1918281440954858555_n.jpg?oh=d071324b4fd24d31e7624e7287947225&oe=58E43F9C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13912640_10154214548185791_1918281440954858555_n.jpg?oh=948909a480b7e609939ad1746ce58230&oe=58E5AC91	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154214548185791&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-06T17:15:28+0000	1470503728	2016-08-06 19:15:28	1	10	1	0	11	10	4	6	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought - at last  finally Tesco have come up with something to beat Aldi s free spider with bananas offer.  I excitedly shouted the kids downstairs to come and meet our new pet. We decided to name him William. Our new pet appeared to be very unresponsive  we just put it down to him being sleepy and decided to give him sometime to come round.  24 hours later and William still hasn t moved  on closer inspection he seems quite flat (again see picture) and I think he may be dead. Well...I m no vet but I think the tight shrink wrap on the cucumber may have squashed and killed William.  I know Aldi s Banana spiders were deadly but at least they had some life in them.  I now have three very upset children  a worm funeral to plan and to top it all off I ve totally lost my taste for cucumber sandwiches which as everyone knows are a favourite at any wake.  So come on Tesco wiggle your way out of this one!?!?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13962576_1256528577711069_5067803706647520459_n.jpg?oh=38b81bd95ba8ef4d22f30000590d35c8&oe=59210DB8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13962576_1256528577711069_5067803706647520459_n.jpg?oh=c3bc8145b564d3a4b88a15de8045aeb8&oe=58DC46AD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1256528577711069&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-06T12:53:08+0000	1470487988	2016-08-06 14:53:08	70798	24225	91588	45475	161288	19904	14269	5635	139113	0	69864	1908	263	18085	122	47	0

I never usually take him because he hates shopping and sitting in the trolley but had no choice today. Before we had  even walked in to Tesco he decided to throw a temper tantrum I then succeeded in getting him into the trolley and started shopping walking past the free fruit for children (brilliant idea). My son almost fell out the trolley in his temper even though I had strapped him in he had pulled himself free. He then wanted mummy cuddles and when I tried to put him down again to walk he just wanted to get back up. I was almost in tears by this point and about to give up shopping all together go home and go hungry (no food in the house) it was so busy being a Saturday and lots of shoppers had walked past watching me struggle. Then Steph came to my recuse she had been handing out the free fruit and witnessed everything she dropped what she was doing and pushed my trolley around the store for me so that I could carry my son  she spoke to him and claimed him down and entertained him while we walked round. She even offered to put my shopping on the till and pack it for me by this point my son had calmed down and become his usual playful self. Steph went above and beyond and this one small act of kindness had such an impact on our day  I can t express how much I appreciated her help  Tesco you have an amazing employee. Thank you Steph					2016-08-06T12:06:33+0000	1470485193	2016-08-06 14:06:33	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve 14 people for a dinner party this evening and had placed a large online order to be delivered this morning. Delivery was very prompt but after the driver had left I realised I was missing some items. I rang customer support who were fab  they passed the issue to the store who were then brilliant. They kept me posted and the missing goods have just been delivered along with two amazing desserts to say sorry and to wish me a great evening tonight. Thank you to Sue and the team. Great service and a happy customer. 😃😃😃					2016-08-06T11:48:25+0000	1470484105	2016-08-06 13:48:25	5	3	5	0	8	3	1	2	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also  why is the fruit hardly ever on offer? yet if you want a chocolate bar you can get 2 for a £. Sorry but It s asda from now on - It may cost more in petrol to get to carlisle but at least my fruit won t be off by the time i get home!					2016-08-06T11:39:41+0000	1470483581	2016-08-06 13:39:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I cannot drive due to the vast amount of meds I have to take  in the last 6 weeks i have been let down  lied to  and brushed off 5 out of 6 times!! Thats an 83% failure rate!! I ordered my shopping to be delivered last night between 10-11pm  its gets to 11:10pm  I try to ring to ask where my shopping is  Conveniently the lines shut at 11pm so no joy there. I ring at the earliest opportunity this morning to be told I was contacted yesterday to notify me of a problem and a message was left   THIS IS A LIE !! then a very unfriendly and unhelpful Angela (MA10 is her ID code I believe) tells me that the best she is willing to do is reschedule for tomorrow lunchtime. Should I starve until then as I cannot drive to any shops? Should I be a PRIORITY as it was YOU who FAILED yet again? Its bad enough having your life turned upside down  spending 6 months in hospital  being in a coma for 2 of the 6 months  enduring chemo and radio therapy  but talk about being kicked while you are down !! I previously shopped at the Culverhouse cross store and was always extremely happy with the service  especially a few key people helping me with shopping and getting to and from my car when I could drive (Mel from scan and shop deserves a mention) but was unable to walk. Your level of service has spiralled downwards !! I was under the impression your slogan is  Every little helps  ? My question is ...HOW ARE YOU HELPING A LOYAL CUSTOMER BY LEAVING THEM TO STARVE KNOWING THEY CANNOT SHOP WITHOUT YOUR DELIVERY SERVICE?? IS THAT THE LITTLE BIT THATS HELPING ME ? I THINK NOT !!. I look forward to your response and how you intend to rectify this issue knowing you and your staff are happily kicking someone while they are down!  P.s. it says on my online orders that you have delivered my shopping !!! PRICELESS !!!					2016-08-06T11:28:50+0000	1470482930	2016-08-06 13:28:50	0	3	2	1	6	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0

As I was eating it I noticed it was quite dry and then looked at the cake to discover mould growing on it. In horror I ve grabbed the box and it states it went off on the 28th of July (yet your Thornton heath store still has them on the shelf a WEEK later!) Appalling. Will be going down to the store shortly to make a massive complaint (receipt and cake in hand)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13892032_554119931453821_7034232620879605979_n.jpg?oh=79e58112c5bea7e48a612759abc207d5&oe=591CE3C6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13892032_554119931453821_7034232620879605979_n.jpg?oh=268011fa6b9abe77adb56a10f73d3395&oe=59221039	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=554119931453821&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-06T10:46:18+0000	1470480378	2016-08-06 12:46:18	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	7	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

After a late(ish) night  no alcohol involved  not a very good sleep then an early rise to drop eldest child off at his Uncle s in Falkirk I decided to do my weekly shop whilst I was out and about. One takeaway coffee in my hand and I find myself in the vegetable aisle staring at the produce. A lovely member of staff approached me (apologies  didn t get her name - still half asleep) and asked me if I was okay before offering to do my shopping for me.  Bless her. Giving myself a shake I declined her kind offer. Further round the store I couldn t find an item I was looking for and your Australian/NZ colleague (sorry  don t know her name either) came to my rescue having had less sleep than I had (we had a blether).  Eventually deciding I had finished my shopping I was served by Chris at the checkout and his usual chatty  friendly manner finally woke me up :-) The point of this post I hear you ask....well  I just want to highlight how helpful and friendly the staff at the store are. I believe appreciation goes a long way and I d be very happy if you could pass on my thanks to a great team.					2016-08-06T10:35:04+0000	1470479704	2016-08-06 12:35:04	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Arla do a lovely product which is enhanced and enriched with vitamins for added health benefits similar to that of the goodness of baby milk! I can only buy Arla  Big Milk  in the larger superstores. Monday I did my big shop and purchased a 4pt which we generally get through in 3/4 days even though it guaranteed freshness for up to a week! I m disappointed to realise that you often overstock this milk and so often have loads left near expiry dates near the front which will NOT have the 7 days life that Arla promise to give just like cravendale. I ve learnt to normally check the dates on your stock! However having just moved house I just grabbed and haven t looked. I m disappointed to see that I bought the milk on 1st August yet realised a few days after use on my family it expired 29th July! Well passed the sell before date! I m really disappointed in your service. This is a product aimed at young children aged 1-5 which is even more scary! They don t have as good an immune system. I don t just want a replacement or refund I d urge you as a company to rethink your stock take on such an item as there s clearly not a high demand for the item yet its required so maybe don t have crates of the stuff which enables the dates to get close or even surpass! Stock rotation is highly important on young children s items.

Driver of BN12 SXJ just used his van to force his way across our vehicle  nearly taking our family car out on the A121 roundabout near Waltham Abbey.  He changed lanes twice on the slip road then cut across us from the outside forcing us into an emergency stop. He exited the roundabout towards the Wake Arm s roundabout.

We were in one of your glasgow branches(Parkhead) last week and for the first time in months  they had Mango Zero and Orange Zero fizzy drinks. No other branch in the city seems to ever stock them (or the pink lemonade) anymore. I was so happy I bought loads with the intention of going back for more. Now we went back last night  and there wasn t a sign for any of them. We tried Parkhead forge  St Rollox  Shettleston and Maryhill to no luck. These are my favourite juices out there  and I ve managed to find them once in about 4 months. I asked before and was told they would be back soon. I was kinda hoping that  back  would be for longer than one delivery lol What is actually happening with them? I can see them on the groceries app but when I log in they disappear!  Help me Tesco  you re my only hope!					2016-08-06T09:35:33+0000	1470476133	2016-08-06 11:35:33	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However today was the last day. Aldi opened a few months ago and I ll be honest I shop between the 2 stores but there are a few things I can only get in tesco. Last year you stopped selling the only flour I use so I now have to source it from at least 15 miles away. Then I m not sure what has happened but the fondant is different and not as good as it used to be. And then I go in this morning to but flower modeling paste to find you no longer sell it. How do you decide what products to sell?? There are items in the baking section which I see regularly go to clearance as they don t sell yet a product which I know a few people in this small town buy can no longer be purchased. Well done tesco I now have no reason to pop into your store!!					2016-08-06T08:53:42+0000	1470473622	2016-08-06 10:53:42	2	7	2	0	9	7	3	4	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was much to big for just me and my husband - it was tied in 4 places. I was staggered to be told they would cut it in half but I d have to buy both pieces. I just walked away quite upset as this has never happened before and I left paying for the shopping  I had as the incentive to shop was gone. i felt quite upset if not a little humiliated by the whole experience. Are you now limiting your fresh meat sales to families only?					2016-08-06T08:31:01+0000	1470472261	2016-08-06 10:31:01	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son had an accident and fell over and banged his head. The staff that helped  were a lovely man and young woman who could not do enough to help us. From giving my son 1st aid and offering him a drink to helping me charge my phone and even helping me to get to the bus station. Carrying my shopping and making sure we got on the bus safely and even paid for us to get home. Thank u so much we appreciated your kindness and thoughtful help. ☺					2016-08-05T23:26:42+0000	1470439602	2016-08-06 01:26:42	2	7	2	0	9	7	2	5	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We went to self scan and one of the colleagues come to confirm my age for the wine. She asked what it was we had that needed confirming  I replied with it being just the wine and showed her the bottle to which she shouted  NO  at me after looking me up and down. Pretty confused and shocked I replied with that I have my ID and went rummaging into my bag for my purse  pretty embarrassed as the woman had shouted it so loud it had brought attention from other shoppers. Before I could get my ID out she pressed confirm and walked away muttering something to herself that I couldn t hear.  I work in a Sainsburys myself and I m fully aware of the think 25 policy that most supermarkets hold. Despite the sheer rudeness from the member of staff I found it more shocking that she didn t physically take my ID to look at after causing such a scene. I m 20 years old and I think I look quite young for my age  and obviously being 20 I qualify to be asked for ID under the think 25 policy so it s quite worrying thinking that things like this are happening in this store!					2016-08-05T22:17:15+0000	1470435435	2016-08-06 00:17:15	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was too late for dinner so I figured one of your fine meal deals would suffice. Unfortunately I was hit with the dilemma of either cheese and tomato or cheese and pickle. Turns out the decision was too much and I opted for the cheese triple to have the best of both worlds. I m not a fan of cheese and onion (the third part of the triple) but I guess that s the price I had to pay for being so indecisive.  Anyways  back to the story! Got home and sat down to tuck into my sandwich - seems such a petty thing to be excited about on a Friday night but I ve got no shame in how much I m loving pickle just now!   I have attached a photo of said sandwich and have a few issues - numero uno  cheese to bread ratio is pretty shocking! But also... Where s the pickle at?! Looks like someone had dropped a bit on the counter and had ran out of kitchen roll to wipe it up.   I d like this to be addressed with the utmost seriousness and I look forward to hearing from you. Also  if you have a staff member who is as passionate about cheese sandwiches as I am and who can truly empathise with my problem then please forward this along so we can work together to build a better world with better cheese and pickle sandwiches!

Unfortunately  I didn t get her name but I believe she was a checkout supervisor. I was visiting the store with my 9 week old daughter and she was getting quite upset as I queued to pay. This lovely lady came over to see if I was ok and did her best to distract my little girl and get her to smile. She had no luck so instead offered to pack my bags whilst I comforted her. I was so grateful and it meant I was able to keep my little one calm until I paid.  This member of staff had such patience and was so kind  she s a credit to your business.					2016-08-05T20:42:19+0000	1470429739	2016-08-05 22:42:19	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was driving into one of the disabled spaces from one side when a fiat 500 sped into it from the other and I had to move to the next space down. The owner didn t have a blue badge and when she got out the car was wearing a Tesco uniform. I then saw her working in the store obviously just starting her shift Shame on you Tesco for allowing your staff to use disabled spaces when there are plenty of spaces available just not so close to the door😤😤😤😤					2016-08-05T20:11:16+0000	1470427876	2016-08-05 22:11:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Saturday we were offered it as soon as we walked into North Harbour Portsmouth store. And then yesterday we went to the new store on Pompey centre  both my boys had a banana  I done my shopping and as per usual the youngest had a meltdown  one of your staff was straight over and offered him another banana which I said oh no he has already had one but she brushed me off and gave him another.

I then got home took my medication only to find an hour later when i started to feel worse they d given me the wrong type  which I had a reaction to. 👍🏻 ruined my weekend  wasted hours of my time and money I would not recommend anyone visit a Tesco pharmacy after this experience. Poor service is one thing but giving someone the wrong medication is disgusting and potentially lethal to someone s health.					2016-08-05T20:02:56+0000	1470427376	2016-08-05 22:02:56	0	6	2	0	8	6	2	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0

The quality was so poor we ended up having to come home early because the tent leaked when it started to rain. On returning my husband posted a very true and honest review of the tent on your website which was instantly removed by tesco.......sad and disappointed by the whole experience. Why take down honest reviews?? Perhaps addressing the problem would be more business savvy. Especially on the current financial climate.					2016-08-05T18:51:19+0000	1470423079	2016-08-05 20:51:19	0	8	0	0	8	8	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And this mini bus parked there instead. It s an elderly care one (so should have been in one of the many amd closer disabled spots available). Not thst they should have as two people who clearly work for the company as neither were elderly or disabled as far as I could see (myself being disabled but not visible to others)  however they happily jumped out of their high seats and strolled off to the store.  Of course you can also see that they are really far out of the spot too which is a hazard. I then parked in a non child spot with my two young children and took this photo and one of their number plate  course I wont post that on here  and went to customer service and explained to the young dark haired lady about it and asked her to get them moved along. She took the number plate but did NOTHING!!!! I was in the store for a good hour and not once were they called to customer services. I walked past her 5 mins after I went to her and she just stared at me.  Why take the details if you don t intend to do anything. What s the point of having these spots if when something like this is reported you re not gonna ask them to move. If i was parking in a disabled spot without a badge I d have been told right off. If I d parked longer than 3 hours I d have received a fine. Why not take car of the parent and child spots????   This is simply NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!!  Please sort out your staff or i will simply move along to Sainsburys for my shopping.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13920740_10153880636788727_7778997041461002924_n.jpg?oh=8ab27f6589065cce9983928058bc1bf9&oe=58DDEF94	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13920740_10153880636788727_7778997041461002924_n.jpg?oh=8eeab66cdb7a64a1877d972c9a4fcc02&oe=58E7BE99	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153880636788727&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-05T18:45:52+0000	1470422752	2016-08-05 20:45:52	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I d fancied a cream tea while I waited for cam to get dropped off but they had no clotted cream. I went to buy a small tub but they didn t have any in the main shop only a massive one which I couldn t justify.   I went back to the cafe for a scone and cuppa and joked about the size of the clotted cream pot  resigned to having a fruit scone and a cuppa.   Kieran then appeared with one of the large pots and told me to use as much as I needed and he d use the rest. It s a small gesture but has had a made my day. Not just the clotted cream but the thoughtfulness if the gesture. Thanks Kieran. 😀	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13912681_10154983935134068_197149846204143712_n.jpg?oh=abb666478690c1e07160c1d550731b6e&oe=58DA8EBB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/13912681_10154983935134068_197149846204143712_n.jpg?oh=2261d791835cc33c8a843ca3bfc5c387&oe=58E59ECB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154983935134068&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-05T18:10:33+0000	1470420633	2016-08-05 20:10:33	3	6	3	0	9	6	4	2	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went in to exchange faulty headphones complete with receipt.  I was informed by Matt the Electrical Manager that he would happily exchange them but I would have to pay £10 price difference as they had been on offer when I had purchased them!! Refused to do so and went to speak to the duty manager (Sharon?) who left  me waiting for over 20 mins and then only to be told she was unavailable to speak to me as she was in a meeting and would ring me later!! Her time is obviously far more precious than mine as an unhappy customer! Head Office have told me to go back in and they should exchange them for me at no additional cost. Great customer service Tesco!!!					2016-08-05T15:57:29+0000	1470412649	2016-08-05 17:57:29	0	4	0	1	5	4	2	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought my daughter a two-figure Peppa Pig toy set whilst shopping. Once finished and putting the trolley back one toy was missing. Somehow my daughter had lost it and a member of staff sorting the trollies (Malachai) helped me to look for it. We couldn t find it so I said don t worry and thank you for trying. He then said that we could go in and get another. I said don t worry wasn t necessary but he insisted. We went to where I originally got the toy set but there were none left of that particular one  Malachai then suggested another set  which was actually bigger than the original. He said we needed to go to the customer service desk so I just assumed he would ask it to be given as a good will gesture. Malachai actually wanted to pay for the toy himself! I am so incredibly grateful to him and the kindness he showed myself and my daughter. He is an invaluable member of your team and an outstanding human being. He showed compassion and care and has left me feeling very touched. It was a small act of kindness that has had a great impact.   Tesco please reward him and pass on the kindness to him as he has shown to me. Thank you.  Helen					2016-08-05T15:12:06+0000	1470409926	2016-08-05 17:12:06	1	1	1	1	3	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Promoting healthy eating is so important. Well done Tesco. Perhaps now more offers on fresh fruit and veg (wonky veg boxes for example?) and fewer offers on junk food. I see too many kids at school eating tubes of Pringles for lunch (and breakfast!!) because they are on offer at the supermarket next door and cheaper than a healthy option.					2016-08-05T13:12:36+0000	1470402756	2016-08-05 15:12:36	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went to your express store next to Glasgow Central station and bought 2 packs of cafe creme blue cigars. One packet was fine but I was sold and empty packet? Cause I was in a rush I didn t think to check they where full  which I wouldn t usually do anyway.					2016-08-05T12:59:17+0000	1470401957	2016-08-05 14:59:17	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called the number for my local store to check stock (as i live 2 miles away and don t drive). I was told that there was 8 bags in stock so took my chance and walked down with my 1 and 3 year old. When I got there I checked the obvious places to no avail and proceeded to customer services where I was greeted by a helpful staff member who checked the system  agreed the instock number and came with me to the location suggested on the system. But nope. No sand! The guy then offered to look out the back where he says he roped two others into looking but still no play sand! Much to the disappointment of my 3 year old and frustrating for myself we left empty handed and walked the two miles home again.   Now I am not entirely sure how you lose 80 kilos of sand but I was incredibly annoyed after the excursion and left feeling I had completely wasted my time! Cheers for that Tesco 😩					2016-08-05T12:19:34+0000	1470399574	2016-08-05 14:19:34	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently picked 5 totally different style tops from the F&F range but none of them were available in my size  despite them not being in the sale and trying several branches. I was also unable to find any of the 5 tops online and rang the main customer service line where a very unhelpful  lady told me she could not use the style numbers or bar codes I had copied down. The branches were also unable to help me due to a new I.T system which is not as good as the previous one. I realise it is my fault that I am fat but I am told my staff and am aware with my own eyes that stores receive batches of each style with lots of 10 s  12 s and 14 s and very few of the larger sizes. There may be as little as 2 size 20 s for example in each delivery. As the majority of women are size 16 and over and the sale racks are full of the smaller sizes which are unsold  is it time that the powers that be who order sizes into stores increase the number of larger sizes?!					2016-08-05T10:40:59+0000	1470393659	2016-08-05 12:40:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was told at the time it wasn t on the system so I couldn t have it. You contected me and said that things had been sorted with the store.  Yesterday I went back  picked up the same colouring book - and guess what? Yep it wouldn t scan!   To be fair the lady on the till got a manager who brought a different books (same type  different colour) and scanned that so I could take the book. But all this took time and shouldn t have happened. Why put things on the shelves if we can t buy them? - and having had it taken off me last week  why was it back?  Glad I now have it  but not happy about the hoops I have had to jump through to get it!					2016-08-05T10:34:03+0000	1470393243	2016-08-05 12:34:03	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The trip started off so well  she was playing peekaboo  laughing and giggling at people passing the trolley. The as we approached the biscuit aisle  she went pale and projectile vomited everywhere! And when I say everywhere I mean  down herself  in the trolley  in the shopping bag underneath her full of shopping  her coat and her changing bag hanging underneath her on the little hooky thing.....upon picking her up out the trolley  she was sick again...even worse! It Hit all previous places and then my jeans  my top and managed to find its way in my trainers. At first I was calm thinking someone would offer to help whilst I stripped her down  they didn t  (I can understand why  the amount of sick was a phenomenon - shes tiny - where it all came from I ve no idea!) I managed to grab a lady and ask her to get someone to help me. Her husband ran off to get someone and she stayed with me until he arrived. (Thank you lovely lady  I was genuinely panicking by this point!) The poor lad had no idea what he was about to walk into  he asked if I was Ok...I burst into tears  he immediately stepped up.  Michael  got me some baby wipes  and sent someone else off to get a bucket and began to unpack the sick covered shopping and listed what was there so he could get me new items. Primrose still naked at this point apart from a nappy because Mum of the Year award goes to me forgetting to pack a change of clothes  Michael notices and calls a Manager  Kevin  immediately who tells me to go upstairs and pick anything I wanted to put Primrose in. Through my tears and sobbing on the phone to my other half at this point I pick something for her  changed her and headed downstairs again. I was greeted by a trolley of fresh shopping  Michael and another Manager John. He managed to get a smile out of Primrose and more sobbing out of me! He told me Michael would finish my shopping with me  and he did. He pushed the trolley  grabbed and bleeped the shopping until we were finished and my other half appeared! (I d begged him to come help me because I was having a mental breakdown!) after leaving Tesco I called my Mum and had another breakdown for being so stupid at not being able to keep it together! But genuinely owe Michael and the other staff at Tesco a massive thank you and I will be sending a letter to head office to inform them of their amazing team!!  You have an amazing team at Hookwood  they were attentive  helpful  calming and most of all friendly and reassuring. I am yet to find out this young mans surname so I can send him a little thank you. So if you could help me do this it would be fantastic as Customer services didn t seem to know.  Truly the best customer service I ve ever received.  Thank you again.  Louise & a very sicky Primrose! x					2016-08-05T10:04:05+0000	1470391445	2016-08-05 12:04:05	5	5	7	0	12	5	4	1	2	0	5	2	0	0	0	0	0

My mother has received this through the post hear in England where we still currently use £ sterling. She did not realise at the time she tried to use it in our local shop. Instead of accepting the coupon and putting it through manually the lady was dismissive and quite frankly a little rude. ( this does not reflect the whole of the colleagues in our local shop most of them are lovely. It was just this one colleague).  Upon returning home she tried to phone tour not so helpful help desk where she was cut off twice.  Is there anything you can do to help rectify the situation please?

Recently my father sadly died and Mum and Dad s club card is in his name. So this was on the long list of people to advise. Obviously we went to the bank first and your club card was further down the list of priority.  My dad died of mesothelioma which is a cancer brought on by asbestos  which in the eyes of the law is not like other cancers and is classed as unnatural death and therefore we have to go through an inquest. This is obviously upsetting as in our case it won t tell us anything we don t already know and the Coroner Officer has advised us that effectively this is a form filling exercise which will just take time.  Why am I telling you this? This means that at present we only have two interim death certificates  unlike death certificates you cannot buy more  although we have got certified copies from the Solicitor.  Mum contacted Tesco club card and we have experienced two problems:  First  Tesco club card does not accept interim death certificates. We had no problems with the Bank who accepted it immediately and the joint accounts have immediately changed and the sole accounts are in the process of being changed  so no need to wait for the death certificate.  Second  once we have the death certificate (dad died on 7 July and the Coroner Officer advised yesterday that she was hopeful we would get it by the end of September) you apparently don t accept a certified copy. Therefore  we have to send an original which we will have to purchase.  I trust you understand that at this upsetting time your policy actually make the process worse.  How is it that Banks will firstly accept interim death certificates and secondly accept certified copies and you don t?					2016-08-05T07:01:20+0000	1470380480	2016-08-05 09:01:20	0	5	0	2	7	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Which to his surprise turned out to be a piece of WOOD! Not only was this an unenjoyable experience but could have imposed to be quite a safety risk  especially with the younger generation such as my 3 year old son who on occasions is allowed to enjoy a small helping of this product.   Is this the best we can expect from a Tesco finest product?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13939599_10210171004971140_4103596175155878979_n.jpg?oh=6d1ed272d27c456fc024e62778a1f27e&oe=58DC4D96	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13939599_10210171004971140_4103596175155878979_n.jpg?oh=d4d4dda3c47ec85dfb16dd002be9dc89&oe=58DC459B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210171004971140&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-04T21:43:01+0000	1470346981	2016-08-04 23:43:01	2	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a delivery booked for this morning and whilst unloading the driver and myself noticed the security tag still on a bottle.  The driver (van 8B/7341) then asked if I was in all day. He then told me he would get it taken off and deliver it back to me on his way home from work! I feel this driver deserves some recognition as he went above and beyond today!  Please let me know his name or publish this post to him as not enough people get the thanks they often deserve.

But why do you have to make us Aussies suffer too?!   First my Tim Tams and now my vegemite. You guys used to be my salvation  my saving grace  my home away from home. Since the Aussie stored in Covent Garden closed a few years back I have absolutely nowhere else to buy my these tasty delicacies from.   Is this your way of trying to reduce non-EU migration?  I didn t even mind paying your hugely inflated prices as they are imported after all. I never once complained when you tried to substitute a penguin for a Tim Tam.   But to take away your entire Aussie food range is paramount to racism!!  Please  I m begging you to bring back my Tim Tams and Vegemite (you can keep the BBQ Shapes - I never was much of a fan) and keep us immigrants happy!!  Kind regards  Fiona A proud Australian  ps. I heard Australia is first in line to agree a new trade deal with the UK following Brexit. Perhaps you could consider brining back a wider range of Aussie foodstuff then. I ve got a few recommendations to include if you re interested.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13882703_10154209836060791_5803973929466379808_n.jpg?oh=cf7f87108d414f550241309deb31c70f&oe=59206AB3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13882703_10154209836060791_5803973929466379808_n.jpg?oh=cdbf564005f6531ca2b21ad7005eb50c&oe=58D871BE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154209836060791&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-04T20:42:02+0000	1470343322	2016-08-04 22:42:02	6	4	7	0	11	4	4	0	1	0	6	1	0	0	0	0	0

The order was supposed to arrive on Monday the 1st August and I recieved a text that it would arrive between 7 and 11am. The courier did not arrive and I had to leave to go to work. No card was left!  No word or details to contact the carrier I was unable to let them know I would be at work. When I arrived home on the second  a card had been left with a number.  I called the number and left a voicemail as there was no answer. I recieved a text the next morning on the third. The person did not respond again.  I rang again and left another voicemail around 10am  again offering 2 different numbers to reach me on to rearrange delivery  no answer or response. I called yet again 45 minutes later  no answer. This time I was advising that there would be someone home to receive the delivery. My husband was actually home ALL day as he had changed work plans. There was NO delivery attempt yet again and no phone all to discuss.  I checked your site to see the status of the order as I was off again today and available to receive the order. It says that delivery was attempted at 13.45 on Wednesday (forget that the text said delivery would be between 7 and 11). Irrespective  someone was at home the entire day on Wednesday.   I have 2 young children who hear a pin drop. We are awake from 5.30 each morning until around 11pm. We did not miss the delivery  your carrier did not even attempt to deliver the parcel.  I m not sure whether these carriers are using their own vehicles  or whether they are using company vehicles. I myself am the logistics manager for my company and know this can be checked by looking at any installed tracker on the vehicle.  Given this situation I strongly suspect that this isn t the first time this particular individual has lied about attempting to make a delivery. 3 alleged attempts.... 1 card recieved.... 3 phone calls .... 0 returned phone calls.  I m extremely disappointed by this service and would hope that Tesco Direct would also be disappointed by the appalling service provided by your contracter.  I expect this to be investigated and I would also like an explanation on why I was not contacted and why they provided false information of delivery on Wednesday (in particular) but also Monday delivery ... Based on the lack of a delivery card on both of these days.  To add  I have never had any issues with delivery or communication with your biggest direct delivery competitor  Asda  and many others as I spend around £300 on online shopping per month.   I look forward to your response. In the meantime I will post this on social media as that may provide a quicker response.

When I go to resolve it I m sat waiting half an hour for them to check cameras can I add with 4 children aged 6 weeks 2 7 & 9 so wasn t a pleasant wait!! They Come back tell me they can t check the cameras and can t get threw to the cash place to check the till. But admits I have 2 £20 notes BUT can t give me my £10 this point I m getting frustrated because my 2 year old is board and running wild. They tried taking my number for me to go back for my money another day but I don t live near that tesco.  Long story short I got my £10 back and a complimentary kids meal LOL are they for real my kids had just eaten. My point of this post is you should have other things in place for when your staff underpay people and think certain staff members need training on how to use a till and how to speak to customers....					2016-08-04T19:26:59+0000	1470338819	2016-08-04 21:26:59	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	10	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just tried to purchase one single item using a giftcard given as part of a promotion when buying pet insurance  only to find out that I have to spend £40.00 otherwise I will be charged  £4.00 extra at the checkout. Plus you are charging 0.40p for carrier bags which by law you should only charge 5p. I have a good mind to send your so called gift card back and even cancel my pet insurance. The item is even priced cheaper on Amazon with free delivery! You are making the item £10.00 more expensive.					2016-08-04T18:19:29+0000	1470334769	2016-08-04 20:19:29	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She was on till 19 and her name was Shirley! Usually with the kids with me  it s a bit of nightmare trying to pack and keep them in sight  and it s all a bit of a rushed operation! She took time out  ( whilst still scanning) to talk to my girls  asking them lots of questions about the food I was buying  whether they liked it or not  and keeping them so entertained whilst I was packing away. She was so lovely and polite  and an absolute credit to your store. You usually get a lot of bad customer service reviews wherever you go  so I thought it was about time to put some positivity around! She really made me smile when leaving the store  and you don t often get that! So thank you to Shirley  for going above and beyond your normal checkout duties! Please let this lovely woman be recognised!! 😇😇😇😇😇😇					2016-08-04T17:34:41+0000	1470332081	2016-08-04 19:34:41	3	4	3	0	7	4	3	1	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought they were lovely for the price and sizes were great.   I felt I had to write in because the order says it takes 28 days. I ordered them last weekend and they arrived today!.  Not only that the quality of them for the price is brilliant they are just as good if not better than our local school uniform shops but half the price.   The fact that some of the money goes back to the school is just fantastic. I m very very pleased with my purchase and will recommend them to all the mums at school. Thank you. 👍😄👍😄					2016-08-04T17:17:42+0000	1470331062	2016-08-04 19:17:42	5	3	5	0	8	3	2	1	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our online delivery arrived this afternoon  unfortunately the milk we had ordered for our 2 year old had a use by date of 29 July.  Obviously we sent it back with the driver. Within 30 minutes we received a phone call from the store  apologising for the incident and promising that a replacement bottle would be delivered within the hour. As promised a delivery driver turned up and not only had a bottle of milk but also a beautiful bunch of roses and some bath toys for our little boy.  Excellent customer service  I wish more companies would follow your lead.  Thank you!					2016-08-04T15:19:52+0000	1470323992	2016-08-04 17:19:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On the Monday I called your customer service line and was told sorry there is not a lot they can do as its down to the shop to investigate.   She had to leave all her shopping behind and wait 5 days for a new card  My daughter is a young mother of 2 and is carry TWINS.  I feel that the customer service in that store is of a very low standard and I m sure you be as upset as I am about how poorly they dealt with the situation .					2016-08-04T13:11:52+0000	1470316312	2016-08-04 15:11:52	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter was taken on as a personal shopper for a 3 month temporary contract. At the end of 3 months some were kept some were not. She has since reapplied 10 times for personal shopper jobs at the same store and is rejected every time. She had been fully trained had full uniform and can walk in tomorrow and start. But no   rejected every time. She had a top rag rate and worked exceptionally hard.  How do they think this makes a 17yr old girl feel. Especially when she sees other people being trained to do a job she is experienced in and without being given the opportunity to do it again. It s shameful tesco.					2016-08-04T12:53:14+0000	1470315194	2016-08-04 14:53:14	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On 2nd August got an email from oak city saying my order has been processed then not long after an email from you saying your order has been despatched and expect delivery on Wednesday 3rd August. Come Wednesday 3rd August I dismantle the old bed and have our room ready for it to arrive and by mid afternoon I m checking delivery and all it said was print so I phoned oak city to try and see where my bed is and they said they have this problem with tesco as they can t meet your criteria as express delivery so don t expect delivery today. After I got off the phone from oak city I tried XPL and they was not helpful at all and told me it could be tomorrow or Friday they can t say and told me to keep looking at the delivery status. I ve looked at this today and only shows 2 pieces that has arrived at the delivery depot not 3 so again where does that leave me on delivery. I took Wednesday 3rd August off work as I was expecting delivery but now I m having to take further time off work and wait in for my bed to be delivered which may or may not arrive today or tomorrow. Thankfully my work was ok about this as the had cover but where does that leave me having to take holiday for something which may not arrive. I ve sent an email to tesco direct which I m still waiting a reply!!! Sleeping on the floor is not ideal!!!!! 1 very unhappy customer					2016-08-04T11:44:28+0000	1470311068	2016-08-04 13:44:28	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This morning an older lady came up to me to say how wonderful it was to turn down every aisle and see all the children enjoying fruit. When I looked around  all of them were munching on apples and banana s. Soooo much better than the usual (& I m guilty also) bags of crisps & sweets. Plus (hopefully) stops wastage & disposal of fruit. Great idea.

Last night at around 7:50pm one of the delivery vehicles BD65 XEF was driving extremely recklessly. He appeared to be racing another driver  speeding and cutting many drivers up  including me TWICE! Thankfully so many other vehicles were beeping at the van so I was aware of the danger. At a roundabout he took the wrong lane to try and race round me and cut back in front of me. If I hadn t slammed my brakes on he would have hit me. What made it worse was that I had my young nephew in the car with me. I was extremely livid and it makes me think twice about shopping with Tesco anymore if this is the kind of staff being employed and how little care they take.  I only hope the van was empty otherwise there will be unhappy shoppers with damaged and bruised foods!					2016-08-04T09:25:07+0000	1470302707	2016-08-04 11:25:07	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My order was £15 and voucher amount was £7 so outstanding balance was £8 to pay. After checking my bank £8 was pending three times. I called your customer service and spoke to a Daniel Lewis and all I can say is his attitude and mannerism were appalling. I have never spoke to a customer service advisor as abrupt  dismissive  rude & unhelpful! I asked to speak to his manager and he told me was the manager and I told him I didn t wish to deal with him and asked to speak to another member of staff who was more than helpful!					2016-08-04T08:25:22+0000	1470299122	2016-08-04 10:25:22	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Come September 1st Christmas will be thrown in our faces for 4 months as usual. This literally makes the year feel so short and time is going by so quickly because corporations are so quick to jump on the next occassion. January 1st is now Easter. Tesco please stop this.					2016-08-03T22:33:51+0000	1470263631	2016-08-04 00:33:51	8	18	8	2	28	17	8	9	22	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had half a trolley of items and had scanned them all in amounting to just over £100. I got to the end and was  randomly  selected to be checked. I was the only person using the self scanner. Your assistant came over said she had to do a check and then proceeded to scan some items. She then walked off to her cupboard and scanned something on the door  she came back  scanned some more items  walked off did the same thing with the cupboard door. She came back asked me if I d scanned the same item twice and what bar code I d scanned on the in store bakery French stick  not explaining what or why and then continued to scan the rest of my shopping. I told her that she can scan all the shopping and when she had finished could confirm I hadn t taken anything without scanning it. I know it s not your assistants fault but why did I bother scanning it if you don t trust me anyway?					2016-08-03T22:19:12+0000	1470262752	2016-08-04 00:19:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve shopped at Perivale for 24 years so a bit disappointed at the treatment by overzealous managers demonstrating an amazing willingness to exercise stubbornness over common sense...  Shockingly bad customer service at Perivale. Apparently in his (Alan the manager - although he wasn t sure) judgement Gina is buying the wine for her younger sister (no proof or any other indication of this). I was a bit stumped  I ve shopped in Tesco s for 24 years  bought alcohol with my kids in tow without a problem. I asked for the policy on this. Alan s turn to be stumped. Another manager pointed to the sign on the till  but I pointed out that it references proof of age NOT anything else certainly not any policy about the expertise your staff has in profiling customers to determine how people will behave (proof of age was provided in case you were wondering). I challenged this and asked for the policy and guidance on this. There must be some sort of guidance otherwise how can you determine any judgement is valid. This was refused. In fact rather than properly justify really poor customer service  I  was told to complain to head office and then they proceeded to walk away. The attitude of your management frankly stinks. I d suggest doing a mystery shopper exercise on them  as you surely don t wish this behaviour to be representative of your company. Anyhow of course we left empty handed  and hugely dissatisfied. I hope you will  look into this and provide an explanation to me. As for your managers I d suggest some refresher customer service training.					2016-08-03T22:18:00+0000	1470262680	2016-08-04 00:18:00	4	8	5	1	14	8	4	4	6	0	4	0	0	0	0	1	0

I used to use your own brand nappies a while ago but switched to mamia as aldi was nearer to me. Anyway they used to be great. They were amazing and very absorbent. The other day I went to tesco as I was nearby and in desperate need of a nappy for my son so I got a pack on the one off. I love the new design of your nappys. But there s one problem they aren t exactly absorbent anymore and don t hold much. Each time I ve changed my sons nappy. The nappy keeps splitting and He s had crystals etc all over his private area and bum. I m very disappointed as I now can t use the rest of the pack incase they irritate my son as he has very sensitive skin. Big thumbs down tesco. Think you need to take a look at the nappies as I m not the only one who has had the same problem					2016-08-03T20:59:52+0000	1470257992	2016-08-03 22:59:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Especially to the lovely man who pushed my trolley to the car as I was trying to push a wheelchair and a trolley at the same time. I didn t get a chance to catch his name  but we need more people like that in the world 👐👌👍. Thank you!!!					2016-08-03T20:56:34+0000	1470257794	2016-08-03 22:56:34	12	2	12	0	14	2	1	1	2	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

My husband was shopping with our two young children and our 4 year old autistic son saw an ice cream picture that really frightened him. He was crying and very distressed and not only did a member of staff help get the rest of the shopping for him but they also opened up a new till and gave both the children a chocolate. This really helped to calm our son and my husband was so thankful for the assistance.					2016-08-03T20:02:50+0000	1470254570	2016-08-03 22:02:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For the 2 customer service ladies and the trolley man who came to my rescue today  as I accidentally locked my little girl Sophie in the car. They were so helpful and kind and able to get the problem sorted. Also the Policeman who was there at the right time!!

You ve gave me the points back  but won t tell me which email address the vouchers were sent to. Apparently when enabling fraud  every little helps .  Giving that the email address is on my account I believe I have a right to view said email address. Given that the DPA gives exceptions that allows it. Or is giving out personal details only something you do to for fraudsters and not against them?  I ll just follow up with some parts of the DPA:  Part II - Section 7 -  (4) Where a data controller cannot comply with the request without disclosing information relating to another individual who can be identified from that information  he is not obliged to comply with the request unless—  (b)it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with the request without the consent of the other individual. (I would say commiting fraud would make it reasonable)  (6)In determining for the purposes of subsection (4)(b) whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with the request without the consent of the other individual concerned  regard shall be had  in particular  to—  (a)any duty of confidentiality owed to the other individual  (there is no duty on your part to the fraudster)					2016-08-03T14:40:15+0000	1470235215	2016-08-03 16:40:15	0	6	0	0	6	6	5	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Maybe some little food bins at the end of aisles so when the kids are finished eating they can throw their rubbish away 👍🏻 or at least point people in the direction of the bins when they are getting the fruit 👍🏻	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13934703_10154442535494292_6717288802154082767_n.jpg?oh=a3efb24b10e9dcb9d8c6aca07694b059&oe=58EF2390	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13934703_10154442535494292_6717288802154082767_n.jpg?oh=0d0026b6094e6bf2055cbafd6b739217&oe=58EEADE4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154442535494292&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-03T14:38:10+0000	1470235090	2016-08-03 16:38:10	35	18	37	0	55	16	5	11	10	0	35	2	0	0	0	0	0

Not my usual shop. Decided to eat in the cafe with my 3 grandchildren What an awful experience they wanted kids lunch bags   No bags no choice. I decided not to eat as not much choice & just have a coffee. It ll have to be in a takeaway cup cos we ve got no clean cups I was told at the tills !!  Well looking at the state of a good 30% of the tables it was clear to see why there was no clean cups   There was a lot of food on the floor too & limited clean cutlery.

Fancied a change from my usual chicken and sweetcorn......... Bad move Ash  bad move. First bite into what looked like a lovely Smoked ham and cheese sandwich showed me that it also contained mayonnaise  not a big fan of it but I ll still eat it. So that makes this sandwich a Smoked Ham  Cheddar AND MAYONNAISE. Benefit of the doubt  I ll go in for a second bite to be greated by what felt like a bone. Seriously  this ham is that poor quality it s almost solid. Am i ever so glad I got it at the reduced price. Come on Tesco  sort it out. First of all its not hard to put on the front of the packaging that it also includes mayonnaise now is it and second of all  I don t even know what you can do with the quality of the ham. Pretty disappointed and still hungry.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13626558_10154238807540605_1109378736945871209_n.jpg?oh=c37f1f60c3d2f1648071f5bd7300bf63&oe=58EFD016	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13626558_10154238807540605_1109378736945871209_n.jpg?oh=87240896665634a1cb620b8c99de0cf4&oe=58E3281B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154238807540605&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-03T12:32:43+0000	1470227563	2016-08-03 14:32:43	3	21	3	0	24	19	6	13	12	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would just like to remind you of an incident that happened with one of your Durrington delivery drivers.  On arrival at my place of work he was asked whether my car should be moved as there was only a small gap for him to pass through with his trolley.  He said it wasn t necessary.  At this time my front number plate was still attached to my car.  After delivering two trollies of food  it was in his hand.  He told a colleague he may have caught it with his trolley.  When I spoke to him about it he turned into a comedian  i quote  shall I phone Tesco and get them to send you some double sided sticky tape   and with that he left.  I telephoned customer services who said they would investigate and call back.  They did not.  I telephoned again and was informed I would be contacted in 24 hours.  Whilst on this second phone call  the customer services agent contacted Durrington and they spoke to the driver.  I was then informed that the driver denied knocking off my number plate.  And that was that.  the driver s word over mine and my colleagues.  No further contact at all.  the business I work for spend thousands of pounds a year shopping on line and you think it is acceptable to ignore the damage that one of your drivers has caused to my car.  When I am next in work  I shall inform my boss of your  less than customer focused  customer service.					2016-08-03T11:33:33+0000	1470224013	2016-08-03 13:33:33	5	8	5	0	13	8	4	4	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought 2 products and left the store to continue my shopping in sainsburys at crystal palace  so bad was this shopping experience. I asked a shop assistant why is the store in such a state his reply  I don t work here I m just standing in for someone .

This is regarding self service checkouts and basically labelling all self service shoppers as thieves. You are more than adware that these machines have many faults. I feel offended by dailymails write ups as not everyone is thieves. This was my comment on the post and il like to kbow what you tecos have to say about this  Not all are thieves. The area of that university is quit a hard up area.  Iv been using them from start ..if machine plays up there is always a member of staff at a stand in the section.  Its surveyed under camera so doubt that tescos has such issues on a constant basis. Personally I do think its down to areas places and and how organizations of staff. There is thieves in every town . if it was as bad as that everywhere the shops wouldnt keep them as long as they have as stores be at a loss and i know in particular tescos hate losses. Also the machines in tescos go standby if it mis scans or it speak out if it thinks its picked up on an un scaned item . sometimes they dont scan so call staff as it goes in a no motion working mode.The machines are far from perfect and have many faults constantly so these statstics are not legitimate as many readings are due too faults via the machines they freeze alot and also things that do scan which can be proved by reciepts that machines quit often state something in bag unscanned.  Its a big fault with them that has never been corrected.  Machines all need updating with a better design with less faults.

II use this card to purchase online from Sainsburys  Asda and various other online shops with absolutely no problem at all.  I have more than enough money to cover the goods and it s good enough to use in your stores!  This is 2016 and I m absolutely amazed.  It s put me off giving you my custom for good now.  There were goods that I needed from yourselves that our local Sainburys do not sell and I cannot get to our nearest Tesco store today.  This is really poor and I suggest this is something you look into getting sorted because it amazes me that every other store can accept it but yourselves!					2016-08-03T07:13:27+0000	1470208407	2016-08-03 09:13:27	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I struggle to do a big shop in the holidays with my boys as being on the spectrum they can sometimes get sensory overload and have a meltdown so i ordered an online tesco shop  the first delivery driver said that the road diversion was too far from his journey and didn t have time so didn t deliver  the second driver realised it was a shop for kids and pushed the trolley ( that was taller than him) a couple of streets past the the road closure! He even did a second trip for one item that he could have taken back! Sorry for the long post but bless him!!!His name was shaun  so thank you  you ve made our day x					2016-08-02T20:29:19+0000	1470169759	2016-08-02 22:29:19	12	1	12	0	13	1	1	0	1	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was helped out by a lovely lady called Janet. I was starting to think I was not destined to get a new TV at first as the machine did not generate an order but was showing as pending on my card. As I was happy for it to be processed again Janet put it all through the tills and advised what I d need to do if 2 TVS showed up for to get my refund sorted. I did tell her how thankful I was whole in store but would appreciate if it could be passed on how much I valued her help and patience					2016-08-02T20:12:52+0000	1470168772	2016-08-02 22:12:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter and myself went in last week to have a look at new phones. Andrew talked us through the different phones and gave us all the info we needed. We went back today to purchase the phones and he remembered what we had looked at. He was patient whilst my daughter made her mind up and then helped me decide on my phone. A super helpful person who should be recognised for his fantastic customer service. I will definitely be recommending people go to Tesco mobile.  Please can you make sure Andrew gets recognised for his great customer service. Thank you					2016-08-02T19:30:09+0000	1470166209	2016-08-02 21:30:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having loose/unwrapped/ food is obviously encouraging insects to eat them. Many will say that by buying wrapped instead of loose food is being unfriendly to the environment. Wrong. I prefer buying packaged food and recycle the packaging afterwards. You can rinse some fruit and veg but not none of the bakery items. s					2016-08-02T18:36:54+0000	1470163014	2016-08-02 20:36:54	0	5	0	0	5	4	2	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

With it there was a card  on the front was a some fruit & veg in a heart & the wording   A little thank you means a lot . Below is the inside of the card.  So  it was news to me that this was my 500th shop - wow so that s about 10 years & well over £20 000 (based on min £40 per shop) of loyalty.  And all I get is a lousy card!!  Here s a tip Tesco s if going to bother to acknowledge a customer s loyalty make them feel valued - a bottle of bubbly  more Club card points  a voucher  etc.  Rather than how I now feel which is unvalued  unappreciated & disappointed.  If there s only enough budget for a card I suggest you ditch the idea as I suspect very few of your customers will be counting their shops!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13912702_10157191435155414_6353473032583404363_n.jpg?oh=6b23e69b4efc56e933d3bc4bad0b72eb&oe=5918FCB6	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13912702_10157191435155414_6353473032583404363_n.jpg?oh=d5ba2b16af33335ce8981dbd66667167&oe=58DE51BB	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157191435155414&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-02T17:57:00+0000	1470160620	2016-08-02 19:57:00	3	9	5	0	14	9	8	1	31	0	3	0	1	0	1	0	0

Personally I would not have touched the Woodside Farms brand with a 10 foot barge-pole but the ones he picked up are rank - half are discoloured and off smelling  never mind the poor butchery and trimming.  Have had to throw away 3 out of 6 chops.  Not prepared to make the 16 mile round trip to return them so Tesco would not know of this customer s dissatisfaction if it were not for this website. #willneverbuywoodsidefarmsagain #musttryaldi					2016-08-02T17:35:29+0000	1470159329	2016-08-02 19:35:29	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I didn t catch his name  however  he was an older gentleman who was working at about 1 700 hrs . He was incredibly patient with my 10 month old son who refused to hand over his packet of mini cheddars to be scanned and insisted on carrying my items to the car for me  completely unaware of the fact that I have a disability which makes holding even a cup of tea a challenge. Due to the combined effort of my torture of a child who refuses to ever sleep and the many special breeds of idiot I d encountered driving on the road I was actually so flustered that I forgot to even put petrol in my car and left with a soggy packet of mini cheddars and some snacks to keep me going through what is probably going to be yet another sleepless night. However  despite not having remembered to get the petrol I needed this was a very enjoyable experience and I hope my thanks can be passed on to this fantastic gentleman who went out of his way to make my day that little bit easier.  Kind regards  A very grateful tired mummy					2016-08-02T17:03:33+0000	1470157413	2016-08-02 19:03:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is completely shocking! You re a massive company and can t repeat an order yourselves from any system.

They have the sense to put lots of trolleys with various seat options by the parent and child spaces. It makes life a LOT easier. Is this potentially something that could be introduced in all stores? Please ask the Stockport branch!! Also  the free fruit went down a treat and we had the easiest shopping trip we d had for months!

I ordered a TV from them yesterday to be delivered today. The tracker in the website doesn t give you a time only saying that s it s dispatched and is frankly useless. I rang up and asked if they had a rough guide and they said between 1230 and 1430. I was pleased with this and waited until 1530 at home until I rang again to get an update. They then told me that they couldn t find the property when they tried to deliver it at 1330 earlier in the day. I asked if there was a system in place to tell me instead of wasting my time they said no and that it would be delivered tomorrow. I have to be in to sign for it so now that has resulted in 2 days off work  many hours of wasted time and only finding out because I rang up. I find this completely unacceptable and have lost confidence in Tesco all together.  Many other companies have got this right I find it hard how they can t.					2016-08-02T14:59:53+0000	1470149993	2016-08-02 16:59:53	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Just a brief query; I m now able to access my Clubcard Vouchers and Coupons  which have just been calculated  and I can see online that I ve been given one coupon. I m usually given quite a lot more than one  so I m just curious as to whether or not this is the new norm?   It s not really a major concern or anything. I m just curious.   Thanks for your time.					2016-08-02T13:05:32+0000	1470143132	2016-08-02 15:05:32	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In April 2012 we welcomed triplets to our family  we already had a 5yr & 3yr old! Every time I have been shopping in tesco ilminster the staff have all been very friendly  helpful & kind towards us as a family. In the early days they would offer a member of staff to push a trolley whilst I pushed the triplets in their pram to do my shopping. Today I had to go in with all 5 children  being the school holidays much more food is being eaten! I had two trolleys and the staff helped me pack my shopping  load it on to the check out & just generally very kind & friendly! I just want to say thank you to the team at tesco ilminster & hope that you can pass this on to them as they have made life easier when it comes to shopping and allowing me to keep life as normal as possible  big thanks to the team!!!					2016-08-02T11:03:41+0000	1470135821	2016-08-02 13:03:41	112	9	117	4	130	9	8	1	25	0	112	5	0	0	0	0	0

One member of staff was quite helpful trying to assist me in finding them before saying it looked like they ve stopped them and to check with customer services.  I said it would be a shame and if they had as would probably have to go elsewhere to get them she said  a lot of people said that .....she was then laughing and joking about it a minute or two later when I was in the next isle so it appears your staff really don t care about potentially losing customers.  This also seemed to be the attitude of the lady on customer services when I tried to check if the products had been discontinued etc...   😡					2016-08-02T09:40:52+0000	1470130852	2016-08-02 11:40:52	0	9	0	0	9	9	3	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to say how lovely the man was. He firstly apologised for being 5 mins early bless him. I started taking my shopping and my little girl asked what was wrong with he s leg?! I said go and ask him he won t bite. She did!   He was so nice and friendly and explained to the children what had happened to him and showed them he s  new  leg. They were so at ease and he was happy to answer there questions in a way they understand. It s not often we have a talkative delivery man.

I m a stickler for checking dates usually but as it was for dinner the day after I didn t need a long date so didn t check. I never expected it to be out of date before I even bought it. I had to then take it back and exchange it but as there was no large joints left I swapped for 2 smaller...well I ve never had such awful meat. They were so fatty there was hardly any meat! Not good when u have guests for tea....I m not a happy customer!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13934878_10208713304782843_5498939075726532919_n.jpg?oh=46237577f19d2e3e5a68dc0da83fd455&oe=591E5503	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13934878_10208713304782843_5498939075726532919_n.jpg?oh=3fb3458e7cde143b0902663fcbb47fac&oe=58D7D50E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208713304782843&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-02T09:02:33+0000	1470128553	2016-08-02 11:02:33	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The colour is totally different from the school colour and they are so thin. Also this year i ordered 6-7 years and last year they had 5-6 but there exactly the same size :-/ and don t fit my children. What can be done about this as I m really not happy with the quality.

I was at Ryde Tesco Extra on the Isle of Wight earlier and was browsing the new extended Free From aisle. A staff member made a point of approaching me and asking what I thought of the new range.   I nodded my approval but did mention that I thought there were too many ready made products and not enough staple ingredients for those who want to make our own without the sugar laden extras - e.g you stock several brands and ranges of gluten free bread and rolls but only 3 different bags of GF flour (Doves plain  SR and bread flour).   I went on to say that I often go to Morrisons purely because they stock Doves Farm rice flours and gram flour. This staff member listened carefully to everything I said  made notes and when I explained that Gram flour is actually chickpea flour she seemed really pleased  saying that several customers had asked for chickpea flour but it was hard to find with suppliers and that this new information could really help.  I have to say that it was a very refreshing touch to have staff discussing with customers what they think - please do encourage more staff to do this sort of thing. As a coeliac  shopping can be mired in frustration (e.g you sell a gluten free fresh baked bread stick....but store it in amongst the other regular fresh baked goods so a true coeliac could still not eat it because of cross contamination) so this conversation did leave me continuing this shopping with a smile on my face...well done to that employee!					2016-08-01T21:27:50+0000	1470086870	2016-08-01 23:27:50	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

BEWARE one and all if you get petrol from TESCO MIDDLETON. I went today and the pump carried on as though I was still filling up  AFTER I had released the nozzle lever. I couldn t believe my eyes as I watched the numbers still changing! It was only a matter of pence  but still  it s the principle of the thing. Although I used  pay at the pump  I brought what had happened to the attention of the assistant and worst of all and the most annoying things was  she didn t believe me!!! It is at this point  I have to bite my tongue and stop typing.					2016-08-01T19:49:01+0000	1470080941	2016-08-01 21:49:01	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got home and popped them in the microwave to warm them up. After 2 mins the outside was lovely and warm but the insides were still freezing cold. Now  my microwave works fine  so I checked the thighs i had put back in the fridge for tomorrow. Turns out they were frozen inside. Considering they are advertised as able to be frozen  this is not good. You are not supposed to freeze items that have already been defrosted. Also  what would ve happened if I d decided not to warm them up and tried to eat them cold? I think the tescos slogan  every little helps  needs to be changed to  every little helps give you food poisoning . Interested in your views on this. 🍗🚑					2016-08-01T19:36:27+0000	1470080187	2016-08-01 21:36:27	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The cashier  a larger balding man  carried on his conversation with the customers he had just served  I must of been stood there for a good 5 minutes  being totally ignored  and it was only when I removed ALL my items OFF the conveyor to go to another till that he turned his head  looked at me  never said anything to me  then turned back and carried on his conversation with the previous customers.... To say I m disgusted is an understatement  I hope you can find out who this man is and teach him some people skills					2016-08-01T19:28:11+0000	1470079691	2016-08-01 21:28:11	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My nan shops in the Tesco Cheam park farm branch every week and she goes to a specific cashier every week. The reason she goes to this paticular lady is because she gives fantastic service. She packs every one of my nans bags and lifts them into the trolley for her because through conversation she has learnt that my nan has a very week shoulder. If my nan has forgotten something she will go get it for her  she literally cannot do enough. My nan just rang me to tell me that a delivery driver turned up on her door today with the most beautiful bunch of flowers and it was from the cashier Catherine Caffrey. She sent them as she knows again through talking to my nan that she is having a tough time with my grandad who has parkinsons and slight dementia and she wanted to send them to cheer her up. I actually work for Tesco at another store as a manager and used to know Catherine years ago when I worked with her as a team leader but regardless of this I feel what she has done is truly touching and amazing. My nan has done the customer view point before to commend Catherine on service but I don t believe she got the recognition she deserved. Well done Catherine caffrey my nan thinks your a star x					2016-08-01T19:15:58+0000	1470078958	2016-08-01 21:15:58	283	24	304	21	349	24	18	6	10	0	279	20	0	0	0	0	0

However I went to a self-serve machine and the coin slipped out of my hand as I was about to pay. The woman who helped me  lifted the scanner  and noticed (as did I) that it had fell into where all coins (once inserted) are stored.  However I was told there was nothing they could do. I am absolutely disgusted that your machines have this gap  basically you are gaining free money! When Morrisons machine accidently took an extra five pound note of mine  they happily opened the money compartment to hand it back to me. Granted it s only a £1  but when I have two children  under three to feed  that £1 goes a long way! I am disgusted that I have now had to come home and ask my partner for another pound so we are actually able to get some milk!					2016-08-01T18:29:18+0000	1470076158	2016-08-01 20:29:18	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of the items I picked up happened to be a tub of your own brand potato salad. It went down a treat with everyone at the BBQ. However you can imagine my horror today when I took the potato salad back out of the fridge to eat with leftovers  only to realise the use by date was in fact 30th July......the day BEFORE I purchased it from your store. So thanks to someone not doing their job properly (perhaps feeling a little peaky after a heavy Saturday night)  I inadvertently fed all of my BBQ guests out of date potato salad. Luckily we ve all survived to tell the tale  and no one appears to have been taken ill  but nevertheless I m not impressed!!					2016-08-01T17:25:48+0000	1470072348	2016-08-01 19:25:48	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wear a bike helmet with a flip up lid  meaning my face is fully visible. Most stores are happy with this  but the East Molesey store seem to have a real issue. I have to take the whole thing off.  It s policy  they say   so we can see your face . Which you can  cos it s a flip up lid. Meanwhile  behind me  is a guy in full Elvis get up  shades  wig etc  who you would not be able to tell from your own grandmother. Problem? Of course not  because he s not a motorcyclist  who are clearly sent from hell and shoplift at every given opportunity. Elvis  on the other hand  who despite having been dead for many years  clearly cannot be a security threat because  well hey  everyone knows Elvis...					2016-08-01T17:21:16+0000	1470072076	2016-08-01 19:21:16	2	7	2	0	9	7	1	6	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had just come around the corner from the Cross Douglas Road and he was in front of me. He indicated left  and pulled in to the side of the road behind a parked van  so I continued driving to overtake. Just as I was coming up alongside him  he accelerated and swung the van around across the front of my car. I had to slam on the brakes and the wet ground meant I slid up the road and only barely missed him as he burned up into the estate.					2016-08-01T16:27:10+0000	1470068830	2016-08-01 18:27:10	1	7	1	0	8	7	2	5	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a beautiful kitchen fitted a few years ago through you and all was great until one of the fronts on the cupboards began to come away. I contacted Tesco Kitchens who sent me a generic letter telling me that Mark 2  the supplier to Tesco  had gone into administration and I would have to wait to see what they decided to do. It has been months now and another cupboard is showing the same signs as the first (which has now split) and I don t know what to do.... I fully understand that the company you used went into administration but I bought the kitchen through you and it is still well within warranty. Many thanks in hope.

Their cookery class for children whilst you shop is the best idea ever! I left two of my children with super friendly and wonderful staff  I was able to complete a Big shop in peace and concentrate on what we actually needed  and the kids had so much fun making pizzas and fruit yoghurts and got a special tour of the shop! Win win win all around  I hope you continue this wonderful scheme . I have been a customer in Shoreham for many years and I would not think of shopping anywhere else....Thanks Tescos:))					2016-08-01T16:11:01+0000	1470067861	2016-08-01 18:11:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will never buy another because it is a rip off  RIP OFF . The lamb shanl was just a lump of bone with some gristle and temdons. The tiniest piece of meat was attached which would not saitidfy a kitten. Tesco should be ashamed of this product. They at one time sold Lamb shanks in their finest range which were superb. No wonder they are losiung business.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13900164_638275079672691_4782392902607363413_n.jpg?oh=cfc11c58fc1037d12244c9b67f4b0e14&oe=58EBD317	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13900164_638275079672691_4782392902607363413_n.jpg?oh=6624b69a40c36be974b3af8789f33097&oe=58E47E8A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=638275079672691&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-01T14:36:16+0000	1470062176	2016-08-01 16:36:16	0	3	0	1	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I laughed and thought nothing more about it until my tesco delivery arrived at 10:30.  The lovely driver noticed the sign on his way in and when leaving he went over and put a pound in for my little girl! How kind of him- no idea of his name but assume he is from tesco newtownbreda.

Well little things make a big difference and in a country that has a lot of competition and to be frank better customer service I can. Today spent £90 in the Birmingham Road store Dudley. I made a simple request  could you put my fresh chicken in a small bag please? After consulting with a supervisor I was told no! By all accounts they are not allowed. The fact I was placing it next to household goods and other non food items did not matter. The fact that the scents from other purchases may affect my fresh produce again did not matter. So for a bag that costs probably £1 for a thousand (if that) you Tesco have lost my custom...purely out of principle. Morrisons  Asda  Sainsbury and dare I say it Aldi have never declined my request so that s where my next £90 is going!					2016-08-01T13:18:29+0000	1470057509	2016-08-01 15:18:29	0	12	0	0	12	12	6	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is disgusting customer service money doesn t grow in trees for me either in disabled with two children. Please contact me to arrange refunding the overpayment that was made due to call handlers telling me I needed to pay more so I did so. I played by card and it wasn t applied to my policy but instead held on account. My biggest worries also how many other Tesco have done the same thing to. Perhaps I should publicly ask so as to gain support and hopefully so Tesco nay listen sort and refund me. I also gave solicitors fees I can claim via financial ombudsman if required.					2016-08-01T12:42:10+0000	1470055330	2016-08-01 14:42:10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your store manager came out to look at the damage and was totally horrified at the state it left my car in (and to add insult to injury was still dirty) I have chased up a response from yourselves for well over the 2 week allowance you give yourselves. Was assured by one member of your customer service team that this would be resolved to my satisfaction. Well I finally got my response. You admit that your car wash did the damage but refuse to sort this due to an apparent tiny little sign you have saying you don t accept liability. You are the biggest bunch of con artists going. I would think a supposed respectable company such as yourselves would not be sneaky to put tiny print somewhere in a game of hide and seek (I still have not found this sign) to cover your backsides. If it s not fit for purpose you shouldn t be taking £6 off of people for the pleasure of having their car totally wrecked. I wish I could show everyone the rest of the damage you have done to my car but it won t let me upload anymore. I will be taking this further. Disgusting Tesco. Shame on you.  I will NEVER shop with you again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13891927_10153992206918152_7794378051482210584_n.jpg?oh=8d62daa435923895b6aed81bd0dadccd&oe=58D863F4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13891927_10153992206918152_7794378051482210584_n.jpg?oh=1c47dc9a95769f75d089242962bd21ef&oe=591907F9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153992206918152&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-01T12:35:55+0000	1470054955	2016-08-01 14:35:55	0	17	2	2	21	17	1	16	6	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

Is this the level of mental arithmetic of the youth of today...? Just been to the checkout where my bill came to £5.02. Handed my £20 note over and immediately dug into my pocket for coppers and gave the cashier a 2p.  She looked at me with confusion in her eyes  almost horror. Evidently  she had already entered £20 tendered and the till had calculated the change for her. She declined the 2p.  It ll save my pockets and you ll have more change   I said. She took the 2p  placed to the side of the cash drawer and continued counting out £14.98 in change. She handed it to me with my receipt and gave the usual thank you and goodbye (as trained).  You should probably give me my 2p back.  Is this a failure of our education system or Tesco selection/training?					2016-08-01T11:57:52+0000	1470052672	2016-08-01 13:57:52	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Roughly 3 weeks on and still nothing back so I thought I d post up just to at least warn people to be careful of the dates as clearly some products haven t been checked properly.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13895330_1178361535535793_8244989442460186293_n.jpg?oh=3d5a33a707bf95708f4981362f9e95aa&oe=59191409	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13895330_1178361535535793_8244989442460186293_n.jpg?oh=d003a1b6afd39127e870aaec0a4a5bd5&oe=58EB131C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1178361535535793&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-08-01T08:39:40+0000	1470040780	2016-08-01 10:39:40	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

So this morning before work i nipped in to Tesco South Wigston Leicestershire to pick some up  there were lots on the shelves. Walked to the checkout happy with my nerfs  maple pecan plait and milk for work safe in the knowledge i was going to ambush my 6 year old at the front door tonight and generally annoy mummy for several hours.  At checkout the offer didnt come up  so i asked the assistant.   Im sorry they have to be ordered in its different  was the reply.  Come in! But i have and i can see your fine array of goods on the shelves ready for me to purcahse! its payday morning and i have an ambush planned for tonight!   Tesco could you explain in what way different? I have to now go online to order stock in thats already in South Wigston  wait for it to come in. ( Which is already there ) Go back in to the same shop to pick up stock thats now in ( which technically was on the shelf yesterday by the time i get back in )  This just annoys customers  wastes your staff time explaining this and wastes my time doing a return journey.  Paul ( Not nerfing my daughter tonight ) Howland 39y8m  ps. Dont worry the ambush is still planned just delayed to when the STOCK COMES IN!  pps. The pecan plait was nice though but now i have crumbs in my keyboard.					2016-08-01T07:27:26+0000	1470036446	2016-08-01 09:27:26	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Brought kids a phone each  1 December and 1 January.  Got tesco sim cards from tesco north brackell.  Both times I explained we were moving to Cornwall and needed my kids to be contactable. Salesman assured me phones would work. Guess what. We ve been here almost 2 months and the phones are as good as useless. The kids have no reception at all. They cannot use their phones. Most areas of Cornwall are not covered by reception for them.  I ve another year of paying for phones that cannot be used. I ve left it till now so we can check reception around Cornwall.  It s disgusting. £30 a month for NOTHING. I ve either got to start up a new contract with another company and pay you or not have reception for my kids. I m not happy at all.					2016-08-01T06:25:05+0000	1470032705	2016-08-01 08:25:05	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We bought a Toshiba television just over a year ago and it s just stopped working; the TV is in excellent condition. I looked on the internet to see whether there was a solution to getting the TV working again and I discovered that Toshiba TV s are notorious for switching off and on randomly and just breaking. So Tesco stock a brand that they must know is defective because they do their research on products before selling them.  I contacted Tesco who gave me an email address to send the details to and was told they d be in touch. They didn t bother to get in touch  I contacted them again a few days later where a decision on my television had been made (they just didn t bother to contact me to tell me what the outcome was). According to Tesco there is no guarantee that a television will last more than a year; really?  They have offered me just over a third of what the television is worth and I m expected to fork out the rest. I was given no option of a repair or replacement and no explanation what was wrong with the TV (these are technical experts who work in this department apparently). I asked to have the contract details to lodge a complaint and according to the person I spoke to there is no avenue to complain other than Trading Standards.  Trading Standards told me to go in-store where the TV was bought from and ask to see their terms and conditions  read them then make a formal complaint to Tesco; I did and the girl on the customer desk looked confused  had to ask a colleague who informed us they were wrote on the back of the receipt; they re not. I went on their website and searched for television terms and conditions and only t&c s for special offers came up. I then searched just terms and conditions and they came up but only related to statutory rights where a third party seller is involved.  Tesco clearly don t care about selling potential defective goods to their customer s. They still stock Toshiba with it s known television faults  I expect they buy the televisions with a known defect at a very low price and in my opinion intentionally rip their customers off. I won t be shopping their again and I ll be sure to tell people why.					2016-08-01T05:22:47+0000	1470028967	2016-08-01 07:22:47	1	3	2	1	6	3	3	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0
