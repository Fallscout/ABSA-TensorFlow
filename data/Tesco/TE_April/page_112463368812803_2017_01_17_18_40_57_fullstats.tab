I was browsing the paper  just to check all the supplements are there.  Secuirty guard approached me and become very abusive!  I was shocked at the way I as spoken too and the way I was treated.  I have shopped at this store of years  all the staff are friendly and nice.  I asked to speak to the Manager and asked his name.  The security guard became very aggressive and refused to disclose either.  My 15 year old nephew was with me as well and had to watch this and also the security guard said that  I stinked  as well in th whole store which was deeply embarrasing and humilating.   I am a Tesco Shareholder and also worked with Tesco directors in a professional capacity.   If this is the way Tesco treats its customers then I am taking my custom elsewhere and I a complaint email is on its way to Dave Lewis!					2016-04-30T22:34:05+0000	1462055645	2016-05-01 00:34:05	1	9	1	0	10	9	4	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He went out of his way to make sure we got our groceries following a comedy of errors on our part  and I m sure he must have spent more than our allotted time on us. Yet  despite us inconveniencing him  he was cheerful  helpful and professional; he s a credit to Tesco.  We truly appreciate his efforts  thank you.					2016-04-30T21:12:15+0000	1462050735	2016-04-30 23:12:15	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The car park was an obstacle course with trollies parked across the roadway in four different parts of the car park.  When I went into the shop the manager didn t reply to the PA system  I was left standing for nearly 5 minutes.  When I did eventually speak to her she laughed - not very professional.  The shop was messy and dirty  do you really expect people to shop there?  I know I wont be going back.					2016-04-30T20:10:42+0000	1462047042	2016-04-30 22:10:42	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I had to call in a plumber as there has been a smell of sewage in my house for a couple of weeks. They took up the floor at the back of my house and found such a bad blockage that there was sewerage leaking out of the cavities in my walls and about a foot of stagnant water under my floorboards. When they pulled up the manhole cover it was absolutely stuffed with biodegradable wipes.  They told me that the flushable wipes we have been using should never be flushed down the toilet as they do not break down as advertised.   It has been a very expensive and stressful day  and apparently this is a very common problem that they see all the time. I would appreciate it if you could consider changing the misleading information on the packaging of your  flushable  toddler wipes.					2016-04-30T19:22:58+0000	1462044178	2016-04-30 21:22:58	3	7	4	0	11	7	5	2	3	0	3	1	0	0	0	0	0

This is absolutely mortifying and I will never shop from here again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13133126_10209212171404039_2046465390385653446_n.jpg?oh=b245061fa0dfad411870ab1bcf3e07e9&oe=5909DE7C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13133126_10209212171404039_2046465390385653446_n.jpg?oh=7b7ae0611912549432fdb0821ae670af&oe=591C3871	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209212171404039&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-30T18:44:55+0000	1462041895	2016-04-30 20:44:55	11	5	12	0	17	4	3	1	10	0	11	0	0	0	0	1	0

This was from a 12 can multi pack  dated 09/2018. The can is not damaged in anyway  no dents or any visual signs for which air could get in. I have always bought this product as it s usually good quality until now. This was the last tin in the multi pack so I m concerned about the quality of the food in the other tins in the pack for which my dogs have already consumed. How is it possible for this product to have passed suitable for consumption?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13103391_10156686913475012_1925619714445952324_n.jpg?oh=287cf0395b7b02838c09e38ccccf9be4&oe=5923BD7B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13103391_10156686913475012_1925619714445952324_n.jpg?oh=e0fa96a223a7e89f59e1e05d34b496d2&oe=5923E676	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156686913475012&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-30T18:37:07+0000	1462041427	2016-04-30 20:37:07	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The road is extremely slippery in the wet  no grip what so ever  the surface is so flat it even has a shine to it. I Applied my breaks going down hill to the junction and my motorcycle slipped away from underneath me and I ve seriously hurt my leg!  So many cars struggle for grip on that piece of road  you seriously need to address this as it s a major safety issue. If someone stepped out in front of a car crossing the road there is no way a car could stop in time.					2016-04-30T17:47:38+0000	1462038458	2016-04-30 19:47:38	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She cut her thumb really bad. Amanda was on a till when I was frantically running past the tills panicking because my daughter thumb was pouring blood out!  She was amazing from the minute she noticed something was up  calmed my daughter down and also me  I must admit I was also in tears. What an amazing lady!

However a good willed woman went out of her way to follow me out the store to give me my phone back.  It doesn t sound a lot but this woman has really made my day and has shown that there is some good hearted  honest people still out there. Yes  even in Chesterfield! It s a long shot but I want to try and find her so I can thank her again as I couldn t really stop and talk for long. This was around 2.30pm today (Saturday 30th April 2016).

We went today to do a bucket shake for Larkmead School in Abingdon to raise money to run a summer school for disadvantaged children.  As we walked in  we saw a wonderful tombola display that Tesco s had set up for us. Every penny raised today will go to our fund. I didn t know anything about it  but was overwhelmed. The sheer volume and quality of prizes were fantastic! The students and I have left now  but the wonderful team at Tesco s are going to carry on raising money for us and sell tombola tickets all afternoon. They are bringing whatever money they raise into school on Tuesday.  I am so grateful for the staff and Tesco s for being so generous with their prizes and with their staff s time and energy  raising this money for us.  Can t thank you all enough!

After travelling to your store with my 7 week old daughter you can imagine my shock at being told you only had 1 trolley to accommodate a car seat. One of your larger stores and you have 1 trolley that I can use?! And why do you have 1? Because all the others broke. Such a big company  yet you can t even bother to ensure you have enough trolleys to accommodate your customers? How are people supposed to shop? Needless to say I ll be spending my £100 elsewhere and I doubt I will return. What s the point in wasting my time travelling 15miles  and I ve still no shopping?!

My other half was in on his own while I was out and was feeding our 3 month old baby when the driver knocked on the door with our delivery. He was nice enough to let my other half finish feeding the little one and then kindly helped bring the bags into the house and also gave my baby some wonderful attention.

I then arranged for a day s holiday from work and asked a TV engineer to come today to set up my Sky on the TV.  When completing my purchase  I forgot to add the £20 discount  so I then ordered a second TV and . I then telephoned your support centre to cancel my first order and was told by your operative  she would cancel the second order and refund me the £20. I asked her to ensure my delivery date was still today  she assured me it would be.  I called your support service this morning  to gain an update as to what time my delivery would arrive. I was told by a man  my delivery was delayed  he said it would not arrive until Monday. He said he could cancel my order and re-order to allow me to collect it from my local store. He said he would do this and call me once completed. After one hour and he had not called  I called your support centre again. (Meanwhile; I had raised a complaint online.) I was told by the second man  my TV would not arrive until Tuesday  due to the bank holiday. I asked why the first man had not called me and was told that due to my online complaint  he had been told not to arrange delivery to my local store. I then asked to speak with a manager as I could not believe  the way I  as a customer  was being treated.  A duty manager came on the line and told me  she would arrange delivery for tomorrow  30th April. I asked  who was going to pay the cancellation fee for the TV engineer and I was told that Tesco would not be responsible for this as it was not a legal matter.  I am now awaiting a call from the duty manager  to confirm my delivery tomorrow.  I am sending you this correspondence  as I feel you should be made aware of the way your committed customers are being treated and I would welcome your response.  During 2014  I had a similar online experience with your company and I swore then  I would never order from your site again. This is my first time  trying again and will absolutely  be my last.  Many thanks for taking the time to read my complaint.  Best   Catherine Murphy FCIPD					2016-04-30T09:22:35+0000	1462008155	2016-04-30 11:22:35	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday the lady at customer service didn t even give me a hello or goodbye  no interaction at all  and today I go in to the pfs and exactly the same thing no hello or goodbye  completely dis-interterested practically get my clubcard chucked back on the counter  at me with my items. I understand Retail  I manage a retail shop so I know the importance of customer service..  At a time with massive competition from discounters you would think as a company Tesco would teach customer service!					2016-04-30T09:19:24+0000	1462007964	2016-04-30 11:19:24	1	3	1	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last night I went to get fuel & the pump for some reason wouldn t accept my debit card.  It was nearing 10pm to when it closed & he opened up a pump that he d locked so that I could get fuel  this pump wouldn t work for me either. At this point I was panicking as I didn t have enough fuel to get home :(  I scraped together £4 in cash & Alex then used his own bank card so that I could get home.  This guy is an absolute credit to your store!!					2016-04-30T07:57:23+0000	1462003043	2016-04-30 09:57:23	16	11	17	3	31	11	8	3	18	0	16	1	0	0	0	0	0

One of the links of the bracelet broke and the watch slipped off my wrist without my noticing it. My partner retrieved it for me the following day. When I bought that Storm watch 22 years ago  the bracelet was too large and one link was removed. I kept that small link all that time  just in case   and yesterday I managed to replace the broken link with it. Here is my watch - good as new.

An older gentleman who was frail and a little confused was being served at the til and had mistakenly brought coins that were a mix of UK coins and foreign tender  and therefore didn t have enough to pay for his shopping.  Carol  the staff member serving him  explained to him clearly what had happened and swiftly offered to personally pay for his shopping so he didn t have to worry about it. She didn t make a fuss  she just did it and told him not to worry although he insisted he d be in to pay her back tomorrow.  She was fantastic and deserves recognition for going above and beyond for this customer...this act of kindness has totally restored my faith in humanity x					2016-04-29T20:34:34+0000	1461962074	2016-04-29 22:34:34	4043	161	4247	353	4761	159	145	14	171	0	3999	185	15	0	0	1	0

In about 20 hours I had a brand new replacement delivered to my door. This is brilliant customer service above and beyond what I was expecting give your self a well deserved slap on the back #Tesco. A lot of other company s could learn something here.					2016-04-29T20:26:42+0000	1461961602	2016-04-29 22:26:42	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst I don t normally buy pre prepared food as I was going on holiday I thought an instant meal would be good.  I purchased some bourbon glazed ribs and some tesco coleslaw and potato salad. Even though I followed the instructions to the letter the meat was mainly fat and gristle. The bourbon sauce was chemical tasting and synthetic. The potatoes in the salad were undercooked and inedible and the coleslaw was tasteless.  Yet again Tesco hit the gutter with their food and every time I give them another chance their mediocrity stoops to an all time low. Before you ask I haven t kept the packaging as it s now in my bin underneath the foul food I foolishly spent my money on. When is tesco going to actually put some muscle behind the customer journey and stop expecting their customers to follow them like sheep. Is this why aldi and lidl are beating you? I am old enough to remember when the Tesco promise was  pile it high sell it cheap   nothing has changed.  You clearly employ the unemployable and provide little training and most of your employees see it as a job and not a vocation or a career. Hang your head in shame Tesco					2016-04-29T19:14:25+0000	1461957265	2016-04-29 21:14:25	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was so kind and showed me how it was escalator safe and even demonstrated that it had a break.  On exiting the store once I had completed my shopping I seen the kind Manama thanked him once again. It was hale stoning and he came to my car and waited whilst I put each child in the car seat then helped me put my shopping in my car boot before he said he would take the trolley back.

I was on scene  surrounded by the air ambulance ambulances fire engines police cars   when the delivery driver called to say he was at my house. I explained what was going on and he said he would try to rearrange delivery. Not only was my shopping redelivered but I received this gorgeous bunch of flowers from them too.

However after noticing this for the first time I am utterly shocked!! And that s just for half a meal! So you are selling meals that contain 124% of an adults recommended calorie intake  in one meal!! Maybe I should of cut out breakfast and lunch today!! And I don t even want to look at the fat and salt content! Talk about a heart attack waiting to happen! I d be better off eating 2 meals from McDonalds!!

I m writing to you whilst trying to stop my tongue from burning! I have just cooked one of these pizzas for my 2 year old and have taken a bite and can only assume that the amount of spice on this pizza is going to send me into labour shortly! Why are you putting cayenne pepper and chilli powder Into your kids pizzas? I m a chef and know that you don t need either spice to make a decent tomato sauce for the base! Luckily my little boy either didn t get a piece that was this spicy or his taste buds enjoy it!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13077087_10153426335270689_5866490528941585696_n.jpg?oh=a294d3b212198e68448fa535520dc58d&oe=592467F8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13077087_10153426335270689_5866490528941585696_n.jpg?oh=602a6a80baf189c460843fc78d9c6fcd&oe=590B5DF5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153426335270689&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-29T16:28:10+0000	1461947290	2016-04-29 18:28:10	0	10	0	0	10	10	4	6	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am a scouter and was shopping for a camp this weekend with two other scouters. Two of us had our toddlers with us. My own child after shopping for 2 hours was very irritable and tired and the young guy Matthew on the till instead of shying away which is what we usually get when he s like that was more than friendly. He got my child round beside him to help scan through the shopping making him feel very important. As a parent who knows how easy it is to get stressed and emotional whilst shopping with a toddler just wanted to say a huge heartfelt thank you. Your kindness to my son did not go unnoticed ☺					2016-04-29T14:37:42+0000	1461940662	2016-04-29 16:37:42	134	40	137	6	183	40	26	14	67	0	128	3	0	0	0	0	0

I was most disgusted to find my cheese in this state when opening it today  it put me right off wanting to eat cheese on toast!! (I only brought it Monday so very much in date!)   What s even more disappointing is when returning it to store I was told because I don t have my receipt  I wasn t able to return it but I could sent a email to customer services!!

Im a disabled driver with a blue badge and have the right to park in your disabled bay and do my shopping but as I walked off away from my car I noticed one of your staff talking to a car and saw that staff member take down my registration number It looked like I was getting booked! He didn t even look to see if I had a badge! Then I had to deal with your staff calling my registration number over the mic to find out it was due to where I was parked and had to explain myself twice to your staff members and one of them wanted me to go back outside and get the staff member that had done my car. I said no you ll have to go and get them iv got a walking disability. So had to explain my spinal condition to them twice! I was so embarrassed I didn t even get an apology!  I have autism to so was highly embarrassed. An apology would of been nice when I hadn t done anything wrong! Not all disabilities are visible these days!					2016-04-29T13:42:28+0000	1461937348	2016-04-29 15:42:28	0	1	0	2	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst I didn t take them up on the offer as I had almost finished it was very much appreciated.  It s the first time we ve been  able to use one of these as they are always busy but it was a big hit with my 2 year old and until he fell asleep made his shopping trip fun 😊👍					2016-04-29T13:08:40+0000	1461935320	2016-04-29 15:08:40	9	5	9	0	14	5	3	2	4	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

They used to be perfect  perfect fit  no leaks etc. I have used them since my little one was born and had no problems  now they leak after not being that wet and leave the crystal gel bits on her skin. They are also a poorer fit. Scrolling through I see many parents have the same issue!! Surely you should be listening to the parents who were loyal to these nappies and change them back  why fix something which wasn t broken?! Not a happy customer 😡					2016-04-29T13:07:47+0000	1461935267	2016-04-29 15:07:47	2	4	2	0	6	4	2	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have used tesco nappies for 4 years as found them better than other brands  however my son has woken up 4 times recently absolutely soaked through. The changes have not been positive! Time to find new nappies  very disappointing!					2016-04-29T12:56:31+0000	1461934591	2016-04-29 14:56:31	3	9	3	0	12	9	3	6	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was saddened to see that they ve had a redesign which is slightly positive but mostly negative.  The positive part of the redesign is the now more elasticated back - I felt that this was what let down the previous nappy so am happy to see this feature. The negatives however way outweigh the positives - the nappies are smaller in size  the blue absorbent core is greatly reduced in size  as is the main absorbent bit  the side frills don t seem to be as big and the top part of the nappy doesn t go up as high/folds over very easily exposing the absorbent core to be in contact with clothes regardless of how careful I am in dressing my child. There is no mention of this massive redesign on the packaging and you are still showing the awards you have won for the nappy even though it has been massively changed so is misleading. Having spoken with a friend who has a slightly younger daughter than my son and shown her the comparison  she has commented that the blue core would be useless with how her daughter wees - down. It s not so bad for my son who wees more to the front. We both agreed that the fact that the core doesn t go any where near as far up the back will lead to way more poo leaks that go up the back. I am lucky that my son is weaning and so his bowel movements are more solid but I do worry for if they ever become loose as the nappy won t do it s job at that point and he will leak. As it is  my son can t wear them as long as they aren t able to cope as well with his wee so I ve found I m changing him more frequently (this being down to the apparent reduced size of the core.  Even though I know you as a company will already know of the comparisons  I attach comparison photos that are quite obviously different. Given the size difference  I am now going to have to go and exchange for a larger size  reducing the amount of nappies we get per pack  even though I know he is a size 3 everywhere else. I can t be the only person to notice this difference?!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13096332_10153748850633515_6490333848746100810_n.jpg?oh=0531406ad84c9220c074014d2a6d5758&oe=59196B36	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q83/p720x720/13096332_10153748850633515_6490333848746100810_n.jpg?oh=321a2b2de3163e4928a4a8632ba6eaca&oe=59069C7B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153748850633515&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-29T12:49:02+0000	1461934142	2016-04-29 14:49:02	3	8	3	0	11	7	2	5	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Was told on the delivery notes that the intercom does not work  but the driver did not try once to call. Every other shop I ve had online shopping from has managed to do this no problem. I know that they had my number as had always received a text to say the delivery would be late.					2016-04-29T08:38:28+0000	1461919108	2016-04-29 10:38:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered 8 pieces of furniture 2 weeks ago to be delivered yesterday during tesco special offeers.  Thought it was an amazing deal... but only 2 out of 8 got delivered and had email confirmations cancelling the other 6 on the afternoon of the delivery date.   Discount now ended  I can t buy similar products and have to pay full price. Seems like a scam to sell goods which cannot be fulfilled and then cancel with no notice on the day of delivery.   ** Watch out  Furniture brought on TescoDirect TWO weeks ago may not be fulfilled and you won t be informed until day of delivery**  #BrokenDreams  #FalsePromotion					2016-04-28T20:23:01+0000	1461874981	2016-04-28 22:23:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in to collect a prescription and the pharmacist there asked how I was doing with the medication and then proceeded to ask if I would like to talk (I was about to burst into tears after the GP didn t really listen to me). She then took me into a private room and talked me through lots of different options and ways to try and overcome my illness (I suffer from anxiety) and told me to come back for a chat whenever I needed. What an amazing person Dorota Kaworska is- it s not often you meet people in their profession that really care and make a difference to people.

I got bored very quickly and I made my own fun by hiding in the toilet rolls  stacking up the shampoo bottles  putting random items in mummy s trolley and announcing  I need a wee  when mummy had just filled most of the trolley. I became a little cross when mummy said we didn t have enough pennies for the  Iron man figure  and said please about 100 times  I did eventually give up  when I realised mummy had a sad face and I gave mummy a kiss and then ran down the aisle two times  running up an aisle and then waiting to see if mummy can catch me  with a huge trolley is definitely my favourite game!! Mummy must of said my name a zillion times  I think this might of been because I was the winner and she wasn t. By the time we got to you which mummy said had been about two hours  but felt like three weeks  mummy looked tired  she even thought that she should just leave the trolley because of the thought of having to load it all on the conveyer belt. You must of seen that I was getting into mischief when I was playing   closed now  and began opening and shutting the gates to the till next to you. So you asked me if I would like to help you! Wow  this was the best game! I got to hold the scanner and scan the items and we worked together  you let me scan some and we took turns. Mummy was smiling and looked really happy because I got to be a big boy and be a special helper.   I wanted you to know that I had a great time and I really enjoyed scanning the items with you. This has made me really happy.  Mummy says you were fantastic  patient and went above and beyond to help Mummy.  Thank you Danielle.

When I got to the till I was selected for a ranDom check yet again  every other time I shop there I am selected this is not random. The lady took our trolley to oneside and checked even item  then accused us of not scanning two items. I always check when I scan an item it shows on the screen. The lady said well we ll see what ghee computer says in an accusing manner. I was me to feel like a common their that scanner must have been faulty because each item I put in my bags were scanned. Shall never use that store again. She said the amount for the two items was £2.25  which was for a chicken and bacon Kiev priced at £3 and a tiger baguette priced at 0.75p  proof the scanner is faulty. Shot with Whit products  short shelf life or out of date fruit and veg. Black bananas sweating in bags.					2016-04-28T19:02:04+0000	1461870124	2016-04-28 21:02:04	0	6	0	0	6	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When we ve had them previously they have always been quite meaty and the meat just falls off the bone  very little gristle. Tonight we cooked them same as always  as per the instructions  and my partners was fine  however mine was awful. I could barely even get the meat off the bone and the bits I did were very tough and had a lot of gristle in them  which resulted in me not eating them and not enjoying my meal at all.  I hope this was a one off however it s really put me off getting them again. I m not usually one to complain but as it s something I usually enjoy  along with been on a tight budget  I just wanted to make my thoughts known.

Food shopping near bedtime with an especially  busy  toddler. Armed with two trolleys and my husband as back up we placed the small child in a trolley pushed by hubby and I had my very own to dash around. The child lasted in the strapped trolley for approximately 46 seconds before throwing herself into the actual trolley. Husband stopped off at the free children s fruit stand and grabbed a banana (excellent idea!). Not even 3 minutes in the child had started shouting for mamma and I threw husband a pound with the instructions to buy her chocolate to keep her quiet for another few valuable minutes. I dashed as quickly as a 7 month pregnant mother could shoving items in my trolley that won t make a meal. Meeting husband I found he had also shoved things in his trolley meaning we had double of everything. I then decided the child was getting a little bit too distressed in the trolley cage and smiled at my husband and said  she will be ok to walk now  he looked at me like the idiot that I was. Small child dived for the pick and mix stand and I was forced to wrestle her away. Giving up on being able to think about proper meals I head for the freezer isle and stocked up on all the stuff I swore I would never feed my child but do  daily. Fish fingers  smiley faces and peas thrown in quickly we headed for the tills. Small child was now very wild and even the usual activity of helping putting things on the till was not sufficient in containing her and she began to run wild. She headed for the doors before I could get her she was stopped by a very quick security lady (thanks so much). Chucking everything on the tills the lady on the tills  Jan  offered her services as a Tesco Angel. She managed to talk my toddler into helping her behind the tills. This miraculously worked and the whole nightmare of shopping sailed much more smoothly. Isabelle smiled  my blood pressure came down and she chatted and smiled like we were not the worst customers she had dealt with all day like I know we were. So tescos in Brigg  please make Jan employee of the month she deserves it and we will be back soon  hopefully with a better behaved child!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13100796_10154049384782165_8580606222273812680_n.jpg?oh=c5c6543333f18990976066bdf210d85a&oe=59088A60	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13100796_10154049384782165_8580606222273812680_n.jpg?oh=a8f77442894a778236385453daf8c8a9&oe=5906026D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154049384782165&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-28T18:20:08+0000	1461867608	2016-04-28 20:20:08	3025	326	3206	174	3706	303	123	180	926	0	2987	148	3	27	0	0	0

I m also fairly sure the racket they make is not good for a tiny person s ears. Some simple hand towels would be far preferable so that I can avoid having to dry my hands on my jeans. Many thanks.					2016-04-28T18:14:00+0000	1461867240	2016-04-28 20:14:00	2	18	2	0	20	14	8	6	13	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

In her possession she had with her a bottle of Prosecco purchased from Sainsbury. She went to the sandwich display and selected a sandwich before going to the self service checkout. She did not go near the alcohol in your store instead paying for her sandwich before leaving with her purchase. She was then followed out of the store by a member of staff and escorted back in. She in full view of the public was called a thief and accused of stealing the wine. When her receipt was produced she was released. She did call and spoke to the store manager who promised a letter of apology which has not arrived. Tesco how dare you stop innocent people and tarnish their good name? Accusing them of stealing and then don t have the decency to apologise in writing. Shame on you disgusting behaviour.					2016-04-28T17:26:19+0000	1461864379	2016-04-28 19:26:19	2	2	4	0	6	2	2	0	1	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0

I go today to try and move the appointment nearer as he needs them to drive to work and do his job - Up to now even with the messing about and numerous phone calls i was only a little frustrated so i popped  in the store to see if they could be any more helpful only to be served by a  tutting eye rolling  assistant who this was just too much trouble for - i did explain i didn t blame her personally but due to her attitude i eventually walked away Thank Goodness for Focus Optics who stepped in without a blink of an eye (sorry couldn t resist that)					2016-04-28T15:58:32+0000	1461859112	2016-04-28 17:58:32	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why did I bother?!  I placed an order last Tuesday morning (19th April) to be collected between 4pm-6pm. I went though the payment process and all went through fine. Got to the store at 4pm to pick up my shopping to be told my payment didn t go through because the card on my Tesco account was one I no longer used and hadn t realised as it all went through ok. I didn t have my bag with me as just rushed out thinking I was picking up shopping then rushing back to work. So had no means to pay. So I had to unload all the shopping I d just loaded out of my boot and was told I d be called later on. Which I wasn t. So I called customer service myself and spent time changing my address and going through the day s events and was offered £5 voucher which I didn t think was helpful as I needed my shopping not £5. I was then asked  what would you like me to do?  I wanted to make payment over the phone but was told that was possible so the gentlemen I spoke with tried to put me through to the bedford 1 store and no answer so again was told I d be called back but I m still waiting now over a week later!!   It s supposed to make your life easier and quicker but this wasn t the case with me. I completely understand that sometimes things don t go as smoothly as usual which is fine. However I do believe it s how a problem is dealt with. And this problem was not dealt with in any kind of manner I would expect so I will more than likely never use click and collect again for the pure headache it caused me.  I d like to know what would be the appropriate way to deal with this?					2016-04-28T14:54:38+0000	1461855278	2016-04-28 16:54:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It doesn t take rocket science to realise you are fading out  value  foods & are replacing with new brands.. Labelled different as farm grading names. I went into my very regular tescos Amersham & had this confirmed by the lovely Di on customer services. Why do people feel the need to moan? I just don t get. Value.. Bottom shelf.. Standard.. Middle shelf.. Organic top shelf.. It s that simple. I shop accordingly..  But I must confess the  farm  names lead you to believe that things are  a little  healthier/better  than they really are. Thanks for all that you do & pls take previous comments on board 👍🏼👍🏼					2016-04-28T14:52:01+0000	1461855121	2016-04-28 16:52:01	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Once the senior staff member came over he seen the voucher and tried to make me look like a fool saying we don t accept sainsbury s voucher only tesco does a brand guarantee and kept pointing at the brand match guarantee sign board his spoken English was very poor and couldn t pronounce the word guarantee so I was trying to reason with someone who was apparently senior member of staff but couldnt communicate properly. I tried reasoning but he wouldn t accept nor scan the voucher  because he would ve been embarrassed to see that it did actually work and that what he was actually saying to me was a load of gibberish.  I didn t get to use  it there and eventually when I said you will get a lot of customers after the sainsbury s use by deadline coming instore to use he then replied and changed his disgusting tone that no one made him aware higher above so if he wanted to he could ve asked to let me use my voucher I would ve left happily thinking at least he tried but no instead he tried no act clever as if he knew the regulationals infront of the unaware till lady and two other close by till workers. He was an Asian man of around 5ft9 height and had a headset on he is easily recognisible and usually found hovering around the tills area and self checkout area of the store					2016-04-28T11:05:09+0000	1461841509	2016-04-28 13:05:09	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You stopped selling it in your stores  and then relaunched it with slightly different shades as an online product on just the tesco direct website called Barbara Daly s trade secrets. Now those are not showing as being available either?!  What is going on? Will you be selling them again?  It feels like you are on the verge of shutting up shop.  So many things that I used to buy are no longer available from yourselves!					2016-04-28T10:47:10+0000	1461840430	2016-04-28 12:47:10	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the main regarding date issues on cream. They say  as fresh as you would pick yourself  and in the majority of cases this is probably correct. Today  the delivery driver told us that his manager had said  we re getting too many complaints from 1 address  (ours possibly as he was talking to us!)  so get them to check it all and if there is anything they re not happy with they can return it and do a refund right away  With attitudes like that from the driver s manager  no wonder Tesco are losing customers. I have been spending around £100 a week (trying to cut down so has been in the £70 s for last 2 weeks!)  That s it Tesco  no more!					2016-04-28T10:41:06+0000	1461840066	2016-04-28 12:41:06	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The gentleman who delivered my groceries today (I don t use the term Gentleman loosely ) was fantastic. He not only placed everything on my work tops so I didn t have to bend or lift  he even unpacked the trays and cleared away. People are quick to complain however I am quick to praise.

I would just like to let you know how amazing one of your staff memebers was to me... In your Tesco Extra Store on Caerleon Road  Newport you have a lovely lady who works for you called Mandy and i often see her in store. One day last week i was inbetween hospital visits with my husband as he is unwell and i had my 2 boys with me at the self serve tills & like most children they were abit to eager to have their treats & were trying to take the chocolate before the til had recognised the weight. Finally managed to get it sorted but as i got abit distracted and rushing at the same time i totally forgot to collect my 10pound change. When it was brought to Mandy s attention by another customer she tried to catch me up but i had already gone so she put the money safe for me as she new i would be back in at some point then to my surprise on tuesday (this week) she stopped me and handed me back my money 😊 Amazingly honest of her and a very good deed  as i was convinced i had lost it... i have taken in a bunch of flowers for her to say Thank You and just thought you should know to 😊	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13119117_10204580456870956_5424625624813033683_n.jpg?oh=2f7cac34ab715a439f2732cb3c8755e8&oe=59229095	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13119117_10204580456870956_5424625624813033683_n.jpg?oh=0aad919888be8b5706f1ecd3c6a5ae44&oe=59234F98	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204580456870956&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-28T09:36:22+0000	1461836182	2016-04-28 11:36:22	110	14	112	6	132	14	9	5	17	0	105	2	0	0	0	0	0

I found a store assistant and asked his advice  he recommended the oil and asked if I was ok putting it in  of course i said no as i have no clue so he asked if i would like help. He came out to car park and filled my car with oil and checked it was to the right level I was so pleased.  I would just like to say what lovely customer service the hexham store has as this isnt the first time they have gone out the way to help me.  From a happy tesco customer					2016-04-28T07:46:33+0000	1461829593	2016-04-28 09:46:33	5	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Like the aunt Bessie s and bisto range. They have all just disappeared. If this keeps happening and as well as the Clubcard boost I may as well shop elsewhere as there s nothing worth shopping at tescos anymore I may as well go back sainsburys and get my nectar points up cos at least they do events through the year to double up your points.					2016-04-28T06:12:02+0000	1461823922	2016-04-28 08:12:02	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Seeing as it is the last one you might at least include everything. If Tesco need to save money  then so be it. I d rather that than they go bust because it s my favourite supermarket. But please  include everything in the boost. I don t need them to pay for meals or days out and I don t need toys and if I want a hairdryer or electric toothbrush and the like  it s not difficult for me to get one anywhere. No doubt it ll all be out of stock the first day anyway. I do think that for the Christmas savers it would ve been better to give people fair warning at least. I had no idea it was coming.					2016-04-28T00:25:49+0000	1461803149	2016-04-28 02:25:49	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I proceeded to enter my pin number but whilst doing this was told  a simple please and thank you would be nice !!!!!  All this because I didn t say thank you to him for telling me the total of the bill  I was speechless!  Having spent 16 years at the front end of retail  I am always very courteous in shops as I totally understand how down right vile some customers can be.  I ran my own retail business for a few years during which time we were awarded Best Shopping Experience so I really dont take kindly at 46 years old being told by a member of staff how to conduct my manners!  I always say thank you as I leave the till  please get your staff trained on how to conduct their own manners at the till point  well some of them anyway!

Has there been some sort of issue with your branded (green packet ) nappies?   I ve been using them over the past 10 months with no issues- they were great the best idea used by far! However over the past 3 weeks I ve noticed that there have been clear crystals left on my sons skin from the nappies each time I ve changed him.   I persisted with use but it has been happening when the nappy is hardly even used (no dampness )  I ve spoken to other mums on a Facebook group for our area (Bangor Co Down ) and many are having similar problems.   Just wanted to make you aware of the issue - i dont want to have to start using another brand so hopefully my next packet are fine and its not going to be an ongoing issue   Chloe					2016-04-27T18:59:35+0000	1461783575	2016-04-27 20:59:35	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Way to go Tesco  how to make someone feel welcome. I did ask a member of staff if it would be possible to actually buy some but when she finally raised her head to look at me during this conversation she told me this couldnt be done. No signs around the make up area advising customers you dont trust them. No  you leave it to the customers to do a hunt around the store to work out what time sales of this item cease  and the reason why. Still  Boots the Chemist was open and I wasnt treated as a potential shoplifter so alls well that ends well.					2016-04-27T18:59:29+0000	1461783569	2016-04-27 20:59:29	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This happens continuously - the latest item to be given the heave ho being Tiptons Quince Jelly.  I was so pleased when I first saw this product on the shelf a while ago as I previously always had to order it online.  However  it s now apparently discontinued  so it s back to ordering online from another supplier.  I could list a whole load of different items that have gone the same way - it s really not good enough!! When I m cooking for a dinner party I get so fed up of not being able to get everything I want in your store - soooo annoying!!!  I can t even get the extra strong 50 litre pedal bin liners anymore - not good enough 😬					2016-04-27T18:33:37+0000	1461782017	2016-04-27 20:33:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Once again  vegan products disappeared from your shelves and just empty space.  I absolutely love the vegan free from choice ices and the strawberry cones (as do many other people who don t eat dairy).. and was so looking forward to them last night. Empty shelf!  And again tonight.. empty shelf!  It really puts you off a store that runs its products down so low or has such poor stock management that it has EMPTY shelves for two days running!!  Please do something about it.					2016-04-27T18:02:11+0000	1461780131	2016-04-27 20:02:11	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

On visiting your store today I purchased a months worth of shopping  plus clothes etc extra. On going to the till  I was having to carry my 4 month old as he had fell asleep in my arms. I went to a checkout which was empty and started to load up the shopping on to the belt. The cashier decided not to give me time to empty my trolley but to start scanning it through piling it up at the end of the till. She never asked if i once wanted help with my packing. She just kept stacking it up. Once I had finally got my shopping on to the belt I proceeded to the end and she asked me if I would like any bags. I did and purchased some. Still  no ask of help with packing. I then proceeded to pack. One handed may I add and try and get it all in to my trolley. Still holding my 4 month old. She didn t stop to even let me catch up. She just kept piling it up. What more... She got up off her chair to bring items scanned to the gap at the bottom of the till. Sat back down and kept scanning. I finally got all my shopping packed  my total was over £150! So I have just spent £150 plus in your store and your cashier couldn t even be bothered to help me pack? Seeing I was struggling. I am not happy and I would like a response. Thank you.   Faye Lippitt					2016-04-27T16:51:22+0000	1461775882	2016-04-27 18:51:22	0	12	0	0	12	11	11	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You have recently changed the recipe and the bread itself!! £1.80 a loaf is a staggering amount for a load that is only 380g but unfortunately my other half is polish and can not stand English bread !!! Before the recipe change it was delicious and real sourdough now it s horrid!! The otter skin is different and the cut in the top is awful!! Before it has 3 small cuts now it has a huge cut down the middle which often cuts the roof of your mouth and makes it impossible to cut ! For the past 3 days I haven t been able to buy it due to the St Andreas fault line running dow the middle!!! I was originally told via your customer service that they would check in store re baking to make sure all was being cooked correctly as its a express store i know the staff and we have had many a conversation regarding the cooking process  I have even purchased frozen and cooked myself to check it and it s the bread not the store!  Can I also add the staff at the express have been fantastic and very helpful but I am now having to complain again !!! For the fact that the store offer nothing else as a alternative and £1.80 a loaf is crazy I can easily do £10 a week just on bread!! I was told yesterday that the supplier was meant to be writing to me but I have heard nothing and I am getting fed up I feel I am being brushed off!!!					2016-04-27T16:48:44+0000	1461775724	2016-04-27 18:48:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Disgraceful! Meat out of date in one day  not told by the butcher that this was the case. Total cost of  fresh meat  was in the region of £25 and I have to throw it all away or would have had to have frozen straight away! Not what I would expect when buying supposed fresh meat from a butchers counter! I contacted your customer services department who told me that all meat purchased only ever has one day to use  if I wanted a longer  use by  for the meat I had to buy pre packed : / Offered a gesture voucher for £20 which is worth less than I paid for the meat. Beware customers when buying from Tesco s meat counter  unless you are freezing it or eating all on the day you purchase  you are wasting your money!					2016-04-27T16:23:46+0000	1461774226	2016-04-27 18:23:46	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Trying to pass the buck but if you allow people to operate business inside your stores then ultimately its your responsibility.

I asked my father to purchase some cookies from there on Monday as a super scrumptious treat for not feeling very well.  He got me the double chocolate and white chocolate bags of cookies.   I m very sad to say that these cookies did not live up to the usual high quality I have received from a Tesco cookie in frequent previous encounters.   They were dry and hard and I genuinely thought I was going to crack a tooth biting in to one of the White chocolate cookies at one point.   This is not what I expect from a Tesco cookie  or from any cookie for that matter that have been freshly baked. They should be soft and gooey.   To say I am bitterly disappointed is an understatement. As part of a family that has shopped at Tesco for as long as I can remember   I highly doubt I will be consuming your cookies or any other bakery good if this is what your stores deem as acceptable quality.   I do hope you take these points on board to avoid further customers being as deeply disappointed as I was with the bakery products.  Kind regards  Natasha					2016-04-27T14:43:40+0000	1461768220	2016-04-27 16:43:40	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please tell me why your loose bananas in your Tesco Express store in hall green b28 8ab are so manky?!!  I go in daily and it s very hit and miss on the loose banana front  recently it s been more miss/epic fail than hit.    The only options are buying an 80p multi pack which lasts a couple of days before they themselves turn to the manky side.  Plus it s a massive waste of money when I only want one or two bananas!   Please can you put me out of my banana misery!  Is there a mass overstock of manky  split  shrivelled bananas or green bananas that are so hard you could use them as a baseball bat.... Are there no normal  unblemished yellow bananas in hall green?!  Thanks in advance.					2016-04-27T12:15:13+0000	1461759313	2016-04-27 14:15:13	1	6	1	0	7	6	6	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I locked myself out of my car in their car park today with no phone  money or anything. They didn t have to but they lent me a phone and even found a number for my breakdown company. It was not part of their job but it was very greatly appreciated as I don t know what I would have done without the help.

What if you don t want to drink a can of fizzy juice or a smoothie with your lunch and you don t like sparkling water? Do no Tesco stores offer water in this deal or is it just the Redding store? Isn t water something Tesco should be encouraging people to drink rather than more sugary options? I asked at customer services but they could offer no explanation for it. Thanks.					2016-04-27T12:04:04+0000	1461758644	2016-04-27 14:04:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just want to let you know how brilliant your member of staff  Tim  is on your Isle of Man click and collect desk!   I order so much (clothes and direct) through Tesco and because of this he knows me by name and face  whenever I go in I don t have to give any details he just bobs off and grabs my parcel.   He has before seen me come into store  use your scan as your shop and bought my parcel  to me.  Last week I ordered something and when I got it home realised the box had been opened there was a part missing and the item inside was damaged  he was so helpful in ordering a replacement!  Today I went in to query why an order I placed on Monday hasn t been dispatched  he again was so helpful and has managed to get your partners to push my order  he also told me when he s next in if I don t hear from them.  I feel really bad that he gave me a feedback card thingy to fill out online and I ve managed to put it through the wash so I hope this somehow equates to the same thing!					2016-04-27T11:33:20+0000	1461756800	2016-04-27 13:33:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visit this store every single morning. This morning I was buying a little extra due to a staff party at work. This means it took a little longer for me to scan and bag my items. This is the bit that really got me..  While scanning my items there was another customer standing a bit too close for comfort (I presumed she was in a hurry so I tried to be a little quicker). She then said  Hurry up its waiting for 10p  when I was actually waiting for change to that amount. THEN she shoves in to me and tells me to move my bag  before I m even finished shopping!  Maybe the staff who were standing around open mouthed could have served her instead of making me feel rushed and embarrassed!					2016-04-27T09:38:07+0000	1461749887	2016-04-27 11:38:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

If I had more time I would and should of complained but I was heading to work. When I got to the ordering point the staff looked stressed and confused  not a good advert fir this business.

Driving down Clive Sullivan Way in Hull at 9:03 am 27/04/2016  we came across one of your  friendly  delivery drivers. She was attempting to force her way from a slip road into the main carriageway. However we had just let the car in front through so she was unable to pull out in front of us. She came out onto the carriageway behind us and proceeded to give us the V.  We don t expect this sort of behaviour from a reputable well known company like yourselves  The reg of the van was KN64 JVC  Please can I have a response  Regards					2016-04-27T08:11:54+0000	1461744714	2016-04-27 10:11:54	1	3	4	10	17	3	3	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	3	0

Not only were they much better  but also half the price of the leading rival brand. However  last week Tesco decided to change the design and they have been terrible. Every morning our daughter has woken up with the nappy having completely leaked through to her clothes and this morning we were shocked to find the nappy had burst and all the absorbent material/gel were all over her body. She could have eaten this without us knowing and we are extremely concerned and angry at Tesco for clearly not testing these products properly.

Great I thought my little GIRL will love that you have some new toys in. It turns out though that you aren t focusing on girls as it was only boys saving their mum. I m do disappointed  why did you have to make an advert with just boys playing with these toys.  Sadly we won t be popping down to our local tesco to see your range of toys. We will find a shop that wants to have her as a customer					2016-04-27T06:46:41+0000	1461739601	2016-04-27 08:46:41	5	13	5	0	18	13	4	9	8	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

This was a great way of saving money which has now been taken away.  On top of this  the Clubcard points collected by using my Tesco credit card have already been decreased  so not only can I no longer boost up  but I have less points in the first place.  Double whammy! I m seriously considering changing credit cards - realistically what do I now  gain  by using my Tesco one? Seems like you lured us in with extra Clubcard points  and boosts to make it even better   then took both away - presumably hoping we wouldn t notice as it was done at separate times.   On a separate note  I was at a friends house last night  who was expecting her delivery order. It was late again (2nd time in 2 weeks!) - and when it arrived  the receipt which the driver left behind wasn t even hers. So we could tell you exactly what another customer had ordered. Admittedly  once she had phoned to complain the driver did return with the correct paperwork  however surely this is a breach of confidentiality. The name and address of a customer being handed to another? She then discovered that the biscuits she ordered had been unavailable  but no replacement sent. Surely it can t be that hard to find an alternative to hob nobs! Given that my friend uses the delivery saver  I would suggest that maybe  again  people have been lured in to paying for this  but don t seem to be getting the service they are entitled to.  Seems like things are starting to unravel for Tesco at the moment. You need to get things sorted before you loose all your frequent customers.					2016-04-27T06:25:13+0000	1461738313	2016-04-27 08:25:13	3	8	3	0	11	7	5	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your regular customers.  Yes. US who keep you all in a job!  Delivery saver plans increased  to a £40 minimum  spend from the  original  minimum  £25 minimum spend! Delivery saver perks have been messed with  too...we have to order a minimum of  £20 now for f*$king click & collect? ??!!!! Also it has NOT gone Un - noticed that  you always put your prices up a couple  of  days before  every  boost  event!  You gave an amazing  petrol deal for almost 18 months & altho it will be missed  it WAS only a temporary  promotion so I feel that s fair play.But now??? You tell your customers they have 2 months to use all their boost vouchers??!! You KNEW people were putting their own extra money into the christmas savers club yet you still allowed these people to put THEIR money into YOUR company  (nice little amount of interest I bet that s earned you on your company  accounts! ). You are a TINY step away from actually  breaking money - laundering laws! I ve seen your  what s in & what s not  info regarding  this - the LAST boost chance  for customers! ! & I am  fuming  about the f&f clothing  being an in store only way to double up 😠 ! Not allowed to use the vouchers on f&f online!!! Be careful now  Tesco.....keep taking away perks we are all used to & expect to call the receivers in within  the next 2 or 3 years....bet BHS  never thought their day would come either...					2016-04-27T00:32:04+0000	1461717124	2016-04-27 02:32:04	4	4	4	0	8	4	2	2	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

What idiot decided to change it?					2016-04-26T21:15:41+0000	1461705341	2016-04-26 23:15:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst driving to get petrol one of the rear tyres on my car went flat and ended up with multiple punctures. I ve only recently passed my test and didn t have a clue what to do so I went and asked if anyone could help. All of your employees at the petrol station helped out so much helping and showing me how to change my tyre and I m so grateful  without them I don t know what I would have done :)					2016-04-26T20:57:25+0000	1461704245	2016-04-26 22:57:25	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

No doubt being scrapped to save money. I was hoping to boost my vouchers so that I can buy a new TV as with a boost I would get around £100 worth of vouchers. However on checking the details of the boost guess what? Yep TV s are excempt from the boost event. That is totally unfair everything should be included in the event. Thank you very much Tesco. Tesco  We never want to help  I m off to Argus to get my new TV so Tesco you have lost my custom!					2016-04-26T19:29:02+0000	1461698942	2016-04-26 21:29:02	0	8	0	0	8	7	6	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately i fond on my return home that the tob was not sealed properly  not only leaking into the shopping bag ( i have just spent 10 minutes washing my shopping) but also leaving me reticent to consume the product  who knows at what point and why the cellophane come off. I would not mind so much if this was the first time  but it is the third in as many weeks. Returning the product to store is not a reasonable option as at £2 for the goods the cost and time spent going back to broughton park is disproportionate.

This was in your Chichester store about 6:30pm and the staff member that got rudely spoke to was called Harry.   I was embarrassed for him at how degrading a fellow colleague was towards him... It was to the extent that a fellow shopper actually mentioned something to Harry about how unacceptable it was. It took place on the self service checkout after a Harry helped a customer out...admittedly Harry himself may have been slightly in the wrong as he was on shift whilst purchasing a bottle of water...but that in no way should sanction the way his colleague spoke to him!  He was also only trying to help a customer who had been waiting for this other staff member to respond!					2016-04-26T17:38:45+0000	1461692325	2016-04-26 19:38:45	0	4	0	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your Inverurie store don t keep their Direct click and collect or currency exchange open till 8 as you advertise. Well neither of them were open last night at 7.20pm.  When my mum spoke to the girl on the click and collect area today  my mum was very rudely informed that she didn t control the website!  I would say both your website and staff training on customer service need updating. Very disappointing for a store we spend a lot of time and money in.					2016-04-26T13:54:57+0000	1461678897	2016-04-26 15:54:57	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s  lovely to see points earned  going even further for day trips and entries into national amusements & restaurants etc. Sadly I live in Cornwall  and many of us use our points in store as we  have found local places to use our vouchers quite limited ( even down to the lack of selected cinema s to use a double up voucher!) There are obviously a few restaurants but maybe only 2 or 3 on the list meaning variety is poor  but the theme parks etc would require such an amount of money to be spent on travel and accommodation they make the scheme not feasible for many. My question I suppose is  is there still going to be a way to get the most out of your points in store and if not how will they be tailored to suit the areas of the country when the  big branded Tesco Clubcard partners  aren t readily avaliable so we too can still benefit from the amazing deals shopping with Tesco has to offer? Obviously again  we should be grateful for what we do get I m not saying  we aren t just sad to see something we can use dissappear!

Wrong... Despite my items being packed in about a hundred bags  two yoghurt s had burst and I ve just spent 20 minutes cleaning banana & custard yoghurt off of half the items in my order. Great idea packing them in a crate under two bags of baking potatoes. Even better  the strawberries I ordered that have arrived with a date of 28/4/2016 (two days  so kind) have two big lovely furry strawberries smack bang in the middle of the packet. Aaaaand  one of the cucumbers has a great big soggy bruise right in the middle.   I ve had delivery saver since pretty much the beginning as it was great value and I was certain I d only really shop with Tesco but it s becoming apparent that I should really be taking my business elsewhere. Totally disappointed.					2016-04-26T11:13:37+0000	1461669217	2016-04-26 13:13:37	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am not one to complain  or return items for petty reasons  but I feel that this is quite concerning. It appears to be blood  which runs through the middle of the whole banana. There is not sign of the banana being off  mouldy etc.. and I also checked some of the others in the bunch and they were fine!  I have seen articles online over the past few months  with warnings of this type of thing (explaining that banana s have been tampered with blood abroad) however  I thought nothing of it. I am not suggesting that this is the case  however  I do think it is concerning; and made me feel extremely sick. Imagine if this was in the hands of a child and they ate it anyway!  A reply would be much appreciated.

My son who was born on the 13-01-16 was extremely unwell since birth to the point that he had to be transferred from cavan to temple street children s hospital  Dublin via ambulance on a machine to help him breath. Due to having to stay in Dublin with my partner during this time I fell behind a bit on my bill repayments and to be honest I had alot more on my mind then bills..he had to operations on his airway and was incubated so a machine could breath for him. He was the diagnosed with digeorge syndrome. On the second operation we were told by the doctors performing the procedure that it was extremely dangerous what they were going to perform and unexpected things could happen.. All through this time I had set up a payment plan due to me being off work and the cost of having to stay in Dublin of €34 a week to catch up on my payments. Tesco would ring every Friday and they would take payment.. due to me being in a hospital sometimes I could not answer the phone or there was no reception. But I always rang them back when I got a chance. My son was transferred back to cavan last week as his breathing at improved and we had been trained on how to feed him through a feeding tube. We were only meant to be a few days in cavan and then home. Tesco rang Friday gone to collect payment but I had no signal to receive the call and I had to stay with my son and the bill was the last thing on my mind. When I got home Thursday I rang to pay the €34 that was overdue and they would not except payment and had disconected  my phone which I needed incase nurses or doctors had to get in touch with me about my son.  They then said they needed full payment on the account for them to reconnect my phone which was €134...I explained to them I was off work and hadn t much money and any money I had was being used on my son and to get up and down to my son.. they said there was nothing they could do and demanded full payment which I said I would make but tried to explain it would leave me with no money until next Thursday and pretty much said there was nothing they could do so I had to make payment...and I forgot to mention that I also work for tesco.

This picture was taken this morning at the junction of Bligh Way/Albatross Avenue in Strood where your driver chose to park in such a manner that cars trying to get out of junction were completely unable to see whether there was traffic coming up the hill. This is a dangerous junction at the best of times de to poor visibility being on the hill and also the speed drivers come up the road without incompetent delivery drivers causing even more problems!   The reg of the vehicle is KR14 LFF and I would appreciate if someone could please confirm to me that this driver has indeed been reprimanded for causing such danger.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13043783_10156796531090043_1483173089884682572_n.jpg?oh=240d48212e9debdf7a3fde35089b23d3&oe=591C1D70	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13043783_10156796531090043_1483173089884682572_n.jpg?oh=f3e7d1dbb71a5e3a73feaaa9bffe03f3&oe=5908597D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156796531090043&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-26T08:21:15+0000	1461658875	2016-04-26 10:21:15	2	6	2	0	8	6	3	3	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

People seem to forget we can t have it all ways. Companies cannot be expected to pay a living wage  keep prices low  have offers  as well as offer the double ups  something was bound to stop. I for one am very grateful for the double ups of the past and saw them as an extra not a God given right. If you think you can better value elsewhere then that s up to you  I for one will continue to be a Christmas Saver and am excited to see what new ways are brought in to boost my Clubcard vouchers ready for Christmas.					2016-04-26T08:11:05+0000	1461658265	2016-04-26 10:11:05	9	4	9	0	13	4	2	2	2	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

How unfair is this to customers like us who save them in your christmas scheme and only get their vouchers just before Christmas  many of who are pensioners who may rely on the voucher doubling  to  help them through Christmas. This seems unfair but maybe it was plannned that way so you get extra income at  a time guaranteed  that people spend more. I thiink it is disgraceful  the the cut  of point is mid year  and not the end of the year.					2016-04-25T21:01:26+0000	1461618086	2016-04-25 23:01:26	3	13	3	0	16	13	4	9	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Like many here  I use the double up on Christmas presents  and mine will not be writing Father Christmas letters in May  and the must have toys wont have been announced/released. I don t find the other offers good value as there are usually voucher codes for free for days out/restaurants that are close to the saving anyway. We have other financial products with Tesco that gave us extra points along with buying petrol from the petrol stations  this no longer competitive without the double up. We will unfortunately be switching to providers offering better value. I hope that you rethink the changes  good luck for the future.					2016-04-25T19:49:05+0000	1461613745	2016-04-25 21:49:05	3	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had to nip in tonight after work to pick up a stair gate. Had my 2 year old daughter with me (who was running about wild). Amongst a few other bits and bobs I had to get. I was struggling to police my 2 year old and carry my shopping & stair gate. Christine very kindly shut her checkout and carried the stair gate all the way to my car. A small gesture that made my night that little bit easier. A real credit to your team!

You clearly DO NOT listen to your customers I use it to finish up Christmas and decorations... It s saying you will have new ways to collect points? Shouldn t you have come up with that before you decided to stop the boosts? So now that s the green points for you bags and boosts you ve stopped... Will it be the points all together next? Most of the offers you send me are no use to me... The whole reason I shop at tesco is because I get something back  every little helps  hmmmm					2016-04-25T17:19:59+0000	1461604799	2016-04-25 19:19:59	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Everytime I go into tescos you never have any aptamel colic and constipation milk. My son needs this and to be told that you don t order a lot in is very worrying. My nearest tescos is lurgan and everytime I go in there is none. I then tried Craigavon there was none there also. I was then told that I would have to travel to Lisburn if I wanted the milk as they had 4 left in stock..RIDICULOUS! Do you not think you should stock up on this milk as colic is very common in babies so I have no idea why you d wouldn t order a good amount in.

I have been using tesco nappies for about 4 years for both my children and have never had any problems with this product. However recently I have found that the nappies have started leaking causing my daughter to wake in the night soaking wet. Even though the nappy is not very full. And the same is happening during the day. My daughter who is almost 2 and not even 8kg (very petite ) is in size 3 super fit nappies which fit her so I know it s not the size. I am going to purchase some Asda nappies 2moro in the hope that I don t have to get up at 4am to a wet toddler that need s changing. I m sorry tesco but I feel let down now as I have relied on this product for so long and now i have to look else where which also mean going out of my way to a further shop.

I was really disgusted when  while preparing tonight s meals  I cut in to 3 of 4 potatoes I had bought (through online click and collect on Saturday evening  so not picked out by myself) to find this... Yuck! My 1 year old daughter was  helping  me by putting all the peeled skins in a bowl  and in true toddler style was investigating by putting things in her mouth. I m only glad that I spotted this before she sampled them too. One bad potato in a bunch would be understandable  but when it s 75% it suggests a bad product overall. Something that I would not expect from Tesco. ☹️	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13043314_10100782048548102_7519757593222404835_n.jpg?oh=de58fd9d0cf77afa0df483f7a9a35f41&oe=591D779F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13043314_10100782048548102_7519757593222404835_n.jpg?oh=e7d5b15fbfb743407fd5e7b5f72a20e0&oe=59109D92	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100782048548102&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-25T15:27:17+0000	1461598037	2016-04-25 17:27:17	4	4	4	0	8	4	2	2	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

A lot of families struggle to get by just buying their food shopping so the fact that they come to you knowing at the end of the year they will get a little something as a reward is a real help. Now you re trying to make things fair for everyone by taking away the small things that really made a difference to people s attitudes on where they shop and also how different their christmas can be. You re no better than politicians give to the rich and take from the Poor. We save our points every year to be able to provide a great christmas  and this year we have a newborn baby that we were hoping to use our points doubled up to take financial pressure of us. Seems you ve just added a lot more and provided us the difficulty of even a basic christmas.  Thank you Tesco.

Of course it is. Silly me thinking you were only interested in your profits. We re a growing family of 5. Last year we spent around  £8000 in Tesco on fuel and food  and the club card boost at Christmas helped us to get our kids a few extra bits they wanted. Now  you ve stopped the fuel scheme   and the club card boost  so we feel we have no reason to shop with you. There is zero incentive to stay with Tesco above the cheaper supermarkets.  I m off to Lidl which is closer and cheaper!					2016-04-25T13:45:38+0000	1461591938	2016-04-25 15:45:38	15	21	15	0	36	20	8	12	10	0	15	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the last 2yrs they have gradually dwindled.  No longer giving customers money off big shops. No fuel incentives. I ve not had any coupons for several months ( which is not a post issue as they would normally be available online also). Increased delivery costs and minimum spend.  Now you re informing us that you re getting rid of clubcard boost.  So now you re not giving customers ANY incentives for shopping with you then I may as well spend my thousands elsewhere. My hubby was making sure he filled up his work vehicle to save up the points. He drives a good thousand miles a week!   I can see from all the other posts that it s not just me that will no longer be loyal to Tesco. I may as well just go to Aldi like everyone else!   If you were losing profits before  driving loyal customers away is definitely not going to help I m afraid.					2016-04-25T13:20:18+0000	1461590418	2016-04-25 15:20:18	6	2	6	0	8	2	1	1	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was feeding 20 people throughout the weekend so was very busy and needed to use most of what l purchased. My parents have been shareholders in Tesco for the last 50+ years. I have not shopped at the large store for a few years as l did not have a car. Well  all I can say is that l will not be rushing back and l will certainly be avoiding your fresh fruit and veg.  I have attached 3 photos. Potatoes absolutely rotten and parsley that was rotten in the middle. Could you please ensure this goes to head office and l expect a reply  I also had an issue with your bags of frozen spinach.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13043283_10156878330565512_168736543550811538_n.jpg?oh=28b4f17f7774817a66138f6510c7862f&oe=58D76E0A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13043283_10156878330565512_168736543550811538_n.jpg?oh=8f8a765d8572e8d6d67f18af3397173b&oe=5909E91F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156878330565512&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-25T11:16:42+0000	1461583002	2016-04-25 13:16:42	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

He then went off to check for any and came back and said there weren t but then he went out back to find me a box...I hope he didn t get into trouble as I was walking away another lady said she wanted some as well as some had been reserved by the staff.					2016-04-25T10:40:58+0000	1461580858	2016-04-25 12:40:58	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a bag of four jacket potatoes delivers last week. Two were of reasonable jacket size  one a bit smaller than I would think of for a jacket. The fourth I had to laugh at as it wasn t much bigger than the  best by  label. The packaging says   selected....for size   I think something has gone wrong somewhere.					2016-04-25T10:03:52+0000	1461578632	2016-04-25 12:03:52	1	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

It s so great you are accepting these  now sainsburys have given up on cheaper prices! There seems to be some confusion at store level about the period during which you ll accept these vouchers. The press statements I ve read say until 30th June  but when I asked in store I was shown a memo sent from head office saying that it ends on 31st May. I m going overseas for a few weeks so would like to know whats the correct end date please?  Thanks					2016-04-25T09:53:42+0000	1461578022	2016-04-25 11:53:42	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I signed up to be a Christmas boost saver so I wasn t expecting this. If this is the case  then all of your customers that have already signed up for the Christmas saver  should be allowed to save until Nov.					2016-04-25T09:50:35+0000	1461577835	2016-04-25 11:50:35	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Like many  we signed up for the Christmas Savings  with the view to double up our points to help with the cost of Christmas shopping. Now you tell us we won t be able to do that. What was the point in signing people up for this year s scheme?! We were relying on the Boost for our Christmas shopping. If you felt the need to end the scheme  you should have at least honoured those of us on the current savings scheme & ended it after the November Boost. You re going to have a lot of upset customers.

Looking at the big frugal pages seems a lot of ppl shop this way as well! I think u will be losing a lot of loyal customers to cheaper competition!  Would probably been a good idea to survey regular customers to see if they wanted to lose this in flavour of your double up events!  But thanks u did me a flavour really I m gonna save a bunch going elsewhere! 👍🏻					2016-04-25T09:07:37+0000	1461575257	2016-04-25 11:07:37	2	8	2	0	10	8	4	4	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a Christmas saver for the last 3 or 4 years it has been a big help to use as pensioners to buy things we normally wouldn t such as a tumble dryer. l wish you had at least waited until the October statement to do this or just do it at Christmas. . l was on course to save the full amount again this year  but not sure whether to cash in or carry on.					2016-04-25T08:28:30+0000	1461572910	2016-04-25 10:28:30	5	9	5	0	14	9	2	7	3	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

She s just 37 and is a wonderful mother & friend to all that know her. Unfortunately Annette was diagnosed with Cancer in 2014 & has been out of work battling this terrible disease with the hope of returning to work when she was well enough to do so.This was a real possibility for her until she recently received the devastating blow that her cancer is now secondary and is now battling again to try and beat this. The offer of redundancy has come up and Annette decided to take it only to be told the other day that she is not entitled to it as she is out sick. Tesco s should hang their heads in shame for doing this  to this young mother who at the moment is going through hell both emotionally and physically. Please Share her story.

Let me set the scene-  there was a child of no older than 10 who had been sent into store with a rather large shopping list  he d collected the items and was at the self checkout. He paid for his items and began to bag them. The women behind the desk who I failed to collect the name of kept giving him really stern looks. She then confronted him and said you haven t paid for those bags in a harsh manner. The CHILD started to panic and claimed he had to which her response was  well it s not on your receipt  so you haven t . So the child simple says  I thought I did but I ll pay again . By this point he has got himself into a bit of a flap and I can only imagine is panicking and starting to feel embarrassed as the queue is starting to grow. To which at this point the lady behind me said  is this really necessary ... And to be honest she had a point. Could the women not have just let it go for once. The lady kept on at him whilst he tried to rectify the mistake so I stepped in and said  don t worry poppet I ll pay for your bags with my shopping  you go . To which he very politely looked at me in shock and said  thank you very much .  Your employee then commented that  you shouldn t be doing that  you have no idea how many people don t pay for bags  I m only doing my job . This was said in quite an agressive/defensive tone. I appreciate she was only doing her job but as I pointed out  he was an innocent child . I did not like how she told me what I shouldn t be doing  at the end of the day it s my money and my right to spend it as I will and as a decent citizen I am aware of the choice I made in that moment. I believe this women should have taken the time to go over to him  look at the receipt with him and discuss it. He in no way showed aggression or was rude so he attitude was unnecessary  and quite frankly I d be proud to be the parent of such a well mannered child who is willing to correct his innocent mistake. I know you have to charge for bags but honestly he was a CHILD - what has this world come to for people to get aggressive over a carrier bag? It was only 10p - is your company not making profit targets that she had to be so pedantic over such a little amount. I believe and so did the women behind me that this was a genuine mistake on the child s behalf and did not need to be dealt with the way it had.  I trust you will take steps to talk to the store about this employee and look forward to your reply.

As I was queueing at the self service checkouts I heard a woman in front of me in the queue saying that the staff member on duty at the self service check out had been shouting at an elderly man. I was thinking perhaps she misheard but then I witnessed the staff member shouting at this man simply because he was unable to work the machine. She kept shouting at him saying  I just told you how to do it and you did not listen  and  you ve paid for that twice now for god sake   Now I myself work in a retail environment and I would like to think tesco do not condone this behaviour amongst their staff. When I had finished paying for my shopping  the man had finished also and was talking to another woman who was as shocked as I was by the staff members behaviour. The man was shaking and when I asked him if he was ok he looked at me with tears in his eyes.  This is totally unacceptable. This woman needs taken in hand  she spoke to a harmless old man with such disrespect.  Others heard her and I hope they also contact you about this matter. I hope this will be looked into  Thank you					2016-04-24T22:07:34+0000	1461535654	2016-04-25 00:07:34	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was very much appreciated  and brilliant customer service!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13095944_10209139383180838_5770510778605130232_n.jpg?oh=03446517ae9748a78b5443f4b8cf2b2b&oe=59099EDB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13095944_10209139383180838_5770510778605130232_n.jpg?oh=6838de3aa159cd8db2972b6c6f2b1c0b&oe=5913DBD6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209139383180838&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-24T19:37:58+0000	1461526678	2016-04-24 21:37:58	24	8	24	0	32	8	6	2	9	0	24	0	0	0	0	0	0

This new style of packaging where you are now labeling foreign produce as  Redmere farms  or others is misleading and completely unnecessary and slightly abhorrent  When i shop online i am finding a lot of the items i want to buy are out of stock or unavailable. Meaning if i need the item in my delivery i have to get a more expensive item  pack sizes seem to get ever smaller on offer products as well  A major problem i recently had in your Cowley superstore was that i wanted some cooked chicken that was not reformed and was British for a reasonable price (lets say £3 for 200g)  could not find this at all  went down the road to Lidl however and they had 200g of British non reformed chicken for £1.99 and it tasted great  The quality of the cooked chicken i have had from Tesco recently has not been good at all  To me i look at the recent Financial constraints Tesco has been under and i wonder if the boardroom solution they have come up with to it is to try and sell substandard and poor quality goods at premium rates and therefore increase the profit margins for Tesco  I personally am not sure consumers will be fooled   Your disappointed consumer   OHJ					2016-04-24T17:55:47+0000	1461520547	2016-04-24 19:55:47	2	6	2	1	9	6	4	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have always been able to get liquid soap flakes from ur local store  and according to the groceries list on your site you even make your own version. However we were told at Wolverton that they don t sell this anymore. I am hoping this is a mistake as lots of people with skin conditions would use this instead of washing powder or liquid. It s also the only thing you should wash waterproof costs in. Could you please confirm this is no longer being stocked?					2016-04-24T16:01:14+0000	1461513674	2016-04-24 18:01:14	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I usually take my 12 week old son with me and I place him in one of your marvellous trollies designed to carry a car seat which makes my life a lot easier .   However  the peoples of Tescos Roneo Corner decide to park those trollies about 50 000 miles away from the store entrance and parent and baby spaces. This is quite an inconvenience to myself as my boy is a chunk and is rather heavy  gaining at least 2lbs on each shopping trip. Carrying him plus my 45kg changing bag full of supplies (30 nappies   6 spare outfits   ten thousand creams   45 made up bottles of milk - just in case - you never know!! ) it s a task to reach this said trolley without almost collapsing from exhaustion .   So please I would completely appreciate it if you could arrange for the parent and baby trollies to be parked just a bit closer to the parent and baby spaces   I and my arms would be eternally greatful. (I do want to be fit but I would like to avoid looking like popeye )   Thanks !!   🍏🍎🍐🍊🍆					2016-04-24T15:55:35+0000	1461513335	2016-04-24 17:55:35	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

For over a year now the pet food donation box has been information free  all the time while customers keep refilling the box to the top  assuming they re donation is going to a local charity.  I have been in correspondence with the Tesco customer care team for weeks now  asking where the donations are going  the answer they gave was a charity that doesn t even exist! This immediately raised suspicions.  After informing them that the charity doesn t exist  the manager decided to remove the box all together  instead of simply stating the donations recipient. More suspicious behaviour.  There is still no answer as to where all the customers donations have been going. And now the manager is  away .  So where have our donations been going? Back to Tesco shelves?! To the staff?!!  Please don t donate unless there is information on the boxes.  Feel free to share  and question why this is multi billion pound company cant answer where all their customers donations are going.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13082509_10156837440815015_8966420938336224219_n.jpg?oh=6c1d8adafa3d81b45d9a80a704d7c4b0&oe=590BE918	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13082509_10156837440815015_8966420938336224219_n.jpg?oh=a5e85ed16544cbaeba0a4445615171b5&oe=59240B15	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156837440815015&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-24T15:23:20+0000	1461511400	2016-04-24 17:23:20	4	4	4	2	10	2	2	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Filled our car up before heading back Upto Scotland. My sister went in and paid and came back out. As we were sitting waiting on a friend coming out  one of your members of staff came out with 2 Scottish £20 notes that my sister had handed over and proceeded to tell us that they can t be accepted as they are  old notes  even although they had already been through the till and change handed over to my sister. We told her that it was sterling and legal tender and the reply we got was we don t accept Scottish money. Personally I think this is ridiculous and disgusting behaviour and was totally uncalled for! As someone who travels regularly from Scotland down to England this is the first I ve experienced this at one of your branches. If tesco do not accept Scottish notes maybe there should be notices up to prevent further embarrassment!					2016-04-24T14:57:54+0000	1461509874	2016-04-24 16:57:54	2	21	2	1	24	20	6	14	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This lady I think suffers with some sort of mental and learning difficulties. She was very upset and shouting. The lady at customer services called sue really showed the woman comfort and support and mostly compassion and helped calmed the lady down. She took the time to talk to this woman while everyone else was staring. The lady said she had no family to turned to and I heard sue say you can always turn to us (tesco) This woman at your superstore is remarkable she didn t have to spend the time with the distressed lady but she did with a kind loving heart. I just want to thank you for hiring a remarkable woman  I worked with people with mental and physical disabilities and not many people cared for those like sue did today with that lady. This visit to your store just for a little shopping left me feeling happy and it filled my heart knowing there is still kind people out in the world today!					2016-04-24T14:33:04+0000	1461508384	2016-04-24 16:33:04	6	0	7	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	0

They appear to be a lot less absorbent since you ve changed the design of the waistband and sticky tabs  so much so that after a couple of hours they are hanging off my son. It doesn t help that the sticky tabs are now so long you can t stick them to the nappy  but have to overlap them. They also seem to be a bit narrower around the bottom  giving my son a  wedgie .

I own a HUDL 2  which has recently started developing charging problems.  I put it on charge overnight and it struggles to charge up.   This morning it only reached 75% charge  after being left overnight.  I charged it yesterday  but it struggled to reach double figures on the battery status. When I disconnect it  I get less than an hour s use from it  before it drops to 15%; then quickly goes flat.   It s not rooted or nodded in any way.					2016-04-24T13:05:21+0000	1461503121	2016-04-24 15:05:21	0	8	0	0	8	8	2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There was not a single decoration  banner  flag or poster for St. George s Day. Didnt see anything special for sale either. Now  on St. Patricks  you couldnt move for  green  stuff. Not a thing for St. George. Disgraceful. Please  explain yourselves  Tesco........					2016-04-24T12:54:18+0000	1461502458	2016-04-24 14:54:18	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

A couple of months ago my 2 year old decided to open a yogurt to eat  a member of staff handed me a spoon and a couple of wet wipes. Last week I saw big Star Wars cardboard figures and enquired about them as I have a 4 year old who s loves Star Wars  today when shopping a lovely lady remembered me and said they were already taken but gave me a Star Wars book. Amazing customer service thank you 😀					2016-04-24T12:49:55+0000	1461502195	2016-04-24 14:49:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only today to realise they must of stolen £50 from my centre arm rest pocket. Obviously I can not prove this.. But those bein the only people who had access to my car unattended. The money was put in there like it is every Friday ready for my daughters school lunch & snack money ready for Monday morning. Iv been trying to contact your head office & speak to a manager hoping that it s camered there  but iv little hope!!! This was the first time iv ever used this service costing me £20. I feel totally gutted! Like it says above I  cannot  prove this! But it s not rocket science is it.

Yesterday afternoon my husband bought a 2 pint carton of whole milk from your Abergavenny store. This is for my daughter who was 9 months old on Friday. I opened it this morning  and while pouring it into my babys cereal I noticed something black fall off the carton and landed a few cms away from the edge of the bowl. Apon closer inspection (and I touched it) I found it to be a MOUSE DROPPING. I have uploaded a better picture in the comments. Had this gone into my babys cereal without me noticing this could have had a much worse outcome. I am absolutely appalled and now question everything we have bought from that store over the last few years. I would like confirmation that mice are not contaminating food in the storage area of that store please and hope to hear back soon about this.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13000127_10156883667780192_3361155760200081357_n.jpg?oh=79f95a75009013417f95cc512ccbc424&oe=58D6BED1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13000127_10156883667780192_3361155760200081357_n.jpg?oh=d15243760ada2082c1d7569bd3a2dc46&oe=59155EDC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156883667780192&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-24T11:46:30+0000	1461498390	2016-04-24 13:46:30	1	6	1	0	7	6	4	2	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only bought a couple of items so I used the basket checkout. To say the woman serving behind the counter was rude would be an understatement. Walking towards the counter she was giving my son and I dirty looks. I was perfectly polite to her but she didn t speak and repeatedly gave my son very dirty looks  like he had just spat on the ground in front of her. Not a happy bunny with the attitude of this particular person. As I Left I could hear her being polite to the next customer. Unfortunately I didn t get her name and there s no name on the receipt.					2016-04-24T10:00:33+0000	1461492033	2016-04-24 12:00:33	0	7	1	0	8	7	5	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I just want to comment here that the price that shown between these 2 racks (different are the colors) is misleading the customers. After I purchased and only found out that the price is Rm42.45 for the black color instead of Rm33.90 because these 2 products are putting together but with ONLY ONE price tag shown on the display rack. These 2 products are very similar and only the color is different. You should have put the correct price tag and every product should have display the price tag so that your customers know the correct price especially the 2 products are similar with only color differences. Please improve this and I hope this won t happen again in the future. Thank you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13092034_10154093568065979_703212758193775262_n.jpg?oh=174871c05dd374baa63ad31c0d86fb73&oe=5908004F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13092034_10154093568065979_703212758193775262_n.jpg?oh=47e89245daf1749ae3cca6368a144d74&oe=59140F5A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154093568065979&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-24T09:58:28+0000	1461491908	2016-04-24 11:58:28	3	4	3	0	7	4	3	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Basiclly if u buy from tesco they mark up the price the day of delivry with no way to change your order at all!!! i should be able to say  oh well take off the massive pork joint that costs £10 or something  but no  its pretty much tough luck! so yes it is now cancelled yet again for the third time this month  was it not bad enough that the christmas shop i ordered came to over £15 extra on the day becasue of  weighted products  i.e. loose potatoes. There are never any promtional vouchers  and to build up club card points i have shopped with you for absolute years and yet have only 500 odd  i am so dissapointed with your corporation in gerneral  you feel like a cold american company just to take peoples money.  Asda do not do this  Asda charge what it says on the screen  Asda allow you to order your shopping for whenever as long as there is 2p in ur account  Asda refund your products there at your door and dont make you take them 10miles to folkstone or something! so tell me what is the benefit of your company exactly?					2016-04-24T09:21:58+0000	1461489718	2016-04-24 11:21:58	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This week i decided to try tescos for the items i can t get in Aldi and wow what a mistake that was. I spent at least £10 more in tescos than i would in sainburys. I was barged past by not one but 3 members of staff 2 doing tesco.com shopping and another in the veg isle. And the tills as normal queued with at least 3 people waiting. Tescos are losing money and customers hand over fist and they seem to be doing nothing about it. Back to sainsburys  aldi s and the butchers next week. Thank you tescos for reminding me why i stopped shopping with you.					2016-04-23T22:37:49+0000	1461451069	2016-04-24 00:37:49	1	3	1	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 3 year old was desperate for the toilet  he was jumping around trying to hold it in and was starting to panic. My husband asked a staff member if he could kindly accompany himself and our son to the toilet  and it was a downright  No it is impossible . My husband asked again  another downright  No. We ended up having to take him out onto the main road to do what he needed to do and noticed he had soiled himself as a result. I really hope this embarassment never happens to your children.					2016-04-23T21:24:23+0000	1461446663	2016-04-23 23:24:23	0	30	3	0	33	28	4	24	37	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0

I ordered omelette and chips. After 40mins wait and asking about my order it finally came and the omelette was rock hard. I took it back and it was replaced 10mins later with fewer chips than I had to start with. Other people were also waiting a long time for their meal. Very disappointed in the service and didnt receive an apology! Safe to say  I won t be eating there again					2016-04-23T20:00:06+0000	1461441606	2016-04-23 22:00:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I know that it s not Friday but following last nights excitement I thought I d go for chicken again. In addition to my bag of poultry I ve also bought a Cumberland sausage  a rack of ribs and a bag of doughnuts. I also purchased a bottle of chilli sauce but I m not sure I ll like it.  Why did you buy it?  I hear you ask. Well  Tesco there s a good reason  and we ll get to that shortly. Kayleigh from Customer Services was going to pop round and share the two extra pieces of chicken that I scored last night  only she never turned up. I wasn t concerned  it was Friday  she was probably working late. I ate all the chicken; all 34 pieces.  So here we are tonight. I bought a bag of Southern Fried chicken wings in the hope that Kayleigh might pop round  assuming she was busy last night and was going to come round tonight instead. I bought the chilli sauce in case she doesn t think I m  hot stuff  (clever aren t I!)  plus doughnuts for dessert. There s even four cans of Carling in the fridge  plus the Cumberland sausage and rack of ribs. As you may have guessed by now  there is no sign of Kayleigh.  You d managed to redeem yourself after the Great Cheese Fiasco  and now here we are back at square one  and I find myself alone with just chicken  ribs  sausage  doughnuts  and a bottle of chilli sauce (that I may or may not like) for company.  I won t lie Tesco  you ve broken my heart 💔	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13012637_10156748762025459_29339060644422879_n.jpg?oh=ed0cb74d5c3f5361e4b9b84a31448f72&oe=59220C42	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13012637_10156748762025459_29339060644422879_n.jpg?oh=b6126bf1764be5cd83ff8d2b81052c9e&oe=59066A83	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156748762025459&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-23T18:52:14+0000	1461437534	2016-04-23 20:52:14	71	22	88	8	118	22	8	14	94	0	70	5	0	12	0	0	0

My husband works at your head office and our little boy was 2lb 5oz born almost 4 years ago and clothing was a nightmare to buy for him. If it wasn t for the care of the neonatal unit at Birmingham women s hospital it would probably have been a very different outcome and story. If I could have afforded it I would have purchased the entire rack and donated them...

I doubt I will see anything done differently though. it seems there is never a trip where I DON T see children allowed to sit inside the trollies.   does tesco ever intend to enforce this rule? if not  why even bother having the sign on the handle that this is not allowed.					2016-04-23T16:29:30+0000	1461428970	2016-04-23 18:29:30	4	8	5	0	13	8	1	7	0	0	3	0	0	0	1	0	0

I went in to buy two loaves of bread and some bananas. Stood in the queue for nearly ten minutes waiting to be served by the single checkout operator who was also tasked to sell scratch card lottery tickets as well as serving people buying groceries. I have no desire to use the self service terminals in this store as they are always going out of order.  In the end I left the queue and  like so many others who use this store - or rather try to  I dumped the basket  on the one of the many unmanned service areas and walked out and went else where for what i needed.  This is par for the course for this store and has been since the day the opened. The only alteration is that this store gets worse and worse with each passing month.  It s disgraceful the way this store is run and managed. Queues are allowed to back up right up to the far end of the store up to the freezer units creating not only a health and safety hazard but customer s stepping on each other s feet and bumping into each other trying to get past. And it doesn t matter how many times people  in the queue for another checkout to be opened - it goes ignored - and is quite infuriating when there is one person behind the counter serving and another person behind the counter solely just to feed all the takings from the self service machine into a coin counter - ignoring the ever expanding queue of people waiting to be served. It s even more infuriating when  on the vary rare occasion  that there are two people serving that one has to spend most of that time hovering about the self service terminals section   correcting  all the technical issues and malfunctions which seem to constantly plague these  self service  machines. And as for the hygiene standard - this store is filthy. The crud and filth that has accumulated on the checkout counters is disgusting. And the state of the ice cream cabinet in the corner of the isle is chocking - pure filth. An issue I will be bringing to the attention of the Environment Dept with the local authority.					2016-04-23T14:12:17+0000	1461420737	2016-04-23 16:12:17	0	11	0	0	11	11	2	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Asked where I could find the kosher food and got an aggressive NO back and when I questioned that was given such an abrupt answer by a member of staff he got his three staff members to jump to his defence and they all lashed out at me. Spoke to the duty manager  Simon  but wasn t reassured much would be done. This was a blatant anti-Semitic rant. If I asked where the Asian food was I would of got a polite answer maybe. Feel disgusted. Question if I will ever go back.					2016-04-23T13:39:37+0000	1461418777	2016-04-23 15:39:37	0	7	0	0	7	7	4	3	15	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My husband found this foreign body  a piece of plastic in a Tesco frozen pie on the 10th January. I contacted customer services and sent the plastic in as requested and was told to await a response.  Months have now passed and I have still not received any form of explanation just a refund for the product. This is completely unacceptable. Do you not have any process in place for these issues?  I await your response without further delay.

Her two wishes were to marry her long term boyfriend and then to go home to die.   I believe the Marie Curie nurses contacted your Lincoln Tesco store (she was in the Lincoln County Hospital so I am presuming it was the closest one to it) to tell them of the situation and they had a wedding to organise    Tesco then took over and they organised an amazing buffet including bucks fizz  flowers  sandwiches  snacks  rolls  cakes and the most beautiful part was the personalised wedding cake  which had obviously had been hand written with beautiful icing flowers that were also hand made. This was then sent across to the hospital all within a few hours of hearing about the wedding taking place  and only 8 hours after she received the life shattering news  and all of this was done free of charge!   During the course of that awful day and night I can not tell you how much it made our family smile and praise Tesco for their kindness and the effort that went in. Nothing is going to cure my beautiful cousin  but in the face of such darkness  a company the size of Tesco stepped above and beyond and showed how much they cared  this one act will stay with me and my family for ever and I would be pleased if you could pass our thanks and appreciation to your wonderful team  you should be proud to have them in your team  I am certainly proud to tell this story  as the general public are very quick to criticise when a business gets it wrong but not quick enough to praise them when they get it right.					2016-04-23T10:58:05+0000	1461409085	2016-04-23 12:58:05	23146	909	25221	3620	29750	904	868	36	378	0	22895	1565	46	4	433	0	0

I shop with you every week on line and have my order delivered. Two doors down also do the same thing. In fact most weeks we both book the 8-9 slot on a Saturday. However our deliveries come on different vans normally at The same time or within a few minutes of each other. Surely it would be more cost effective to send the same van to the same road at the same time. Also better for the environment if deliveries for the same area are grouped together?					2016-04-23T07:43:46+0000	1461397426	2016-04-23 09:43:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went into the nailsworth  Gloucestershire store at 10:58pm this evening. I went to get some tissue and some ketchup I was rudely and abruptly told to hurry up by a grey haired man with glasses who I believe may have been the manager but not 100% he also told me when asked that he didn t have either of the 2 things I was looking for and soon realised he was lying when I had a look myself! He basically followed me around the store shooing me out like I was some animal! I politely said a bit of patience wouldn t hurt! And he rudely made some sarcastic remark!					2016-04-22T22:13:28+0000	1461363208	2016-04-23 00:13:28	1	9	1	0	10	8	4	4	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well done tesco 👏👏 you manage to outdo ur self everytime. Who has heard of not having a substitute for ham or gammon even if it was value stuff would of been better than nothing  and that s not to mention the fact that for the 2nd week running I put two packs of ham and u still manage to get the amount as only 1 pack that u didn t even have a substitute for. Add on top of this the other 5 items that we did not receive and I think you can appreciate why I am feeling rather p***** off. Especially because the reason I have it delivered in the first place is because I can t physically go to ur store as awaiting surgery on my shoulder meaning I can t carry bags of shopping as I can t take the weight!					2016-04-22T20:54:00+0000	1461358440	2016-04-22 22:54:00	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They then called to let us know it would definitely be a while and told us what happened to the guy and that other driver would bring our order.  Then gave us a bottle of fancy white wine because our order was late. Such nice guys! P.s. the delivery guy is ok.

I ve just purchased this garlic pizza bread from your Ashby De La Zouch store for £1 of my hard earned money  and I ve been left feeling let down and bemused. The description on the box claims that this will be CHEESY and as you can see from the pictures  it leaves a lot to be desired.   I m somewhat feeling like a 16 year old Kim Kardashian fan who idolises the woman  similar to my feelings towards cheesy garlic bread  and seeing a photo of her before the photoshops worked its magic.   I look forward to hearing your reply.   Yours sincerely    A very unsatisfied garlic bread lover.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13043744_10154159595099532_7054316470383488488_n.jpg?oh=c53cabf0f49fca58cf3a47ba1ae4e95d&oe=58D78932	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13043744_10154159595099532_7054316470383488488_n.jpg?oh=6fce0ad592dcb6459b1761e334fc825b&oe=5917823F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154159595099532&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-22T18:23:47+0000	1461349427	2016-04-22 20:23:47	156	25	178	12	215	22	21	1	59	0	152	2	1	17	1	0	0

My wife took my twins (5 years old) in for a treat. My boy decided on a Cadburys chocolate log  only to be told at the till that he couldn t have it because  it was not on file  a bit abruptly! Obviously he was heartbroken  (little things matter a lot at 5 years old) I returned to the store where the item had been quickly removed from the shelf. I asked at  customer services  and was very quickly passed to the store manager  who apologised and gave (free of charge) the muchly desired chocolate log. Thus ending my boys sobbing!  So  bad point....... Abrupt staff who didn t care less about a boys feelings.  Good point... A very nice  competent manager who solved the problem in seconds.  Ps I had already bought a different chocolate log  so my boy now has 2! More exercise needed tomorrow! (Probably for me as well.)					2016-04-22T18:15:22+0000	1461348922	2016-04-22 20:15:22	2	16	3	0	19	16	5	11	6	0	2	0	0	0	0	1	0

He s the friendliest guy I ve met.  Also  I ve turned up there past few weeks with my Mam on crutches after a leg-reconstruction  and he s saw us pulling up in the disabled bay; he treats her and other disabled customers like VIPs  bringing the trolley and helping her with her crutches.  Proper awesome way to start the night off  a massive smile  and banter  and good vibes off someone like that makes a massive difference.  Got his name tonight  Victor.... give him a raise or just a pat on the back and tell him he s doing an awesome job.					2016-04-22T17:38:56+0000	1461346736	2016-04-22 19:38:56	573	62	590	29	681	60	39	21	81	0	565	17	0	0	0	0	0

Afterwards my Mum needed to visit our local Tesco Extra Cumbernauld but the thought of this filled me with dread but I pulled up my big girl pants and with my stubbornness took my sticks and attempted the walk from the carpark to the store. We were greeted by a gentleman whom was working at the security desk just before I admitted defeat  I believe his name was Thomas. Being only 28 having to use one of the buggies is soul destroying this gentleman went above and beyond his duty and also furthermore helped us to the car. This gentleman is an asset to your company and deserves a big pat on the back. For once thanks to Thomas  being in a supermarket wasn t as bad as usual!

My gut.  I have since taken steps to rethink my eating and discovered most of it was habitual.  This is the entrance to my local Highcliffe store  I never really thought about it before  and I guess that is because being surround by bright  shiny  enticing packets has been normalised.  Do you feel that retailers have a responsibility in the current obesity crisis and the impact that is having on our over stretched NHS ?

I recently purchased a 16 pack of AAA excelltec batteries against my better judgement and to say they are rubbish is an understatement  I have gone through 8 using my clippers in the space of shaving my moustache which isn t one of those fancy German looking ones or even the epic Gandalf style. So my question is who do I have to forcefeed these rubbish things to before they are  allowed to think they are a reputable supplier?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13012832_10153928361730189_5146471402650913065_n.jpg?oh=63f0ef8fcab979c3eb3e973d6e35ec00&oe=591B5D63	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13012832_10153928361730189_5146471402650913065_n.jpg?oh=0a789cc0740a4a9cbedb58c6c72e59ed&oe=59092B6E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153928361730189&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-22T13:02:18+0000	1461330138	2016-04-22 15:02:18	5	1	5	0	6	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

My nan and grandad have lived in Risca 15 years and was so excited tesco built an extra store 5 mins away from there house. My grandparents shopped at tesco every week. When my nan was ill at home last year some of the staff noticed they hadn t seen my grandparents for a few weeks so laura dropped round to see if they were okay. As nan got better she started shopping again. Sadly my nan passed away on the 3rd of April this year and again laura popped into my granddads house to see why she hadnt seen my nan for a while and obviously found out about my nan. A few days later Laura popped round with a card of condolence and said if my granddad needed anything to let her know. Unfortunately I do not know Lauras last name but laura goes to show tesco goes above and beyond.					2016-04-22T12:36:57+0000	1461328617	2016-04-22 14:36:57	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not wanting to walk round looking like a thief  i just took it up to my local Tesco along with the receipt to see if they could de-tag it or just refund it but they couldn t help. Without me having to trek back up to the big Tesco  is there anything that can be done or way to get it refunded?

It was meant to be delivered tomorrow  I have just had a call to say it s out of stock and won t be arriving??? I have had to re-paint a bedroom and move stuff around ready for the delivery. The mattress that I ordered couldn t be delivered on the same day-so was delivered an hour ago!? With a delivery window of 7-7  which is ridiculous! Most companies now give u a window of a 2/3 hour slot the day before  or at least am/pm. The lady who I spoke to  who I cannot fault her customer service skills  was unable to tell me when it will be back in stock! So I now have a mattress I don t need and a very upset four year old wanting his big boy bed!!! I am really disappointed with the service I ve received.					2016-04-22T12:12:42+0000	1461327162	2016-04-22 14:12:42	0	8	0	0	8	8	1	7	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The response?  Clubcard vouchers are not able to work or be used against partner items. Only items sold by Tesco.  Maybe try not putting things on your  Tesco  website if that s the case as it s misleading! Maybe start thinking about your customers and their experience rather than your profit line!

I rang their Hudl Helpline  the first person I spoke to was aware of the issue and said he would call me back within 72 hours  which never happened.  Every person I have spoken to since the first conversation has been dismissive and suggest I use another £59 of my own money to fix a problem that is already known to Tesco  this has been going on for two months and now I am really at my wits end.  How can this be fair when I spend so much with one retailer who does not care.   I think I will be contacting Trading Standards and the press.

I often choose to purchase your own brand goods and usually find them excellent value for money and of great quality.   On Thursday 21st of April 2016 I found myself with a spare hour before the school run and needed a few essentials to see me through until my regular  click and collect  slot on Monday  so of course I popped into my local friendly Tesco superstore on Wragby road  Lincoln. I have to admit that perusing your aisles with a self scanner and trolley alone is one of my guilty pleasures.   As I was scanning the feminine hygiene products aisle  imagine my delight and pure excitement when I notice a pack of ten  press on towels  for just 15p - yes you read that correctly  you sell 10 press on towels for 15p!!!! That s 0.02p per towel. Now don t get me started on the issue around paying tax on sanitary products as they are classed as a luxury item by the government! So  being the wonderful company that you are I was almost jumping for joy down the aisles upon my 0.02p per towel discovery. I resisted stockpiling all of the packets off the shelf  and decided to just buy two packets as a trial.   I shall not add too much detail now but this morning I used your 0.02p item for the first time. All was going well..... Until I was in the doctors waiting room with my daughter  upon walking to the dr s office I realised my 0.02p item was not performing to its intended purpose - it was currently making its way down my trouser leg. Once leaving the dr s  navigating my way through the busy waiting room I had a total malfunction of my 0.02p item - it had been on its travels all the way down my trouser leg and onto the floor - I had to swiftly retrieve said 0.02p item from the floor and whip it into my hand - not an experience I wish to repeat.  On my return to home  I had recovered from the ordeal. Before putting in a complaint  I researched the item  to ensure I had fully followed instructions and that it was not user error. Instructions were clear and simple  that I would expect from your wonderful company.  The said 0.02p item - also termed a  press on towel  was indeed used as instructed on the packet and  pressed into underwear . I would like to add that I also pondered the fact that maybe my underwear was unsuitable for the 0.02p item. Again  I will not go into delicate detail but my undergarments are not flimsy small items  they are made for comfort not style and fashion  although not quite into  Bridget Jones  territory they should support the application of a  press on towel . Now  as I purchased 2 packs of your 15p press on towels  I decided to look into what else I could have purchased instead of said 30p for the press on towels which did not remain  pressed on . I could have purchased 16 paracetamol for £0.25 - leaving me with 5p change and some welcome relief from the troublesome pains that accompany the need for  press on towels . I could have also purchased 100g of tesco value chocolate for 30p  which may not aid with pain relief or hygiene purposes but would provide much needed comfort and feel good factor for such times as  press on towels  are required. Upon delving deeper  I also could have purchased Tesco toilet paper for 0.08p per sheet and Tesco sticky tape for £0.25 and made my own  press on towels  - which may have provided longer  more secure protection than the 15p  press on towel  I purchased.  Now  I am not suggesting your  press on towels  are not fit for purpose or may infringe trading standards as they are not in fact very securely  press on  but maybe a name change? Could I suggest  very lightly press on towels  or maybe  press on but then migrate down your trouser leg towels ? Or possibly some additional information on the packaging such as a suggestion as to also using an additional item to secure  press on towel  in place? - you could add your Tesco sticky tape for £0.25 and place next to  press on towels  on shelf or even have a multi deal for buying the two? At the very minimum I would like to suggest a advisory note on the packaging  as a warning to other users about the migrating down the trouser leg possibility.  I would be pleased to hear your thoughts on my suggestions.

With numerous trays missing. The driver has told me that another delivery is going to be made  and that customer services are aware of this. The reason I picked and PAID for that delivery slot was because it was convenient for me. I did have plans today. But looks like I ll be waiting for my shopping! Very disappointing.   If customer services was aware  it would of been more appropriate for them to contact me regarding this matter  and give me a time for my new delivery. But no nothing. However I would like to add that you driver had exceptional customer service skills and has apologised and your be half.   So here I am waiting for my shopping  for how long who knows! One very unhappy customer.					2016-04-22T10:15:12+0000	1461320112	2016-04-22 12:15:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can only assume that Bakers are paying you to label this as such.   Tesco have a responsibility to their customers to correctly label their products on sale  and not to mislead.   If you actually took a few minutes to research the ingredients of Bakers  you would find the product to be the canine equivalent of Smarties.  This is well documented information within the dog world.   🐕🐕  Fido is hyper enough without his belly being filled with copious quantities of e numbers.   Perhaps the more nutritional dog food opposite would be more deserving of this  Advanced Nutrition  label.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/s130x130/13082030_10207373405505922_1473426028_n.jpg?oh=99cdc90081a93ba99a55a030102d59d0&oe=58800403	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/s720x720/13082030_10207373405505922_1473426028_n.jpg?oh=593750c5ee898161661bb4bd6336311a&oe=58802F9C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207373488587999&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-22T09:38:58+0000	1461317938	2016-04-22 11:38:58	8	21	10	2	33	20	6	14	21	0	8	0	0	0	0	1	0

These where provided over the counter without any prescription or consultation. Thought we were good to go until our friends also needs some and I said I can get some from you. Today arrived to ask for the same to be told they need a consultation/prescription  advised we had nothing previously and these where handed over by Tesco staff and she advised we did only need over the counter tablets and are a lot cheaper. Asked for a refund on the ones provided and was refused! I have my receipt and want my money back. I have been illegally given a controlled drug without a prescription and want this sorting and my money back!

Each time I place my weekly online order for Click and Collect for the next day  Tesco has been charging my bank account on average £4 more than what I would have received in an email confirmation. Dear Tesco customers  please compare your online order confirmation with the actual payment on the card and don’t allow Tesco to steal money from you!  I have just called the customer service to complain about the issue  and all I got is the explanation that the offers and discounts that are valid on the day of order might have gone on the day of delivery. We are talking one day difference here! On the top  Tesco must find a way how to highlight this difference to the customers. If Tesco can search Asda  Morrisons and co. for price comparison  they must have find a way to highlight this difference as well.  As a gesture of a “good will”  I got £10 e—voucher. However  if I calculate how much I pay more just for the last 5 months  the whooping amount that was taken from my account comes up to £60!!!  I feel so let down by Tesco brand and company all together...					2016-04-22T08:23:51+0000	1461313431	2016-04-22 10:23:51	1	24	1	4	29	24	3	21	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I took the chance and nipped round the store and as I got to the end my shopping my daughter woke up and was hysterical.  I went to checkout with my pram  screaming tot and my trolley full of shopping wondering how the hell I was going to check it out!   The lady on the till was an absolute diamond! As soon as she saw my predicament she said  feel free to give her a cuddle  Leaving me free to pick up my baby and not only cuddle but feed her as she scanned  packed and put all the shopping in the trolley for me. She was patient whilst I one handed let found my purse and paid. She was so kind and helpful it made my day!   I waited in the store for my husband to come and rescue me.  I am dreadfully sorry that I didn t get her name but she had dark hair and I can t thank her enough for helping a mama out and going above and beyond xxx					2016-04-22T06:59:55+0000	1461308395	2016-04-22 08:59:55	8	5	8	0	13	5	2	3	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

This just goes to show that the rude cashier Rukah has the full support of the manager Florence & she also has the complete support of Tesco. I am really disappointed  I guess the customer service rep I spoke to is also on the same contract that Rukah is on as the manager Florence told me  Tesco does not pay for any overtime  it does not matter if it s a minute .					2016-04-21T23:24:56+0000	1461281096	2016-04-22 01:24:56	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You book a delivery slot and get a text message to say it s going to be 30 mins late ..  Ok that s not really a problem.  Tesco van turns up and 2 drivers sit outside chatting.  You don t go out cause you just assume they are taking a break.  15 mins later they leave.  You call Tesco to ask what s going on to be told  the driver could t find your house  called and left a message.  Customer advised to rebook delivery.   Right  unless I m suddenly incapable of hearing my phone  seeing a missed call  noticing / getting a text to say you have a new message - the driver is spinning a yarn!  The guy on the end of a phone is called Taz and consistently uses the phrase  to be honest  which actually just infuriated me to boiling point can t help - had no way to contact the driver  does not listen to me I tell him that I can t understand why the driver couldn t find my house when he was sat outside it for 15 mins!  So Taz responds with I ll rearrange delivery for you for tomorrow and I won t charge you the £6.50 delivery.  Wow thanks!  Earliest delivery  they can offer me is 10am tomorrow - just perfect when you need things for 8.30am tomorrow..  Tesco you ve done yourself proud here with a very loyal customer.... And to top it all off when I suggested you might want to consider some vouchers for the shocking service - the response I get is  I m not charging you £6.50 delivery for tomorrow ....  Just marvellous!  Rant over!!!					2016-04-21T22:01:59+0000	1461276119	2016-04-22 00:01:59	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They looked perfectly fine to me. If they are in fact baked that day  they are still fresh  yes you can t sell them the next day  I understand that but surely they could go to a homeless charity rather than in the bin?!?

My mother stopped by for a quick food shop accompanied by my brother and while walking through one of the vegetable produce isles she slipped and fell.   Why? Because there was so much rubbish (various veggies and mess) on the floor that she skidded with her walking stick and landed hard on her one good knee and the arm that supported her. She is -- and has been -- disabled for many years after Polio left her right leg practically unusable even with a caliper.   This is the first time she has ever had a fall in that Tesco s store and as a family we ve been visiting it for as long as I can remember so it gives a little bit of an impression how standards appear to have dropped.   I understand you can have a bad day  you can be short-staffed  you can have all the excuses in the world to make a mistake  but when my mum sat there with a cup of tea being looked after by one of the lovely staff members (sorry I have no idea who it was but my mum said she was so attentive and caring  and really appreciated her help)  the manager however  was busy on the phone to the claims line covering their backside and trying to play the whole situation down like it s nothing.   When a disabled lady slips and falls in your store because of your manager s negligence of hygiene and maintenance  then running off the claims line is the last thing that manager should be doing.   I doubt my mum will do anything other than spend the next week or so struggling just a little bit more now her already weakening body has taken another hit. She s more forgiving than most. I won t ignore that she was given the groceries (a few ready meals  condiments  and veggies probably totaling less than £15) for free as a good will gesture too  which was nice because I know some some places wouldn t even bat an eyelid.   Hopefully this reads properly to those who see it  and the message gets across. Oh and if it gets deleted I ll be happy to post the backup copy across pretty much every social network possible.   To break it down  sort out the standards in your disgusting Thetford store and get a manager in there who actually gives a rats-a about their job and responsibilities.					2016-04-21T20:58:15+0000	1461272295	2016-04-21 22:58:15	3	3	4	0	7	3	1	2	2	0	3	0	0	0	1	0	0

I had to ask for a till to be opened which was then closed behind me. When I asked why I was told that if was because there were a large number of students from a local school and they didn t want to serve them and wanted to make sure they used the self service checkout. They may be students but they are still customers couldn t believe the attitude of the staff in there!					2016-04-21T18:41:08+0000	1461264068	2016-04-21 20:41:08	1	2	1	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A few hours ago  after just having our hair done (my 13 year old daughter who is on spectrum and has dyspraxia as well as other disabilities and I) we popped into tesco.  I have been really ill since last July with acute bacterial bronchopneumonia (had it back 7 or 8 times and have had countless steroids and penicillin) and it was a treat to have our hair done as I have only been out 5 or 6 times since July. Anyway  I parked in a mother and child bay thinking it was a disabled bay.  As we got out of the car the man parked in the bay beside me said  you aren t meant to park there  and words to the effect that I had to move. I asked him why & he said  it s for children!   He was really getting quite rude and obnoxious.  I said I would move but said to him there was no need to be rude. He said  my wife is the manager at Tesco and she will tell you . The wife said  your  parking is over there!  Said in the same tone as the husband quite abruptly.  The husband then went on to say  we aren t allowed to park in  your  bays  I said OK  went to get back in my car and the man said  anyway  what is your disability  being fat .  This is an utterly disgusting thing to say and in front of my daughter.  This comes at a time when the dispatches program  which was on the other night  exposed one of their assessors bragging that he got paid £20 000 a month to do assessments and all the other derogatory and inflamatory things that he said.  Genuine people that have disabilities are treated badly enough by the government  as it is  with the horrendous assessments we have to go through but you certainly do not want or indeed expect to have this type of abuse when you are just out and about minding your own business.  I was upset so I went to customer services in the Lowestoft Yarmouth store and a manager called Steve (that had been there since 2001) came to see me.  The lady on customer service practically had to almost beg him to come down and explained everything that had happened to him on the phone.  He said  what s the problem!   He said there wasn t much he could do because it s probably just a shopper!  Perhaps I could check CCTV but then I am not back in until tuesday etc  etc! This is how the conversation went until I asked my daughter  is it me or does he seem like he is not bothered about what had just happened? My daughter agreed and I then asked him why he didn t even want to take my name etc. In the end I just said don t bother and we walked out. I rang head office and first of all I was told that the child bay s are up to 5 years old as the bay s are for getting children out of the car safely. I said that I didn t know that but with a daughter on the autism spectrum (she is not road aware) and also falls so I have to hold her hand etc  then the bay s should also be for children like this. He went on to say that because it was a shopper saying what he said  there was nothing they could do! My daughter reminded me what the wife (the tesco manager) said and he then said that he would investigate!  I have been really upset all afternoon and so has my daughter and that is why I felt I had to post this.  Because the little weazle of a man wound his window up after he called me fat he might not have heard my reply so here it isn t!   One. You must be very proud of the example of a father  man and human being  that you are showing to your children. Two. I can lose weight but you are stuck with that face for the rest of your life! The way in which Tesco has handled this is utterly disgusting and the 2 poor excuses of human beings need to take a long hard look in the mirror and really think about what they did today in front of my 13 year old daughter. Please feel free to share this post and sorry it s so long. Thankyou (X-Tesco shopper)					2016-04-21T16:55:05+0000	1461257705	2016-04-21 18:55:05	1	36	1	0	37	32	10	22	44	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is increasingly frustrating to constantly not get the  Meal Deal  after paying. Today i tripled checked that all the products labels were yellow (and item matched description) and in the  Meal Deal  as i was in a rush i didn t check my receipt until i got home  yet again for the  deal  not to come off at the end off the transaction!! How hard is it to put all the  meal deal  in one area?? Or is this Tesco plan that it confuses people that much that they don t get the  deal  and Tesco reap the profit??

My rant exceeds that limit.   I have just been told by Indesit that the washing machine I was expecting today can t be delivered because the driver has a bad back... seconds after I saw him drive off.   While I ve always been satisfied with the level of customer service Tesco has continuously given me over the years I feel Indesit have totally let you down today.   Here is a copy of the email I have sent to Indesit customer services:  Dear Indesit  RE: Order number 49GXQQW6G-1  After placing an order for a washing machine (plus free recycling) through Tesco directly on the phone and stating very clearly that I live in a block of flats  I have just been told that it’s not possible to get it today as the driver has a bad back.   I saw the truck pull up outside. A guy knocked on my door and said “I thought it was one flight of stairs  I’ll have to go and speak to the driver”.   He went away and I watched the lorry drive off.   He then called me to say that  because it was 3 flights of stairs  they’d have to reschedule delivery.   I telephone your customer services only to be told that a traffic warden had moved them on.   My wife was standing on the balcony all the time the lorry was there. We have deliveries daily and never has a traffic warden moved on a delivery truck. That was the first blatant lie.   When I contested this I was then told that the delivery driver “may have been alone”  which wasn’t the case as the driver’s mate said to me that he was going to speak to the driver.  Then I was told that the delivery driver has hurt his back.  Did he hurt his back driving here? At what point did the guy who delivers washing machines for a living decide that his back was too poorly to deliver a washing machine today?  When he took one look at my stairs no doubt.  I now have to take more time off work on the hope that a guy with a good back can deliver it on Monday.  I’ve decommissioned my old washing machine so can’t even get a wash on until then.   Absolutely pathetic service.   Don’t even bother apologising  it means nothing.   Regards   John Squirrell.  While I fully appreciate this out of your control I think someone needs to have a very stern word with that lazy delivery driver who couldn t be bothered to get my order up a few flights of stairs.					2016-04-21T13:22:46+0000	1461244966	2016-04-21 15:22:46	0	11	1	0	12	11	3	8	7	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Wed my order appears but only 1kg instead of 5. Bear in mind this is an on offer item  the store called saying they had only 1kg delivered that day!!! I re order my delivery for today  1 hour ago i get a call saying that yet again the store only had 1.5 kg delivered on their delivery  they ordered 6 cases. So for 3 days now you cant supply an on offer item  its a con to get customers in store  when you dont really have the product. Sharp practice tesco and Dodgy dealing. Crikey all i am asking for is 5 kg of bloody cod loins! Fish historically is and was the country s national dish!! Please pass this on to the relevant person  or somone who knows JESUS CHRIST personally  I heard a rumour he could turn 3 small fishes into enough to feed the multitudes.  I shall now be looking for another supermarket to supply my order					2016-04-21T13:09:23+0000	1461244163	2016-04-21 15:09:23	0	4	0	0	4	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m gluten free and I only eat Schar rolls and was shocked to see as they are well within their use by date especially as they aren t cheap. I ve never have a problem with them before so i don t know if they have changed the well they are stored before they go on the shop floor or its a problem with the factory they were made but I decided not to eat any as didn t want to be ill and there appearance wasn t the same as usual either.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13043433_590081281160063_6965759215686765203_n.jpg?oh=6823680cecb7837ba7c9bb87b3813ab9&oe=58D73BCE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13043433_590081281160063_6965759215686765203_n.jpg?oh=f45f119e67b1111508169ad9fc1424f0&oe=590DDF31	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=590081281160063&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-21T08:29:37+0000	1461227377	2016-04-21 10:29:37	1	9	1	0	10	8	3	5	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Once again your site promotes a meal for £10 yet there is not a single desert available. This has been going on for many weeks on and off. Do you really have no deserts on-line or have you simply failed to rectify this despite having the issue flagged numerous times?

I was doing my shopping around 9.30pm when approaching the fresh bread and cakes area I noticed some jam doughnuts reduced from 50p to 33p (not a lot of saving) so I picked up 2 packets when turning around to continue my shopping two ladies from the store were throwing all the rest of the reduced Items in large orange recycling bags there was 4 full stacked on a cage I was disgusted that all that waste was being thrown there are so many people going hungry and the store is open till 12am so why not reduced to 10p put at the front of the store so the customers can buy them rather than throw good food away or even give it to food banks I know that you cant sell past their sell buy date but at least give customers a chance to use the food and the staff that goes in at 12 could get rid of the waste then I would have quite happily have given them £5 for the lot but as I can see Tesco s never give anything away even the reduced items only have a couple of pence off but as I m a mother of a large family would have happily bought the reduced goods given the chance because if we hadn t have got there when we did the doughnuts I bought would have ended up in the recycle bags with the rest of them.					2016-04-21T08:22:10+0000	1461226930	2016-04-21 10:22:10	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I tried it  didn t work  duly sent PM.  I messaged on here again on Tuesday to complain the my pm had still not been read and once again pointing out the items unwanted were sale items  still no response!!

I stopped shopping at Aldi for this reason and now it is happening at tesco- i bought some plumbs the other day  had a bite of one and it was black inside. I then cut up the others and only one of them was ok. I also went to tesco on Monday (just gone) and had to hand the woman who was putting out veg a few items that was completely over looked and covered in mould. It couldn t of been that hard to see as i spotted it straight away. Personally if tomatoes are covered in mould i think the full batch should be thrown out as it could of contaminated the others? She was greatful that I handed them back but didnt even go to check any of the other stock.					2016-04-21T06:20:54+0000	1461219654	2016-04-21 08:20:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I’ve tried contacting you via your website’s feedback form on Monday 17th April 2016 and unfortunately I have not received any feedback from your side be it from email or phone call. So  this is my next effort in getting in touch with you as I can’t get any solution from your Seremban 2 Store.  Below is the information I posted on your company’s website last Monday. I really seek your cooperation in settling this issue as soon as possible. Thank you. Hi and good day   I would like to bring your attention to a problem that I faced in Tesco Seremban 2 that have happened on two occasions: 20th Feb. 2016 and 21st Feb 2016. I have tried to settle this issue for almost 2 months with the store manager Muhammad Hafiz  but he has failed to help me resolve my problem.  20th Feb 2016: I shopped at your outlet and my total bill was RM522.95. I paid using debit card via current account. During the first attempt  the cashier claimed that the transaction was unsuccessful  and they tried it for the second time also claiming it was unsuccessful. For the third time  I asked the cashier to charge on to my saving account and the transaction was successful. Unfortunately  when I checked my bank statement  it was stated that 2 deductions amounting RM 522.95 per transaction were charged to my current accoount.  21st Feb 2016 I shopped again at your store and at 9.27am during payment  the same problem happened during my payment. The cashier claimed payment via current account from my debit card failed and then the card was swiped again for payment from saving account.  And again  when I checked my bank statement  there were two deductions for my purchase on the 21st. All this while  I contacted the store manager Mr Muhammad Hafiz and he has provided me email print outs regarding the conversation between S2 store and Jia Ying Lim. In one of the email  it stated that Tesco has already refunded on 23March. But  this is not true. I have not received any refund from your side. The total amount that should be refunded to me is RM1385.15. I have already contacted my bank - Maybank about this matter and they claimed that there is no communication from your side to refund my money. This problem has prolong for almost 2 months and this morning was the last straw as your store manager Mr Muhammad Hafiz claimed that the person in charge Jia Ying Lim has resigned and there s nothing else can be done to refund my money.  So  Tesco my question is: Is this how you treat your customer? Your loyal customer to be precise  as I shopped daily at Tesco S2 outlet Is Jia Ying Lim is the only person responsible on my money? Without this person  Tesco is malfuctioning? When can I get my money back. More than 1k has been ripped off from me for almost two months which can be used for my business.  I have all the original receipts  email communication print outs if your side is interested to settle this matter.Kindly give me the email address to send all the particulars. It is very embarrassing that this incident happened in a very large establishment as this can be prevented earlier during closing while printing the credit / debit card settlement report  because isn t it obvious that the total amount does not tally? I really hope that you can make the necessary actions to refund my money as soon as possible so that I do not need to take further action.

He came from behind us and we were both wearing hi viz jackets. I waved for him to slow down but he completely ignored me and as he came flying past me on my horse i ended up nearly being thrown off by my horse panicking and not knowing how to cope.

When i got there the assistant told me the price was £269.95 I said the price on the internet was £249.95.  She told me i had to go home and book this for click and collect next day to get it at this price.  How stupid is this rule?  i had the cash in my hand and wanted the laptop but she refused to give me it there and then.  Your loss Tesco as I went elsewhere and got one for the same price.

I noticed that the waistband and sticky tabs have changed to be a little more stretchy which is good  but am also finding them not very good at absorbing odour. Has the absorbency also changed when the waistband designed changed?  I thought it was a one off at first but we’ve gone through 3 packets now and still finding the strong smell of wee quite unpleasant. I was in your store this evening and needed to buy nappies  but found myself completely put off buying them and left without any. It’s a real shame.					2016-04-20T20:17:15+0000	1461183435	2016-04-20 22:17:15	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Tuesday this week I received a call from my delivery driver as he was outside (I wasn t home) I explained the misunderstanding and he said he would rectify this back at the store. I then checked the app and it just shows the original delivery details and contents and no sign of my rearranged delivery. Today I have been charged £24.43 for a delivery I did not want and have no goods to show for this.  I have been a delivery saver customer for 3yrs and am very disappointed. This is the 1st issue I have had with Tesco and am puzzled as to why the original order was not cancelled as I had requested.  Please can you advise how I can proceed with this further.					2016-04-20T20:15:51+0000	1461183351	2016-04-20 22:15:51	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was purchasing wine and cleaning wipes. The cashier of whom was a manager asked me for ID of which I had. I gave her my driving licence. She looked at my ID and said I look too different  she asked for a 2nd opinion  this lady didn t really say too much  just that I look older on my driving licence. I am 36 years old  it was very embarrassing. The cashier refused me the wine. I understand this is a legal obligation  but I had Id  had all my bank cards with my name on it and she still refused me. I could understand if I was 25 and borderline approval age  but I am 36!! It felt like she was just wanting to be difficult.  I wasn t happy with the way I was made to feel  I am a regular customer and was embarrassed and made to feel like I was trying to do something wrong.

I kept walking and told him yes I had and I m still NOT interested....   I was outside the entrance doors...about to call for a taxi.. he then came outside and started to ask me more about why I wasn t interested..... and what problems I d had before. ..I again told him NO I m not interested.. after a bit he did finally go back inside....  I came to do my shopping.. not to be harassed by Virgin...I constantly get stuff put through my door to promote Virgin....salesmen knocking on the door...and now when you go shopping you get harassed by them..

I know you hear this all the time however to witness a member of staff doing it I feel is appalling. There aren t many child spaces in car parks and for a member of staff to take a valuable space when there are plenty of other spaces available in the car park is unacceptable. She also parked so close to the back of my car I struggled to put the shopping in the back of the car.					2016-04-20T19:36:13+0000	1461180973	2016-04-20 21:36:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just witnessed threatening behaviour by one.of the cashiers at tesco express  North oxhill road  handsworth. A pensioner was the target of aggressive and threatening behavior at the pensioner. A customer told the worker to have some respect for the pensioner and the worker said I don t care if he s old.  I am absolutely disgusted with the behaviour. The worker is an Asian male with curly hair and a slight beard.  This is bad publicity for tesco that they employ such people. The security guard had to warn the worker to calm down. This happened today at 20:10 and will be on Cctv. I am the one in the green check shirt.					2016-04-20T19:22:41+0000	1461180161	2016-04-20 21:22:41	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have seen two cars pull into parent and toddler spaces with...shock/horror no kids 😤. I can t understand it! I have 3 kids but being without them I pulled into a parking space 4 down in a normal space. And there they go swanning into to store  even though there were loads of normal spaces and disabled if needed! Nobody in store as far as I can see bothers checking the parking even though signs clearly state disabled/parent and toddler. I wouldn t be surprised if the disabled spaces are used like this also. It completely astounds me that people can have such little respect for such simple things which are there to make people s lives easier 😕.					2016-04-20T19:07:50+0000	1461179270	2016-04-20 21:07:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is a regular occurrence  at this time of the evening when you reduce your foods to as little as a .1p.   All being a great bargain  except the response by the shoppers is getting out of control. Pushing fighting knocking people over it s frightening to see and I happen to be near by once or twice in the past too  to actually get pushed over.   Personally I would rather pay YOU DOUBLE!!  to give these items to the homeless or any other needing local shelter or charity  than witness such savage acts by people in my community.					2016-04-20T18:23:09+0000	1461176589	2016-04-20 20:23:09	0	5	0	0	5	4	3	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At 33 weeks pregnant this is not something I should be drinking as should anyone else and the fact this is still on the shelfs four days after its use by date and they happily sold it me at the counter!!!!!

ALAS! when we took the 2 out of the pack  we discovered that not only were they smaller than the other 3  one seems to be incomplete! Now I know that my husband and I haven t eaten the missing piece - we are both on a diet and are being oh so good on it! I also know that what with the kids going up to bed after their delicious treats  then rushing to get sorted for school today  and then not being out the kitchen alone at all  I am hoping that it wasn t a ghost or a mouse (we have neither) so the only conclusion is that the poor cookie has been separated from its other half at some point and the other half is either on some special mission to find its crumb buddy or it has crumbed it!

Last year I was buying these in bulk for 50p reduced from £1.  and freezing them for use in our caravan as Beefburger and onions and they were great BUT...  This year they were sneakily increased to £1-30 and the reduction on them is now 30p to bring them to the original price of £1 as they were last summer...  This is the type of sneakiness in reductions that is all over the media lately but if you know what to look for....

We live in a small remote community that is a very popular with tourists all year round and indeed is a regular stop off point on the North Coast 500 route a drive that has just been named most popular drive in the UK. I am very concerned that Tesco have decided to cease their click and collect service in the village for no apparent reason. The service is regularly used by locals not just the local business community and is often fully booked. With this in mind I cannot understand why you are stopping the service as the route that your service takes goes from Lairg to Wick via Kinlochbervie and subsequently has to pass through Durness anyway. I and many others in the community have been Tesco customers for many years and obviously we are feeling very let down by Tesco and your management. Is there any possibility for this decision to be reversed and if not can we at least have an honest explanation as to the reason behind your decision. If you are not prepared to provide an understandable reason I will have no choice but to inform all my visitors this year of the lack of caring that Tesco show to our community. In addition I will be in touch with the management of Asda in Tain to try and organise an alternative service.					2016-04-20T14:25:09+0000	1461162309	2016-04-20 16:25:09	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

They re not our normal purchase but having had a baby 8 days ago my husband asked me to buy him some of these cans so he had something easy to have for dinner on his own whilst I was in hospital. Unfortunately all 3 cans I purchased looked exactly the same! My husband s cookery skills extend to toasting bread and opening cans so I was concerned he might expire from starvation as a result but luckily he was able to survive on toast alone. Lol!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12994564_10153999499851136_118984871869122480_n.jpg?oh=194a9e582176b03efb155f4780884380&oe=590AEDCC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12994564_10153999499851136_118984871869122480_n.jpg?oh=b41c71525e2d257c9ef2b285b737e218&oe=58DADDB0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153999499851136&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-20T14:17:31+0000	1461161851	2016-04-20 16:17:31	6	6	8	0	14	6	2	4	1	0	6	0	0	2	0	0	0

Durness is a village that has B&B s like myself and rely on Tesco s. Durness is a very busy place with Tourists It s so disappointing that they have stopped right on the season starting. What we don t understand is they are going to Kinlochbervie 7 days a week so why can t they deliver too Durness on there way passed ?? I ve phoned the manager in Wick and too say he was unprofessional and rude was a understatement . Also sent 2 emails too yourselves and no questions answered. Yes we understand that 3 days is not paying but 1 day at least would defiantly pay. What about home delivery ? You do home delivery to the other village beside us Tongue. I think that Tesco s has let this small community down badly. Look forward too hearing back from you ASAP with proper answers. Jill Jackson  Roma Corbett Selena Campbell Tricia Morrison please add others and there is lots off others that use Tesco that are not on Facebook.					2016-04-20T10:18:24+0000	1461147504	2016-04-20 12:18:24	1	22	1	0	23	22	2	20	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought a pack of chicken in Stevenage Tesco Extra last Thursday which  as you can see  had a use by date of 18 April. I went to cook dinner on Monday evening (18 April) to find that the chicken had gone off - lots of rancid juices and it stank to high heaven. Needless to say it went straight in the bin - what a waste of money. It had been in the fridge since I bought it and it s not the first time I ve had this problem with fresh meat.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13001182_10153539521456430_5815003791889655935_n.jpg?oh=8b099fd76134fffc43d5685f684f332b&oe=59074357	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13001182_10153539521456430_5815003791889655935_n.jpg?oh=c921855e6649cfc7260eac237b2c047e&oe=5907705A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153539521456430&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-20T10:09:25+0000	1461146965	2016-04-20 12:09:25	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had not heard anything so I emailed yesterday to see what time it would come.  I eventually got a call back today from Hotpoint Logistics  who are delivering on behalf of Tesco and they informed me it won t be arriving until Wednesday 27th. I have no cooker and 2 children. I would not have ordered from Tesco if I had known I would be waiting 2 weeks. Before I ordered it said delivery on or before 20th.

This replacement mop has now stopped working after 15 months use. It has only been used once a week for 1 fill  which is enough to clean my kitchen and bathroom floors. I was pleased with its performance and the price is very reasonable.The problem seems to be with either the thermostat or element failing. Would a more expensive steam mop last longer? Is 15 months an expected lifespan for this product?					2016-04-20T09:22:01+0000	1461144121	2016-04-20 11:22:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just had an email from Tesco Direct telling me they won t be posting my review as  it doesn t meet the website guidelines  I suppose it doesn t when I gave an honest review of their product and service received and it was less than stellar! So  don t bother reading customer reviews on Tesco before buying as they only post the ones they like!					2016-04-20T07:16:17+0000	1461136577	2016-04-20 09:16:17	0	5	0	0	5	5	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There was no greeting (Hello  how can I help) when I asked the lady to check for an item of clothing in a certain size her response was  well wasn t it on the shop floor  obviously the answer was no otherwise I wouldn t have gone and asked for it to be checked. So she did not check to see of there was the size I wanted in stock  claiming there would be none out the back. I asked of she could please explain how to use the click and collect service for clothing and she grunted  she did explain but in a tone of voice which was pretty clear she did not want to help me! Not the service u expect from anywhere. I worked on customer service desk in retail for many years and still work in the same supermarket now as a teamleader. I d like to think she will be coached on her manners and attitude and actually be willing to help customers.					2016-04-20T00:30:31+0000	1461112231	2016-04-20 02:30:31	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

To those that know about it  they would spot it but for the local shopper in Maryhill they would not know what the Halal logo is and what goes on with it.  I am not happy at all that you have decided to sell Halal meat/livestock products.  The process in which the animal goes through to be slaughtered is barbaric.  It causes so much pain and suffering.  I am sure you are fully aware of the process.  I would not wish this on ANY living thing.  I ask that you reconsider selling these Halal products to help cut out on animal cruelty.  I wish to hear back on this matter  as if it is something that will continue to happen  then I would be looking to take my custom else where.  I use Tesco not only for my food shopping but also Petrol station and Finance products.  It deeply offends me that Tesco would be willing to allow suffering to animals by putting them through this process.    I look forward to hearing a reply.

We booked a home delivery for the 4th consecutive week..... Your driver couldn t find my house!  He had the postcode  he had the door number  He found the street  but not the house. The door has the house number on. The gate has the house number on. Each of the 3 wheelie bins has the number on and all 3 face the road (and they are day glow yellow)  Only a blind person could fail to spot the numbers on the house!  Yet your driver managed! I called at 9.54pm to find out if everything was OK as we were booked for a 9-10pm spot. I was told he couldn t find the house and he may be a new driver. The lady spoke to him and came back to say he was 4 miles away and would call me on the house phone shortly so I could talk him to my house.  I called back at 10.25pm again as the driver hadn t been in touch. The gentleman contacted the driver again  who now said he couldn t deliver as he was running late and didn t have time.  After some discussion it was decided that I would take my car to meet the delivery driver  who would call me in a few minutes to arrange where we could meet. I was given the drivers number incase he didn t call me (07xxx182679) I called several times from 10.55pm and didn t get an answer. Then I recived an email to advise my order had been cancelled and rescheduled for between 8pm and 9pm the following day.  Firstly   my street has 40-50 houses in and had been her for at least 50 years.  The postcode puts you to number 18 on a Tomtom which is just round the corner.  To find your way from number 18 you count the houses  or to be totally radical and think outside the box  you look at the doors for the NUMBERS!  It s suprisingly easy  taxi drivers  ambulances  police officers and various delivery drivers have managed to find the house without getting lost over the last 4 years I ve lived here!  But what s more frustrating then the incompetent driver not being able to find the house  it s the fact that 2 different members of your call centre team have out and out lied to me about the order  thus resulting in the order not being made and me spending 2 hours sat waiting for a delivery that was never going to happen!   You have now taken the money from my account for today s shopping (which will be refunded in 5 days or so) and you re going to collect more money tomorrow as the special offers we had selected ended today!!!!!  If your company is happy to accept drivers who can t find houses by looking at door numbers  and call centre workers who can t tell the truth I feel that it s maybe best if we part company  I m sorry  but as things stand next week I will be trying out ASDA S home delivery service.   I will add it s very much not me  it s YOU!					2016-04-19T22:34:35+0000	1461105275	2016-04-20 00:34:35	3	3	4	0	7	3	3	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	1	0

I bought some bread rolls yesterday from your store neots store bakery  when I went to eat one a little while ago I noticed something on the underside of the roll but thought it was just a dark Mark inside the bread. I carried on eating the roll until my teeth crunched on something I then swallowed and started choking for nearly 2 minutes unable to breath properly until  I coughed said item out and to my surprise I found that there was a f##king metal ball barring in my bread roll!!!!!!! Do you not have any quality control within your stores?? I could quite easily of choked to death or if a chilf swallowed it could of easily died!

I have already contacted your customer service team via online message and have received an almost duplicate reply as the previous week (although this was through a phone call). This does not fill me with confidence as to the possibility of an improvement. A bit of back ground I have been a loyal customer of yours for several years and spend in excess of 7K a year across your brands and have been using your home delivery service approaching 2 years. Below is a copy of my Messages for the past two weeks and the one typed reply (dated today) I have received.   I hope you can agree that this really does not make for good customer service and would appreciate another view point from Tescos.   My messages (the two I have copies of) Hi  I have just unpacked my delivery and once again I have items that do not meet your use by date promises. As follows: Clementines dated 14/4/16  Spring Onions 13/4/16 Crumpets 14/4/16 Last week I was promised that the store concerned would be informed and this would not happen again. Unfortunately things have gotten worse.  Additionally while the other items meet your use by date promises  I have only two products that actually exceed them. Whilst I appreciate that by their very nature fresh products have only short dates  I know by experience that longer dates would be available on most of them. Can I ask are you re pickers instructed to pick those items with the shortest date but that meet you re minimum promises?  I hope that you will be able to help with the above    Hi  As a follow on from last weeks feedback  this week all items are in date. But as last week  every single item matches the guaranteed days and apart from the dairy goods not a day more. I was assured last week that you would speak to the store as I was assured that the pickers should not be picking to only the shortest dates available. Today I was in a Tesco store and looked at the dates for the products. Apart from a couple of items (fresh fruit) the other items were available for longer dates then your minimum guarantees. So it is somewhat unbelievable that out of an entire shop not one product exceeded your given dates.  Unfortunately I shop on line to shop for the best I can for a week  with this situation recurring that is not possible. I will no longer be ordering fresh produce from yourselves and will stick to dry goods  and at the end of my delivery saver I will be looking for a alternative seller.   And Tescos reply. Thanks for your email. I’m responding on behalf of my colleague Russell  I hope you don’t mind. Firstly  I’m sorry if a number of items received as part of today’s online grocery order were at the minimum of our advised freshness guarantees. I can appreciate any disappointment this would cause  particularly if you contacted us last week with similar concerns about the dates that you’d received. Whilst I’m unsure as to which store you visited  I can advise that your orders are sent from our Dereham branch if you were unaware. Following on from my colleague’s report to the store last week  I’ll be sure to address this with the Home Shopping Manager at Dereham in an effort to ensure that the pickers are offering the longest possible dates available to them at the time of picking as we would expect. Now it might be the case that you were offered the longest dates that they had but I’ll happily raise this with the store and I’m hopeful that you’ll notice an improvement going forwards. In conclusion  I appreciate you taking the time to get in touch but if you have any further queries  please don t hesitate to contact us at: online@tesco.co.uk.					2016-04-19T19:51:55+0000	1461095515	2016-04-19 21:51:55	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered 1 X 500g bag of kp dry roasted peanuts but I have been delivered 1 X 450g bag (photo below). Just wondering if the other 50g are to follow or whether it is just a way of tesco making a bit extra cash? I have already messaged the Inverness store where they came from but received no response.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13012796_10153615393008226_1565793911937233689_n.jpg?oh=780d2c73d8d700f3f8c6d56bb3e059a3&oe=5905EF18	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13012796_10153615393008226_1565793911937233689_n.jpg?oh=ee8cdee9478f7fb61fd0ab52f8d4d21a&oe=58DD0215	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153615393008226&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-19T19:45:09+0000	1461095109	2016-04-19 21:45:09	20	6	20	2	28	6	4	2	5	0	20	0	0	0	0	0	0

My partner and I were just in your Transit Way branch and I can honestly say we received the worst service we have ever experienced.   We went to a checkout that was empty and started putting our shopping on the conveyor. As we approached the till staff  we were completely ignored as he was having a light hearted conversation with another colleague that just kept coming over and standing near the checkout to chat with him. When I say we were ignored  what I actually mean is: - We were not greeted. - We were not asked if we had or required bags. - He just started scanning stuff and sliding it towards us (hadn t even made eye contact and was still in discussion with his colleague.) - We had to interrupt him to ask for a wine carrier (which he got out without saying a word to us but still chatting with his colleague.) - Once everything was scanned he just carried on chatting and my partner held her club card out to him waiting for him to respond. - He scanned it (still without speaking to us or even letting us how much the total was.) - My partner put her payment card in the machine without any clue of the total and not a word from the cashier.) - Once the transaction was completed  he handed us our receipt and said  cheers  whilst STILL not even looking at us and paying full attention to his colleague.  We picked up our shopping and left. I would have complained to the team leader/manager running the front end but unfortunately that was the colleague that our cashier was chatting to.  I personally was absolutely disgusted with the service and working in the public domain and in customer service myself  if I had seen a member of my staff act in that way it would not have gone unnoticed and I DEFINITELY wouldn t have been there encouraging it.  My transaction details are: 19/04/16  19:13  3039  023  1337  2480  Mike Scott					2016-04-19T18:51:19+0000	1461091879	2016-04-19 20:51:19	0	4	0	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The home built BBQ is still a pile of bricks but me and the family thought it would be great to eat outside. I popped to your Fraserburgh store and grabbed some sausages  chicken and buns  and I also picked up a disposable BBQ  In fact they were such a good price I picked up 3. (Yes I am in Scotland but was feeling optimistic.)It took me all 3 family party grills to cook 4 sausages and 3 chicken legs and in the end we cooked them in our kitchen. They didn t work folks.  I was a student so have used these hundreds of times before with no problems but all three were duds. lots of flame then nothing  an hour later all the coals still black and no heat.  Possibly damp??? Either way how do I return three burnt out BBQs and claim they didn t work?? You may of ruined my whole summer (Scotland) so I would at least like my money back. Thanks in advance...					2016-04-19T18:31:46+0000	1461090706	2016-04-19 20:31:46	1	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

I came out feeling very anxious for my daughter and myself safety  I understand this member of staff was trying to raise the alarm about possible people getting robbed at the cash point but in causing quite a fuss she has made me : A) not to feel safe using your cashpoint  B ) FEARFUL FOR MY SAFETY  when I came out and a further person was by the door also on his phone   was he involved ? I don t know but I couldn t get from their fast enough.

I placed an order to be collected on Saturday the 16th to turn up to be told it hasn t been received  bearing in mind this was for a birthday gift for a friend. It is now the 19th  I have only found out my order is ready for collection by me chasing this myself and not by receiving an email to adobes this is ready to be collected. I had also sent an email via your online form with no reply on Sunday. I actually paid £2 for the the privilege of collecting the item myself which itself is ridiculous. I d like by £2  collection charge  refunded please and I will be sure to avoid using your services in future.					2016-04-19T17:06:03+0000	1461085563	2016-04-19 19:06:03	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Until now!!!! You have changed the design and my son has had 3 poop explosions since using this new design (around 5 days) measuring the new nappies against the old they are slightly smaller which is obviously the issue! But now I have three packs of nappies which I can t use and I can t return as I m not near a store!!! Very disappointed 😔 & even more annoyed that I ve had to throw away 3 ruined outfits!					2016-04-19T16:49:40+0000	1461084580	2016-04-19 18:49:40	1	8	1	0	9	8	4	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Visit my brother every other Monday over in Basildon.  Went in store yesterday to do his shopping. Left my card in chip and pin machine. Only realised when I went shopping back here in Kent earlier today. Phoned the store spoke to customer services. Confirmed card was there. She suggested my brother could collect it. I said no as he s a vulnerable adult. But asked if my husband could as I had to go to work. Bear in mind it s a 120 mile round trip  fuel and crossing charges. She said yes that s fine. Tell him to bring ID. Told her we have same account so he can show her his bank card and drivers licence. She said that s perfect. He gets there an hour later only to be told they can t give him it and only I can pick it up. So now I have to do another 120 mile round trip more fuel and crossing charges! Yes my stupid fault for leaving it there. But just as much your fault for wasting my time and money running around because your staff are poorly trained!					2016-04-19T15:42:59+0000	1461080579	2016-04-19 17:42:59	0	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

So today me and my partner entered the store and we were nearly physically sick   In short the front of the store really does stink of stale urine. I m sorry to say but I won t be shopping in this store again until this problem is fixed  I cannot on the nature of the smell guarantee my own or my family s health especially when uncovered fruit and vegetables are 20 yards away   I have refrained from contacting local environmental health etc as I thought best to let you guys know first  Yours faithfully ✊🏼					2016-04-19T15:09:57+0000	1461078597	2016-04-19 17:09:57	4	17	4	0	21	17	10	7	10	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m not sure where to leave feedback for one of your staff at the Mansfield - chesterfield road tesco  so hope this gets to the lady  I didn t get her name though! We were walking down the aisle of fridges when my 3 year old son ran  tripped over his dad s foot and face planted the trolley  one of your male workers asked if he was OK as the thud he made was horrendous and he screamed so loud! Then a woman came from running out from the deli area (she had short blondish hair  wearing a white coat and white hat) with a cold damp cloth to help with the bruising  she appeared so fast it was fab! I d just like to say a massive thank you to her for her help and the fact she cared so much was amazing! Hope this message gets to the lady!

As packaging has now changed I double checked ingredients and saw the description says gluten free oat flour but the ingredients list now just says Oat Flour.  On the original packaging it says Gluten Free Oat Flour. Please can you confirm the oat flour is gluten free and if it is then I think the ingredients list should be amended.

One time the sandwich dried out before I could eat it  I still had to as there was no choice. Another time the filling leaked out into the rest of the things in my briefcase.  A month ago  I was charged full price for sandwiches that were marked down for immediate sale. This was because the floor staff did nothing to obscure the normal barcode.  What is the response each time? Bring it back with the receipt and we can give you a refund. How useless is that? If I don t eat it  I have no lunch that day. There is no where to buy a replacement within miles.   This is why I go to the Coop or Sainsbury s when there s a choice. Tesco s only form of customer service is a blank apology and no effort to fix broken processes.					2016-04-19T07:04:24+0000	1461049464	2016-04-19 09:04:24	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Though I think there is still more tesco can do. It isn t just about diet but animal welfare and the environmental issues at stake. There is so much animal abuse either at farms  especially intensive farming of livestock and also in slaughter houses. A plant based diet has always  and will always be healthier than a heavy dairy and meat based diet. The obesity crisis can be helped by a plant based diet  not to mention type 2 diabetes  heart disease and many other conditions. The meat and dairy industries are a drain on resources  ie food and water. They are also massively subsidised by the tax payer.  I also know that Quorn are going fully vegan purely by demand  by leaving out egg in the mixture. I have yet to see any in tesco stores. I cannot eat too much soya so I and many others are awaiting these products.					2016-04-19T07:01:03+0000	1461049263	2016-04-19 09:01:03	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our house burnt down on 1st April destroying everything we own.  I went into tesco in havant to get some items we needed for the house and to ask for some hangers as we have none.  The 2 young ladies in the clothing section said not a problem and would get a large box of the for me for free. When they came back with them they brought to senior staff members too. The 2 girls had told them what had happened to our house and said they would sort out the list if items I needed to get and took me to the cafe for a cup of tea.  This was above and beyond anything I could imagine. They were so lovely and caring just as everyone has been since this terrible accident happened.  Thank you doesn t seem quite enough for how myself  Roger (my husband) Alex (15 yr Old son) & charley (11 yr old son) feel about all that we have received from family  friends and strangers.					2016-04-18T20:39:23+0000	1461011963	2016-04-18 22:39:23	31	4	38	1	43	4	2	2	3	0	30	7	0	0	0	0	0

Now if you travel at more then the 20mph limit your car wheels will throw stones about and hit other motorists which nobody wants but this is where my complain comes in..... One of your lovely drivers must have been in a hurry as he decides to come speeding down the road well over the 20mph limit and guess what..... He has chipped my windscreen! Absolutely fuming  I now have to pay for a new windscreen thanks to your incompetent driver.

I have been a good and loyal Tesco customer for many years and have also been having my groceries delivered for quite some time.  Tonight I needed to place a large order for guests arriving tomorrow.  However I am being  blocked  from entering the site.  The possible reasons given are that my address is invalid or there is a problem with the address they have for me on the system. I have been on to Customer Services for half an hour  but they have concluded that they cannot help me - no advice given  no possible solutions and worst of all NO REASON GIVEN for this happening.  I cannot tell you the implications of this to both myself and others.  So tesco if you cannot get it sorted you will lose a very good customer  I will be recounting my experience Social Media and I will be telling everyone how little regard you have for your customers.  If you can be bothered investigating my Clubcard number is 634004 024076237843.  Meanwhile I will see if Sainsbury s can help me out.					2016-04-18T19:04:00+0000	1461006240	2016-04-18 21:04:00	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We both took a mouthful and said together   rhubarb  not apple  Seems your pie was wrongly labeled. There was only 2 left and one was rhubarb so I looked at the other and it was apple. Label in pic as proof.  Bought from Harford bridge Norwich.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13001034_10209024089583534_8349797396973658020_n.jpg?oh=a8b6aeb606caa42ea3975e3ea4f43b71&oe=5919715A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13001034_10209024089583534_8349797396973658020_n.jpg?oh=647297f3a4ad87479cafc96d6853982a&oe=590A4A57	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209024089583534&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-18T19:03:21+0000	1461006201	2016-04-18 21:03:21	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As you can see from my grocery order confirmation below  I ordered 995Kg of Tesco Tomato Ketchup in bulk and yet you only sent me one bottle. You have not delivered the majority of my ketchup. The member of staff who gathered my order is quite clearly an imbecile. It appears to me your picker would have great difficulty counting the buttons on their Tesco shirt.  I spent the majority of last week clearing out my loft to store my bulk order. I stupidly decided to keep the portrait of my hero and your Chief Executive Dave Lewis. Dave was originally positioned above the fire place  however he recently moved in to my loft after you squashed my loaf the other week and I could no longer bring myself to look at him.  I have a rare skin condition  and I noticed one day when I came in to contact with your brand of ketchup that it was a great soothing agent. Although it is not fit for human consumption due to the amount of added chemicals  it is an effective moisturiser. I have since bathed in Tesco ketchup twice a day  so you can imagine my fury after I ran out and a rash returned in an intimate place due to your error.  Please either send me the rest of my ketchup  or compensate me for the rash you have caused.  Yours furiously   Andrew Hill	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13043401_592729250888649_2895066538961381393_n.jpg?oh=ecafd4a978dfba531a068b1377fa9a0d&oe=592415C5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13043401_592729250888649_2895066538961381393_n.jpg?oh=6dd74b06f63497bf292cd5eed566afd4&oe=590EF83A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=592729250888649&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-18T18:20:08+0000	1461003608	2016-04-18 20:20:08	25	25	36	16	77	24	16	8	55	0	25	0	0	10	0	0	0

Having recently returned home after surgery I was very grateful to be able to place an online order and have it delivered to my home. I chose things that I thought would make it easy to feed my family and myself while I recover  and tonight s choice was Cottage Pie... What a disappointment. The layer of meat/veg/gravy was so thin as to be nonexistent at places across the pie - nothing like the picture shown on the sleeve. According to your packaging the pie serves four but using the meat from the whole pie and the potato from half I only managed to create two almost decent servings  one each for my partner and seven year old son... I ll have to find something else for me... Not normally a buyer of ready meals and certainly won t be picking this one again... ☹					2016-04-18T17:57:13+0000	1461002233	2016-04-18 19:57:13	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My weekly shop for two people was delivered in 11 plastic bags and two paper bags. Seven of those bags contained only one item  each of which could easily have fit inside one of the other bags. This really isn t acceptable.  What is the point in individuals reducing their plastic bag use and trying to recycle if big corporations like Tesco can t even get it right.					2016-04-18T17:21:00+0000	1461000060	2016-04-18 19:21:00	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am writing to commend the Customer Services team at Lowestoft (Gunton) store. When told that a Tesco candle in a glass jar had cracked and caused £23 000 of smoke damage to my partners home they were fantastic. They were hoping to be able to reimburse me for the loss of my handbag and contents which I was not able to claim for on my partners insurance as I don t live with him. However  the Customer Service manager  in Dundee who had not seen the damage to the house  my partners 2 teenage children having to stay at friends since the fire  and my partner having to stay with me as the house was uninhabitable was altogether the opposite. She rejected the claim with no empathy  sympathy  was totally dismissive  very rude and actually very argumentative. My partner and I are professional people  I am a nurse and my partner is a warehouse manager for an oil and gas company. We were treated like benefits cheats trying to pull a fast one.!  This fire has caused emotional stress as well as financial loss. My handbag contained my phone  car keys  money etc all that I have had to replace. My partner is unable to have a family life at present as his family is split until the house is repaired. This will be another 8 to 12 weeks.  Also no mention has been made about the faulty candle which the Fire Service stated was the cause of the fire as it became too hot and cracked. I would say that was a fault with the product  wouldn t you?   Kind Regards  Gary Minister and Julie Smith.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12987196_1233210836689500_3217541867751033586_n.jpg?oh=51433e445d3d521f6e952aad8f28f9b9&oe=590C8BDE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12987196_1233210836689500_3217541867751033586_n.jpg?oh=922237540fbd9a8bb1b94e1ba02094a4&oe=5913DC65	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1233210836689500&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-18T16:43:35+0000	1460997815	2016-04-18 18:43:35	3	19	5	0	24	17	14	3	9	0	3	0	0	0	0	2	0

I know you already offer support in other directions but I have a simple solution to public speculation. At the end of every day the food bank box is passed through a till and the calculated profit donated directly to the food banks. This would be of double benefit to the food banks and still not cost you any more than a little lost profit. Every little counts.					2016-04-18T13:31:53+0000	1460986313	2016-04-18 15:31:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  today I received my online grocery delivery and everything and I mean EVERYTHING was covered in spilt milk 😔 your delivery driver will vouch for me as he kindly refunded the milk for me. However  all my shopping smells horrible now even after rinsing it all. Some items like loose vegetables and anything in paper packets is spoilt 👎🏼 can I get a further refund please as I will have to replace more food than me and the driver originally thought. Your driver said it happens a lot with milk - there must be a better way to transport it to avoid this happening again? Thank you for any help you can give me!

Today when I was paying for my fuel the staff were laughing about a lady on there forecourt who had forgotten her purse and had next to no fuel in her car and only £3 worth of change in her car and she lives in Coventry.  They were pretty much betting on how far she could get on £3. She was sat in her car very upset and trying her best ringing people... I m happy to say I came to her rescue and have put £10 in her car to get her home and unfortunately your staff need to also be trained on how to be nicer people					2016-04-18T12:31:06+0000	1460982666	2016-04-18 14:31:06	7949	976	8754	999	10729	941	681	260	1811	0	7811	134	35	0	32	594	0

I ve spoken to Quorn and they told me you were the only supermarket to stock it. They told me Tesco had de-listed the item therefore they no longer produce it!!  PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!  It can t be due to supply and demand as I had to stockpile this item to ensure I had them in  as they were often sold out!!  Come on Tesco I know your streamlining and decreasing product lines  but you have always provided a great veggie choice - don t stop now!

I just received a very poor service from your customer service team through Tesco Direct which I was very shocked with as I have always had a good experience with your team. I received a faulty item from one of your partners and the woman I spoke to about it was very rude  patronising in her manner and very unhelpful. At one point I couldnt hear her and she shouted down the phone. She just sounded like she did not want to be there and after I said that I could not be in from Monday-Friday for the partner to pick up the faulty item and could they issue me with a returns label instead she sounded very irritable and said that the partner has only said between those days which I think is unfair as why should I take time off work to wait for somebody to collect an item that was faulty to begin with?? Her attitude was terrible and she practically put the phone down on me. After the call I am still none the wiser on what to do with my faulty item! Could you please advise? I feel very let down. Thanks Cathy					2016-04-18T11:24:53+0000	1460978693	2016-04-18 13:24:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have complained twice to customer service over 3 mths and to date it remains the same.  I don t eat animals bodies or their by-products. When I go to the vegetarian/vegan freezer section to buy my food   I don t expect to have severed legs and limbs of animals on sale  scattered amongst the food I have to look at and buy!  There is so little on offer that doesn t contained battered  abused broken bodies in the supermarket  and the few things that are actually on offer  I now will refuse to buy from tesco because of their stocking policy.  Tesco seem to think it is some  fad diet  so group it together with  free from anything you can think of  foods  so they put bags of dead chicken nuggets in the section  dead chicken medallions (whatever that is? lets just call it flesh shall we?) etc.  I happened to pick some up thinking I may just get some for the kids  assuming it was vegetarian since IT WAS in the VEGETARIAN section  but was horrified to find it wasn t!  maybe it s someones idea of a sick shelf stocking joke?  I have complained to customer service politely twice over the last 3 months and explained it from our point of view.  To those who eat the flesh of animals  they are desensitised to waht it actually is  so just think we are making a  fuss over nothing .  From the point of view of people who abstain from these foods  we see  when we look in the freezer  not just a misplaced box of food  but infact the broken torn body parts of the most abused kind of animals in the agriciultural industry- A chicken  who is unfortunate enough to live only a short 35 days (instead of 10-20 yrs) and then cruelly slaughtered  all so they can become junk food.  It is highly offensive that Tesco is so inconsiderate in the respect and i am fed up with our supermarket doing nothing about it.  Would you put Pork legs in the Kosher section of a London supermarket? I think probably not.  Please be considerate and make it an across the board stocking policy in EVERY  store   that in at least ONE  area of the supermarket  we are not having abused animals shoved in our face whilst we are trying to shop? Until that time  I have decided that we will no longer be purchasing any products from that section.  Thank you.					2016-04-18T11:22:51+0000	1460978571	2016-04-18 13:22:51	50	136	57	2	195	111	34	77	298	0	49	4	0	0	2	1	0

I placed my direct order with next day delivery but it s been missed. This is 2016 and you don t expect to be told your parcel will turn up today without a timeframe window. Now having disappointed children again I give up with you till you use a half decent company again.

Bought these bananas at your Chester store on the Greyhound Retail Park yesterday afternoon thinking they d be lovely chopped up in porridge  open one up to be greeted by this! Gross! Ironically I was asked to complete a questionnaire by one of your staff members yesterday about your fruit and veg and I said I do not normally visit your store but did on this occasion as it was closer to my home. Will definitely return to Morrisons in future  fruit and veg stay fresher for so much longer.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q89/s130x130/13012717_477281215808612_4921172729749904147_n.jpg?oh=fc74ca8f7ee4411cf1756c954c472473&oe=5923F025	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q89/s720x720/13012717_477281215808612_4921172729749904147_n.jpg?oh=2e844a7154ed0a44520f83d213042fee&oe=58DD09CF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=477281215808612&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-18T07:06:18+0000	1460963178	2016-04-18 09:06:18	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We decide to give the scan and pack devise another go  which I was dubious about because the last few times I d been subjected to random checks  and set off. We literally had less than 10 items in our bag and yet we still got a random check!   A young girl by the name of Georgie came over and when I explained to her that this was in fact the 4th time I d been  chosen  for a random check she said that that s what happens for the first 6 times of using the service and that most people actually speak to a member of staff before registering. Well I didn t because there was no need I believed. You literally scan your clubcard  enter your postcode and accept the terms and conditions (which are so tiny on the screen you need a magnifying glass). Anyway after explaining this to Georgie  who by the way hadn t greeted us just literally started pulling all our shopping out of the bag  she got quite flippant and just kept repeating that most people speak to a member of staff and it happens the first 6 times. So I suggested that maybe there should be some kind of sign or something beside the scanners to warn customers of this and still Georgie just repeated herself over and over. By their point my partner and I were getting quite angry because  she just wasn t listening to us and this whole time hadn t even bothered to look at us.   Finally she finished what she had to do  snatched the basket from the stand  turned her back and flounced off! No sorry for the inconvenience  no I ll forward your suggestion literally nothing. She just stomped off like a child. I d had enough so asked her colleague for a manager  who came pretty quickly but was very nervous. I explained what had happened and all he did was repeat what Georgie said about how the system does random checks the first 6 shops lol (not quite random if it s actually going to happen each time). He explained that it was in the T&Cs that you agree to when registering so I again suggested that part be more clearly stated. I said that my real problem wasn t the stupid rules of the scanning it was in fact the rudeness and compete ignorance of his member of staff (who by the was was around the corner crying to a customer who had walked in saying how if been horrible to her) and all he said was he d have a word. He did apologise but it was quite back handed especially when he said that Georgie was only doing her job trying to explain the system.   Honestly Customer Service is not complicated. Speak politely and treat customers who are spending money in your shop with respect. That s what you get paid for. This whole situation has put me off using the scan and pack again. I thought the point was to be able to get in and out quickly but yesterday it took as long to check out with under 10 items than it would if I had a massive trolley full.					2016-04-18T06:35:53+0000	1460961353	2016-04-18 08:35:53	0	13	0	0	13	12	7	5	21	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday my niece (8 on Tues) shut the car door on her thumb just before we entered the store. Now I don t mean just went to shut the door and it bounced off her thumb  I mean the door was fully shut on her thumb! My sister took her to the customer services desk  briefly said what had happened and asked for an ice pack. Within seconds a first aider was with us attending to my niece. After applying ice and calming my niece down the first aider then gave her a free choccy bar (sugars for shock)! She also refused to leave until my niece had moved her thumb so we knew it wasn t broken! Other than a pretty impressive bruise she s fine. But honestly your staff were amazing x					2016-04-17T21:22:50+0000	1460928170	2016-04-17 23:22:50	3	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

My mum and I popped into the store at Great Notley as we have done regularly since the store first opened  but today was different.... My mum was aggressively bullied by a fellow customer as she waited patiently for staff to bring out the discounted fresh food. This particular customer not only got verbally abusive but also physical  to the point where he was pushing people out of the way to get to the items that were marked down. This customer made many of the women around increasingly uneasy and at one point they became rather scared by the behaviour of this man  resulting my mum making a complaint and speaking to the Duty Manager about this incident...  This is not the first time this customer has pushed people out of the way to get to what he wants  a few days ago a small girl was pushed to the ground. I have witnessed a lot of aggressive behaviour between customers when I have been in the store as produce is being discounted  I completely understand that Tesco need to protect their staff  but this is totally beside the point... On a number of occasions I have witnessed staff just leave the trolley of food which has been marked down in the middle of an isle  this is only creating more problems as customers literally battle to get there first... If this continues someone is going to get seriously hurt.. I believe that the way this store marks down produce that is going out of date needs to be revisited... I expect to be able to shop in my local store in peace.					2016-04-17T19:28:39+0000	1460921319	2016-04-17 21:28:39	0	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Thank you to the member of staff in the cafe  who heard our daughter screaming in pain & came over & distracted our little girl enabling me to give her some calpol to relieve her pain.   Thank you to the random female customer (with the little girl sat in the trolley) who heard the calls over the tannoyed for a first aider & dropped her shopping to come & find us & helped calm the situation.   Thank you to Hannah the Tesco trading manager for taking us away from onlooking customers to a more private area of the store where she constantly praised our little girl for being brave & gave her a balloon & sweets to distract her from her pain.   For what was a horrendous ordeal for both our daughter & us as parents was made so much calmer from the selflessness of a few people that went out of their way to support us. After taking her to A & E yesterday  she is now back to her cheeky self today. Please share this message in hope it gets to the strangers that didn t stand & stare but went out of their way to help us. Thank you 😊	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13015103_10156761587670623_781889338789557057_n.jpg?oh=c89005a83d9150383ac67c16af6d5d8b&oe=591CB64D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13015103_10156761587670623_781889338789557057_n.jpg?oh=e936b65e71d24460f0c9288b3a340442&oe=59211B58	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156761587670623&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-17T18:46:03+0000	1460918763	2016-04-17 20:46:03	6	3	6	0	9	2	2	0	2	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your staff was bringing out reduced items in cages and they was getting absolutely hounded by customers. All items were reduced to 2p etc but this was an absolute disgrace. People were fighting  arguing  grabbing everything all for some cheap food. It was so degrading to watch. The customers were grabbing anything/everything not even reading what it was all because of the price. So many of us were shocked and appalled that this was being allowed. It was very very embarrassing to whiteness. Why can t you give the food to local food banks of to charity instead of having such horrible scenes in the middle of your stores !! 😡					2016-04-17T15:42:00+0000	1460907720	2016-04-17 17:42:00	2	17	2	0	19	17	9	8	8	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

In fact it s the only bread stocked in supermarkets that is safe for him to eat. Why would you stop sticking something when it is the only product on the market? And why would you have no notice of this in any of your stores? Had I known I would of stocked up and frozen. Now  I am in a situation where my son has 2 slices of bread left and I m unable to source anymore without ordering online and waiting days for delivery (and also paying £10 delivery for each loaf of bread I order from the manufacturer!).

What a nerve 😡 I have also had issues with bread products e.g. mouldy pitta bread both on display and had to take a packet back as they went mouldy 2 days before sell by date. Poor management of this store. Even stock control is a mess ref sell by dates on display of products. Management need to step up. Poor  poor show with many staff looking like they just don t want to be there. No effort. One member of staff especially on fruit and veg  miserable as sin.

I took my son s Hudl 2 back (still in warranty) due to a faulty touch screen. The hudl was sent away for repair but unfortunately not fixed on return. I asked for a refund  as a replacement wasn t available. I paid using x4 Clubcard points  so was expecting £25 worth of points to be credited back to my Clubcard account. The staff in-store said points aren t refundable  which I find surprising! So  I am left with an unusable Hudl and no way of getting a refund of my points  is this right?					2016-04-17T12:54:21+0000	1460897661	2016-04-17 14:54:21	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just taken this screen shot from your website which shows that you have stated the Graco Milestone is suitable rear facing until 18kg when in fact it is only suitable until 13kg.  You also state that it s suitable to be used as a high back belt positioning booster from 13kg when the minimum LEGAL uk weight is 15kg.  I know this has been brought to your attention previously but you continue to display this information despite being made fully aware of your errors.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12718020_10154124771288594_755651238052836369_n.jpg?oh=e099f7ba32183cd0091196576d4c1f94&oe=5910F6DF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12718020_10154124771288594_755651238052836369_n.jpg?oh=c0e04889ccd305b6ba5646146fe6a68e&oe=58DBB3CA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154124771288594&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-17T12:19:41+0000	1460895581	2016-04-17 14:19:41	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am a mother of a multiple allergy child and I have been purchasing Bfree bread from your stores for some time as that is the ONLY bread my wheat egg dairy soya free child can eat. Sometimes when I try to buy It the bread is out of stock but recently I haven t seen it at all  no ticket etc. last night I spoke to a duty manager from your Toton branch who couldn t really give me a straight answer to wether you still sell it or not but did mention they are having a brand reset which is where you get rid of the brands that don t sell well. So I ask you -  How can you get rid of a brand that is mostly out of stock because it doesn t sell well?  Why if you have gotten rid of the brand are you still selling the wraps? If you are no longer selling this brand are you looking to stock an alternative?  Being an allergy mum is bad enough without supermarkets changing things with no notice!!!  I can t wait to hear from you. Thanks X					2016-04-17T10:52:52+0000	1460890372	2016-04-17 12:52:52	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve used your nappies since my little girl was born nearly 3 years ago but the last lot of nappies I bought are awful!! We do them up as tight as we can but they slip down while she is wearing them and then she leaks on to her clothes. I ve never had to change her nappies as much as I do now. Most mornings she is soaked though. They are just too stretchy now. My husband is taking them back to your Addlestone as I type. We will have to find another brand of nappies to use					2016-04-17T09:44:57+0000	1460886297	2016-04-17 11:44:57	2	7	2	0	9	7	6	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Lost track of the amount of times milk had gone thick as yoghurt long before the  best before  date is reached too. Not helping our budget and aims to try and provide my family with a healthy diet whatsoever. Disappointed.  Blueberries bought the 14th  photo taken on the morning of the 15th. It won t let me add another photo but also just opened a new Cravendale semi skimmed milk with best before date of 29.04.16 that looks like yoghurt.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12993365_10153426757936956_7726474940611208890_n.jpg?oh=87517d1fd7969d36a69ad23e07faaeb9&oe=591D8B45	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12993365_10153426757936956_7726474940611208890_n.jpg?oh=8da5cea736107c0cb69652e07ff60355&oe=58DDB631	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153426757936956&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-17T09:26:35+0000	1460885195	2016-04-17 11:26:35	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They are the  novelty  seats featuring Batman  TMNT and the like. Since these seats only meet the basic safety requirements to be used as intended the consequences of using them past the approved limits could be fatal.  If you can t get basic information like this correct then you should not be allowed to sell safety devices such as car seats!			http://www.tesco.com/direct/kids-embrace-batman-car-seat-group-123/230-7532.prd?pageLevel&skuId=230-7532#product-details-container	tesco.com	2016-04-17T08:33:39+0000	1460882019	2016-04-17 10:33:39	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The assistant was totally switched and got out the allergy book and even double checked I assume with the chef as to what was gluten free.

The experience and food option was quite positive and if possibly please pass on my thanks to the counter assistants.					2016-04-16T22:08:51+0000	1460844531	2016-04-17 00:08:51	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I put the order in a year ago  and just moved house. No problem you might think  the game has been delayed for another month  just change the address. Not so...  On enquiring about this I was told  essentially   Computer says no.....  and that they couldn t change the delivery address for whatever reason. Their ONLY suggestion? Cancel there order and replace it.   Ah  says I  that s a bit awkward as I placed the order via a special offer  and used Clubcard points to do it. I don t think you d be refunding me the value of the game so that I could simply reorder it? Or do you have any other suggestions or solutions? Could you change it to click and collect?  Nope. Only suggestion is to cancel. No options. No suggestions. No help. No customer care. Just cancel. I pushed a little  and subsequently was replied to by someone who called me by your staff members name ( Dianne? Really?) And then when i requested the issue was treated as a complaint  I was essentially told that the onus was on me to ensure that I PAID for a redirection  despite the fact that I was giving you a month s notice to change the address.   To call the service poor is an understatement. To say I m annoyed  even more so.   Sort yourself out Tesco  and possibly employ Customer service people with a) initiative and b) Customer Service skills.					2016-04-16T21:49:30+0000	1460843370	2016-04-16 23:49:30	1	7	1	0	8	6	4	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s virtually impossible to shop in store due to our local store only having one disabled child trolley which is all ripped and very rarely available as they keep trying to put it in the back as its broken.

Bargains galore  brilliant customer service  smiles all around  even when the store was heaving  with customers. Never a harsh word from staff  who are well trained. My shopping was cheaper than other supermarkets.  Thank you for making my weekend an enjoyable experience  bought some pizzas that were on special and nothing left. I bought 3. They were lovely.					2016-04-16T20:37:46+0000	1460839066	2016-04-16 22:37:46	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Some days I think  ...know what would just top this day off?! A cardboard cup of sugary goodness to dip my sweaty little digits in  and pull out the golden nectar; a fried egg . That s how much I like a Pick n Mix.   This afternoon  after spending around 2 hours in the garden  going back and forth with the mower  I thought  ...know what would just top this day off!? A cardbo...  you get the drift...  So  as excited as Phil Mitchell at happy hour in the Queen Vic  I dove into my motorised vehicle and made my way to your store  gleefully hopped in the door and grinned at the wondrous selection on offer to tempt my tastebuds. I made my choice  mouth watering and all  took it to the till (self service  5p for a bag an  that) and made my way home to devour each and every sugary lump of glory...  ...first out: A FRIED EGG!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!?! This was just too exciting. I waited patiently as I held it between my fingers and took in the moment. With that  I threw it in and couldn t wait for the taste sensation to tickle my tastebuds...  Hard. Rock Solid. I like Pick n Mix  but I also like my teeth...I d rather they weren t smashed into bits at the mercy of a single fried egg. This batch seems to be a little  overcooked   Tesco and it has simply not topped this day off. The bananas weren t any better.   Yours Pick n Mixingly  Craig 🍳  P.S the Cola Bottles were fine  so good job on that.					2016-04-16T20:30:49+0000	1460838649	2016-04-16 22:30:49	2	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

This is not the first incident with this shop. So I went with my friend who had purchased and half eaten the product to return item and yes got a basic refund and another item  however the service was dreadful. NO apology  No sense of it. The team leader couldn t even bother to look me in the eye with any sense of contrition. 4 days is totally unacceptable and considering the harm that can come from consuming out of date products  I really feel the service was not worthy of someone who is in an elevated position as team leader. Disgusting Tesco  truly not worthy of your ethic of treating others how you wish to be treated yourself.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12994476_10153345870211537_2596758619536072838_n.jpg?oh=d04234ff3a95c54c33c591b4cdc5f191&oe=5905A51C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12994476_10153345870211537_2596758619536072838_n.jpg?oh=b67ab380f0eb290874050651a2ed31d7&oe=59180B11	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153345870211537&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-16T20:00:56+0000	1460836856	2016-04-16 22:00:56	1	4	1	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

While walking down an aslie i noticed an elderly gent was sat on a crate of beer. He struggled to stand and had taken a  turn . Before i could say anything the Tesco staff were there...looking after him..got him a chair. Sorted his groceries  out and when we left the store  it looked like they were making sure he got home safe. In today s society when we always seem to see the worst...this was by far the best. Well done the lovely Tesco staff in Seacroft.					2016-04-16T19:54:33+0000	1460836473	2016-04-16 21:54:33	5	1	5	1	7	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Could you please tell me what your policy is on your staff members parking in the parent and child spaces (he didn t have a child  and was obviously just starting work) in the mean time I struggled with a normal space.					2016-04-16T18:25:25+0000	1460831125	2016-04-16 20:25:25	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son just used his birthday money to buy a Simpsons level pack for his Lego dimensions  only to discover it would ve been £5 cheaper at GAME.

Jestem bardzo zawiedziony zakupami w Tesco na ulicy Długiej we Wrocławiu. Niejednokrotnie robiłem tam zakupy  nie raz nie pasowała mi jakość niektórych produktów  aczkolwiek mam tam najbliżej i nie stwarzałem problemów. Dzisiaj ze znajomymi kupiliśmy mięso na grila marki Tesco i kiełbaski marki Sokołów. Niestety po otwarciu opakowań wydobywał sie bardzo specyficzny i obrzydliwy zapach. Śmierdziało w całym domu przez długi czas mimo wietrzenia. Kiełbaski byly w dziwnej mazi  mięso było w przyprawach i wyglądało normalnie  jednak zapach był nie do zniesienia. Stwierdziliśmy  ze usmażymy je na grilu. Mięso smakowało jednak jak zepsute. Uważam  ze to miejsce jest słabo pilnowane i konsumenci mogą sie przez to struć i mieć problemy ze zdrowiem. Mimo bliskiej odległości nie zamierzam juz robić tam zakupów. Pisze to  ponieważ przestrzegam wszystkich okolicznych mieszkańców przed tym Tesco.					2016-04-16T16:43:24+0000	1460825004	2016-04-16 18:43:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today we did our weekly tesco shop at tesco arena Coventry.At the entrance was a candy crush advertising team with two people dressed in shapes (faces Covered) when we entered one of the mascots were waving at our four year old daughter and she wanted to go back to see them at the end of our shopping trip.so as my partner was loading the shopping onto the belt I took my daughter to go and see the candy crush mascots.i stood a few steps back so she could go and say hello.she approached one and showed him/her the teddy she was holding.they took it from her hand and threw it across the floor I mean not just drop it but literally threw it  3 metres away! I m still in shock now that they have done this! A man and lady who were also there advertising saw the teddy on the floor and saw my daughter upset.they asked if it was my daughter or him that had thrown the teddy to which I replied him! They didn t apologise for having such an idiot of a colleague just shook there head.my 4 year old daughter came away upset which is quite understandable after this idiot of a person did this! All she wanted was a simple high five and hug but instead was face to face with a complete and utter imbecile.I m not one to make a scene but really wish I had now and got them to apologise face to face to my daughter.disgusting behaviour for anyone that is trying to sell a product to the public!  very unprofessional and obviously a child themselves thinking this is fun to do to a four year old little girl.					2016-04-16T15:55:00+0000	1460822100	2016-04-16 17:55:00	0	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I received an email from you on 14th saying item dispatched and will be delivered Fri 15th...but have not received item or any further emails saying otherwise...I have rang twice this morning selecting the  deliveries  option from Tesco direct and on both occasions put through to answerphone... No one has rang me back to deal with this and I think this is very unprofessional... My granddaughter was crying when I had to tell her the postman hadn t delivered it yet... I would like someone to contact me asap regarding this matter plz as I m not getting any responses from store or email.					2016-04-16T15:03:16+0000	1460818996	2016-04-16 17:03:16	0	17	0	0	17	17	7	10	18	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She did her shopping on scan as shop and got thru the tills before me as I had to use a checkout. She was waiting for me outside the shop sitting on the bench getting food out to feed her son. A few minutes later a security guard that goes by the name of munday approached her accusing her off stealing and told her she needed to get back in the store. She got up and went with him giving the security guard her receipt. He got all up in her face and was swearing at her she obviously told him to f#ck off and she called another security guard over which told this munday to go away which he refused kept antagonising the girl all of this in front of her son. She then called for a manager this point in tears. The security manager came named Brian was very rude to her she told him to check cctv and the nice security guard backed her up the manager then told  the nice security guard off in the cafe which we were moved into. I then tried to speak to this Brian to say I witnessed it and he said rubbish we asked to speak to store manager which he replied no chance and kicked us both out of the store. By this time my friend was on phone to police as the way the were treating her but because they didn t lay a hand on her is not a criminal offence for her to be treated this way and they didn t need to get involved because she had left the store and was no longer in fear. So if you want to be treated like that your sons  daughters  mums dad s  grandparents go shop in tesco riverfield drive Bedford.					2016-04-16T15:03:02+0000	1460818982	2016-04-16 17:03:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

All day I ve been trying to get my TV sorted.  On the 5th of September 2015 my dad purchased  me a Toshiba TV from the yeovil store. It was about 8 or 9 at night.he paid with cash and no clubcard as he man lol  Last night the thing broke. I was watching it when suddenly it broke the screen went from being pictured with sound to a TV all back with sound and power. Nothing I do buy checking  the obvious works.  I ve unplugged it put it back in the box. I ve contacted my store and customer service who are saying because I lost my receipt my warranty is not valid as I can t prove when I brought it.  When I tried explaining that over the ten years I shopped with tesco when I ve taken something back without a recipet before. They were only to happy to help exchange it. I even twice before had the amount gifted to a gift card without proof of a recipet.  When I said this I was basically called a lier. My 3 children s father who I m no longer with buys school uniform every year. He always buys the wrong size they always allow an exchange with no receipt as he keeps them.  Obviously because of the size of the TV it s clear it was brought and not stolen. I ve been told that the item has a garuntee with both yourself and Toshiba but nobody will help me because I lost the receipt please help tesco	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13012769_989820021054906_6269818050331542207_n.jpg?oh=94c6cfd757d78ae109979f90ca092dff&oe=59210182	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/13012769_989820021054906_6269818050331542207_n.jpg?oh=d9d017042affd4715bb7c7eb7e066a2e&oe=591BDD7D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=989820021054906&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-16T14:42:59+0000	1460817779	2016-04-16 16:42:59	0	17	0	0	17	17	9	8	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The store has been open less than 72 hours and already there are cigarette butts on top of bins and scattered over the floor. Worse still is that the smell and smoke drifts right past the disabled and parent and child spaces.					2016-04-16T14:34:46+0000	1460817286	2016-04-16 16:34:46	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I visited the petrol station today at 1pm and there was a young lad serving alone. Unfortunately I couldn t see a name badge. The gentleman in front of me was deaf and the young lad serving spoke to him in sign language. It really made this gentleman s day and was so lovely to see. He deserves some recognition for this outstanding customer service.					2016-04-16T12:50:01+0000	1460811001	2016-04-16 14:50:01	41	8	41	0	49	7	4	3	1	0	41	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked the lady on the checkout and she said you sold them. She asked another member of staff to find one for me & he said we were both mistaken and they had never sold them in that store. I came home empty handed & spoke to my friend who indeed had purchased one from there. I then went back with her several hours later and asked a different member of staff who located me one. Quite disheartened as  the member of staff clearly either didn t know your stock or couldn t be bothered to help/look for the product in question.					2016-04-16T10:58:25+0000	1460804305	2016-04-16 12:58:25	0	10	0	0	10	10	3	7	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As per usual whist I was selecting the soya milk of my choice near the cereal shelf an ignorant/thoughtless/senseless/ customer had placed a tub of Tesco s own brand of porridge only on the wrong shelf nearby. The staff are well aware of this attitude. It was my idea that all cashiers should have a box underneath the counter so that unwanted items can be placed back in their original position at the end of trading. This hasn t worked very well. At least if I see an item which is abandoned only yards away fom it s original position I put it back in it s position or hand it to a memer of staff. At lest I bought all my items without any problem and as not 1 but 3 customers behind me had only a few items in their basket compared to my 25 items.					2016-04-16T10:57:08+0000	1460804228	2016-04-16 12:57:08	0	16	0	0	16	12	5	7	12	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I only purchased this yesterday in tesco Cavan and to be honest would prob feel very foolish bringing it back in ... Do you have any suggestion?

First time I had ever been in the store.   I collect hotwheels cars so went to have a look what they had in a different store to my local. I spent about 2 mins browsing the toy section and the cars with no luck for what I was after.   Just as I was about to walk out the toy isle I got approached by a security guard and also a woman that looked like possibly the store manager.  Only to have them question me and make me look like some kind of shop lifter while everyone else in store was walking past looking.   I m 32 years old and I come in wearing a £120 jacket a pair of £80 jeans a £30 tshirt £150 glasses using my iPhone 6. I think I can afford a £1.50 hotwheels toy and should not have been treated and made to feel and look like a common crack head shoplifter.   I was appalled you need to keep a eye on the real shoplifters and not go accusing innocent people randomly in store!!					2016-04-16T06:29:54+0000	1460788194	2016-04-16 08:29:54	1	42	1	0	43	40	4	36	25	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Soo I took my NEW car through a Tesco car wash a couple weeks back because my son said he always wanted to go through one. After taking it through the car wash my paintwork was covered in scratches all over. I went into the store and filled out an insurance claim form and they were very apologetic and helpful. 10 days later I have found out  the results of there investigation through a letter and boy am I angry! In no uncertain terms they ve  told me it isn t their fault and there is nothing wrong with the car wash! I m so cross if I am ever to resell this car it has lost significant value and Tesco couldn t  care less  terrible customer service from a multi billion £ company. #boycotttesco	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12998720_10156760986155291_1481043807698905744_n.jpg?oh=da826ac66d92b4ae1cbd810c93a3ad26&oe=58D5D078	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12998720_10156760986155291_1481043807698905744_n.jpg?oh=106a763e94cd354d2516ff744ea470cf&oe=58D9D50C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156760986155291&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-15T18:32:07+0000	1460745127	2016-04-15 20:32:07	3	26	6	1	33	26	5	21	11	0	3	0	0	0	0	3	0

As I went towards the checkouts there was a commotion at the front of the store between the above and security and other Tesco workers. A man in front of me just abandoned his shopping and ran to the front chasing them out! He made sure they were fully off the premises and then calmly returned to do his shopping. Don t know who you were but you were a hero tonight and stopped a situation escalating! The little people had tried to escape with bottles of booze. Well done that man!					2016-04-15T18:18:51+0000	1460744331	2016-04-15 20:18:51	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A Tesco delivery drivers smashes into our parked van  yet you refuse to pay the repair bill. That van is our livelihood  not only have we incurred a huge loss over the last ten days to our small business  but now have a van with damage  which is now less of an asset to us if we sold it  also unsure as to how long it will be roadworthy for due to the door damage. Absolute disgrace  I am just grateful there weren t children playing sat the time  the van driver was speeding down a small street  to cause so much damage to a parked vehicle what could he have done to a couple of small children.

I m from Oxfordshire and my local store is in Bicester! The past few weeks I ve been travelling to the store on a Sunday to purchase my favourite nuts (salt and black pepper cashews) so I can enjoy them while I watch the football but I ve been bitterly disappointed. Understandable because you guys are changing stores!  Anyway. Today  I ve finished work early (cheeky half day on a Friday) so I thought I d travel to my new local store that opened yesterday! I was excited to see what you guys had to offer! And what a superb job you guys have done. Pat yourselves on the back you deserve it!!  But  my trip to tesco today has turned into a tragic and distraught experience for me (and my girlfriend who I ve been venting my anger and disappointment to for the past half hour). I think by now you know what s coming...  So  I walk down the aisle where various crisps  nuts and other snacky items were. I find myself staring into what I can only describe as  nut hell  trying to locate the salt and black pepper cashews  that were the soul purpose of the trip. Nothing! Couldn t find them anywhere! Can you understand why I m so distraught?  Could you please shed some light on this please! I ve been forced to by normal salted cashews. It s not on tesco!

Left my bank card in tescos not even 24hrs ago & it s now been destroyed. Phoned them confirming it was there not long after I left  & told them I would be in first thing today before work for it they said thatl be fine  it will be there. It took 5 different people in total to help today  some telling me a load of rubbish about not been able to get it until later as it would set of an alarm. Half an hour later I get told it s at the police station  they keep some lost cards but not all. 30 minutes to check for a card! Went to the police station to find out it has been destroyed. Such a joke! Left with no bank card now because tesco seem like they don t have any proper processes in order for these kind of things. A simple message isn t even passed on to the store to ensure it is still there for me. Did not expect this to happen with a massive business chain like this.					2016-04-15T16:07:56+0000	1460736476	2016-04-15 18:07:56	9	10	9	0	19	10	5	5	13	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tried to use one today and was told very abruptly that you don t take them any more  the same coupons that the website Supersavvyme give out for P&G brands.  First the woman wandered off  she could see I was exhausted (I m disabled) she inspected the coupon a dozen times  asked her friend who was obviously a fountain of knowledge who boomed out with WE VE NEVVAA TEKKEN THEM KOOPONS  well  yes you have  because I ve used them several times before without any problem  do you really think I m trying to scam your supermarket out of a 90p pouch of cat food?     This was today in the Tesco Extra store in St Helens at 2.45pm.  It s not just the fact that it took her so long  it s the embarrassment to go with it and ends up making using the scan and shop completely pointless because I could have gone through a normal checkout in the time it took her to faff about.  Very unhappy and starting to understand why you re losing market share  SafeCoupons are the leading provider of Internet printable coupons.					2016-04-15T15:08:48+0000	1460732928	2016-04-15 17:08:48	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had to decline on principal.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/12720122_994915460601603_686613305_n.jpg?oh=2aecfb0bc8fc7ef20b28332eab83d824&oe=590CB96E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/12720122_994915460601603_686613305_n.jpg?oh=de059bd329db2029220d9f87ca68dc72&oe=5909807A	https://www.facebook.com/838495492910268/videos/994915103934972	facebook.com	2016-04-15T14:46:12+0000	1460731572	2016-04-15 16:46:12	2	10	3	3	16	10	7	3	10	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0

I take a size 4 shoe and as all other shops you only sell one size for women.  One size does NOT  fit all. They curl up at my toes and give me blisters. My friend who is a size 7 says the heel works its way under her feet. I notice that ypu have better sizing for men. This is blatant sexual discrimination.					2016-04-15T14:40:49+0000	1460731249	2016-04-15 16:40:49	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I fancied some chocolate so headed towards the confectionary isle. standing deciding what to choose  i was very aware of the strong chemical smell. i turned around........on the same isle you have weed killer/plant food and lots of other gardening stuff. i was  put off buying anything that was stored near this. WHY?! i asked an assistant  the lady agreed it was not a good idea and said that it was probably there as it was the seasonal isle......... Sorry  if i asked people 10 out of 10 would agree that chocolate/sweets is definatly NOT seasonal.					2016-04-15T13:53:02+0000	1460728382	2016-04-15 15:53:02	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However when you go to pay in the Kiosk to pay it is £10:01. Was informed that the pump works to 2 decimal places but the till does it to 3 decimal places. Since then I have been using other Garages and have never had the same situation. Anybody else noticed the odd penny added on once in a while? And from my experience how come only at Tesco s?					2016-04-15T12:55:21+0000	1460724921	2016-04-15 14:55:21	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s absolutely ridiculous  you should be ashamed that you cannot seem to get this right  it s been months and months of phone calls and emails  yet still you cannot deliver ACROSS the road! In the future if you do finally decide your team can actually cross the road you may find that you won t actually have any customers to deliver to. There are many homes on this side of the road you don t deliver to and you probably never will because we will not require your services due to lack of customer care and lack of competency from yourselves to make this change. It s a shame no one seems to have the ability or authority to make this possible  it s ridiculous!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12974360_1079316498793198_5617723510389470810_n.jpg?oh=bb18273240ff31e5a9b27cb2c1d00e46&oe=5922A831	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12974360_1079316498793198_5617723510389470810_n.jpg?oh=c9a0a17979a9b2e6ff65d4bf60d1ae78&oe=58D65924	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1079316498793198&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-15T12:11:49+0000	1460722309	2016-04-15 14:11:49	2	17	5	0	22	11	5	6	1	0	2	0	0	3	0	0	0

Now can I ask that you take that dairy free ice cream & put it into a tub? My gf & I can t have dairy & we do miss ice cream  so it would be nice to have this available. I know you sell Swedish Glace dairy free ice cream but that s about all there is for us. Would be great to have a bit more choice.

Whilst shopping my nan slipped and fell on spilt bubble bath that was unfortunately not visible as it was white/almost clear that had not been cleaned up. She was in a lot of pain with her back and wrist so the following day she visited the local A&E to be told she has broken her wrist and had bad bruising on her back. After returning to the store to speak to a manager to let them know of the extent of her injuries she was told a manager would contact her. She has still heard nothing! I do not think this is acceptable! Surely the store should have logged this incident? My Nan is also a diabetic so has to be careful of painkillers she takes as they effect her blood sugar and tablets. So she has got to be in a lot of pain for the next 6/7 weeks with a cast on her right arm  which is the hand she writes with!					2016-04-15T10:22:14+0000	1460715734	2016-04-15 12:22:14	1	4	1	2	7	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is the second time I am sending you a complaint this week!  I was given the baby grow pictured here for my baby shower at the end of last August. My son is now big enough to be put in it but when I did  I couldn t work out why the poppers were busting at the seams on his left leg. I assumed I had left it too long and that actually he was now too big for it - although his right leg was fine. Maybe I have a wonky son?? Nope! I laid it out on the bed and it became apparent that the left leg is about 2cm shorter than the right one!! How can this happen??	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13015386_10157477184970377_6092530537277419278_n.jpg?oh=cee79c060aefbd90188b126922fba09a&oe=58D74CF8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13015386_10157477184970377_6092530537277419278_n.jpg?oh=143ccfd9ca307c3e478a6f8e54a1ab7d&oe=58DBC8F5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157477184970377&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-15T09:50:09+0000	1460713809	2016-04-15 11:50:09	2	12	2	0	14	12	7	5	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Aren t girls allowed to like superheros.  Why are all the girls clothing in your new spring catalog wither flora print  pastel or otherwise not look as rugged and hard wearing as the boys stuff and why is all the boys stuff drab boring colours or superhero themed?  Kids like colours  parents like stuff that stands up to rugged  messy  run about in the grass/sand/dirt play.  The girls stuff all looks like the kind of stuff you d want to be kept clean and nice  not very conducive to play.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12987146_10154084638442604_2187980358063959784_n.jpg?oh=25bb60cf54619b784e8ea4398e770006&oe=59172EC5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12987146_10154084638442604_2187980358063959784_n.jpg?oh=a5381a3997998c4b96299e1c89b36db6&oe=58D9CDC8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154084638442604&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-15T09:14:42+0000	1460711682	2016-04-15 11:14:42	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On page 32 you feature the Graco  Milestone  car seat and state that it rear faces to 18kg  this is incorrect as the seat only rear faces to 13kg same as a group 0+ infant carrier. You also have an error in the information on the minimum weight for it to be used as a booster seat  legally this is 15kg not 13kg as you state. It is always safer to wait until the child is 18kg and exceeds the weight for the harness on these seats however. I have heard of a number of people being given misleading information on this seat and you certainly aren t helping with this kind of incorrect information ☹️					2016-04-15T08:37:01+0000	1460709421	2016-04-15 10:37:01	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m astounded and disgusted to see that you waste so much food  just from the bakery department  seemingly on a daily basis. This was approximately 2030 and the store is open for a further 3 and a half hours but you just throw it away? You don t even reduce anything in a bid for it to be sold and not wasted. Here is FIVE full bags with an assistant out of shot filling further bags. Why on earth are you even baking this much when obviously there is not the demand to sell that amount!? There was a mixture of loaves  French sticks  cobs  croissants and other items. For a big company I understand the cost is probably minimal to you but that is not the point. Morally it is wrong to overproduce these items to just throw them away. In recent times you ve actually lost money and it s no wonder if this reflects the practises of all your stores. I believe Derbyshire is actually opening another food bank and instead of simply throwing good food away  can t you at least put it to good use by donating it to food banks etc? Ideally I d like you to review what you sell and you ll see there is obviously not the demand for the amount you bake. I m absolutely appalled that this is going on.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12961485_10153581157977776_8514696002724911431_n.jpg?oh=e70312a2796ceb3007456be2ffad7da1&oe=591E92ED	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12961485_10153581157977776_8514696002724911431_n.jpg?oh=e18bde2d2259bf92d3340bd0b96ee9b0&oe=590E18E0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153581157977776&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-15T08:02:39+0000	1460707359	2016-04-15 10:02:39	0	9	0	0	9	9	1	8	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Generally speaking your till colleagues are very polite and friendly. But this morning the lady that served me took extra time to help me fix my bag. I know that you have targets to hit for the amount of people and the pace at which people go through the tills. Please ensure this lady isn t penalised in anyway for stopping to help me. I didn t get her name but what probably felt like a small gesture to her fixing some thread on my bag has restored my faith in humanity. And as you have just reported a profit maybe you could give her a little bonus for outstanding customer service.					2016-04-15T07:58:13+0000	1460707093	2016-04-15 09:58:13	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Show him the three empty spaces on the shelf where the Coffee  Quaker Oats and Ginsters Pastys should be and ask him how he expects to make any money.

However I have noticed that a handy feature of the website has been removed. I used to be able to see all my vouchers and ecoupons and just tick a box to use them with a shop. Now it asks me to type out the voucher numbers I wish to use. Please reconsider removing this handy feature. Half the time I forget I ve got vouchers and by the time I do remember they have expired. It really would be great if you could put the tick boxes back!					2016-04-15T07:47:35+0000	1460706455	2016-04-15 09:47:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They ve cooked a ray of foods  from easy fruit kebabs to scrummy salmon pilaf. Have taken part in new roles such as chopping with knives  whilst using safety methods (fork secure and bridge) learning about and using a good selection of ingredients. Tasting new and old favourites  and rediscovering a love for cooking. Scones and making flatbread a firm favourite. A massive thank you for the opportunity  and to Andrea and Kate your Gorton Team of ladies  our girls have had a ball 😄 xx	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/13001182_10154088661962370_5952926069623965094_n.jpg?oh=695989f0492f40cbf566c6bade4fa142&oe=58D70EEE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/13001182_10154088661962370_5952926069623965094_n.jpg?oh=260e54b3bac5dab39e1a9256b395eba8&oe=58DA42E3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154088661962370&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-14T18:35:46+0000	1460658946	2016-04-14 20:35:46	14	2	15	0	17	2	1	1	1	0	14	1	0	0	0	0	0

The cashier took the security tag off (very good of them). This evening as I ve got to put the pj s on my daughter she s picked them up put a leg in and felt the security pin still in the back of the pj s! !!!!! Surely common sense (tho I know a lot of people lack this) would if removing a security tag would know they would still need to remove the pin from the garment as well! I can not explain how angry I am at this. Last week I had to return an item because a tag was left on and then when removed by your customer service it had left a massive hole because someone (again common sense) had decided the best best place to tag such clothing is through the middle of the back!!!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12974286_856542321138632_1400389468448104419_n.jpg?oh=debd1b2384a7235c14853ffd8b70ac77&oe=59108C78	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12974286_856542321138632_1400389468448104419_n.jpg?oh=e01a69f3b0292f31706b7848986a2e60&oe=590B3F87	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=856542321138632&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-14T18:03:49+0000	1460657029	2016-04-14 20:03:49	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just tonight I have found 10% of the packet is faulty. I have included a picture of the faulty nappies. I m sure if I had this many in one packet then I m probably not alone  so just a heads up about this  such a shame as have previously (in 7 years using your own brand nappies) had a problem :-(					2016-04-14T17:20:56+0000	1460654456	2016-04-14 19:20:56	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My little girl had a mini meltdown before coming down on the escalator earlier today. She was absolutely fine going up it  but when it came to going down it she just froze and wouldn t go down.  A lady staff member came up to us (really sorry I didn t get her name) and asked if my little girl wanted to hold her hand while she went down it. My little girl held her hand and was laughing all way down. Just a small act of kindness which helped my little one overcome her fear 😘💗 xxxxx					2016-04-14T17:07:17+0000	1460653637	2016-04-14 19:07:17	185	29	191	20	240	27	19	8	12	0	184	6	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my partner have just had our first child who is only 4 days old  we booked a delivery for this morning as we went quite up to the task of shopping yet.   The delivery arrived not long after 9 am this morning  me and my partner were still in our night wear just coming around from another sleepless night and the coffee hadn t quite kicked in yet. We were greeted my 2 very friendly gentleman  we apologised that we looked like daft and said why  they both congratulated us and helped us with our shopping and then congratulated us both again before they left.   Then this afternoon we had a knock at the door and I saw another tesco van   what have they forgot I thought   I was greeted by another gentleman who said they  had heard we d just had our first child and they wanted to send us a present   he present me with a lively bunch of flowers  a card and a Pegga the pig stuffed toy  both me and my partner were quite shocked and overwhelmed how nice and thoughtful this was.   So all 3 of us just want to say a massive thank you  we really appreciate the kindness and thoughtfulness of your staff  please pass out thanks onto all 3 of them.					2016-04-14T16:52:16+0000	1460652736	2016-04-14 18:52:16	14	2	14	1	17	2	2	0	4	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

I love these apples but if they are like this I won t be buying again at £2 a bag!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p130x130/12988051_1002975319740137_1044559573_n.jpg?oh=dd73a0d7e88c8a44dc627b6c1c0cdfca&oe=58804AA5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/p720x720/12988051_1002975319740137_1044559573_n.jpg?oh=3928992ff893f9edd2acab001a0d369e&oe=5880296E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1002977866406549&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-14T16:14:34+0000	1460650474	2016-04-14 18:14:34	4	2	4	0	6	2	2	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

In particular the pistachio nuts that tasted better than Tesco branded but so much cheaper. The shelves were always nearly empty every time i visited. Every time i visit now the shelves are full of Tesco brand because nobody buys them !! Clearly this should tell you something. Either bring the non branded ones back or reduce your ridiculous prices.					2016-04-14T16:00:39+0000	1460649639	2016-04-14 18:00:39	0	9	0	0	9	9	1	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Its gradually been getting more watery with each batch  but this last tub could have been sold in a bottle!  To add insult to injury I see its now produced in Denmark from German and Danish milk. Not to mention  lots of water.  Don t you care about British dairy farmers - not only are you content to sacrifice livelihoods  but now it seems  quality too.					2016-04-14T15:34:54+0000	1460648094	2016-04-14 17:34:54	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can t praise Peter from Port Glasgow store enough  he was really helpful & informative  went through my receipt & informed me of how the brand match works. I have three little boys under the age of four  & Peter offered to put the shopping bags in my kitchen for me which I really appreciated.

So I call again and they ve just cancelled it. I had my phone on me the whole day and received many calls from people prior to my delivery slot AND called you so the phone was working perfectly fine and I have good service in my house. A day later shopping still not here  no email  maybe even a text  all i get is sorry you ll get your refund. If the call wouldn t go through why not try texting or other ways to get in contact.

I notice the alternative tesco brand is not selling as well. My little boy is autistic & has a very limited diet. The cafe continental Tesco brand were the ones he took in his lunch box to school & to snack on while we were out. He s off to playscheme with bread to make toast today! I have tried just about every other brand I can find  but none match the cafe continental brand. I have messaged you previously & hope you will restock these again soon.					2016-04-14T07:41:49+0000	1460619709	2016-04-14 09:41:49	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have had to drive around using all of my petrol to find somewhere else and I didn t need to! I ve been so pleased with tesco here since day one but  recently they re letting slip - one minute having a box full of fruit for kids to have one of and then when my kids get used to it  it s taken away - myself and my wife when using the CONVENIENT scanners while we shop have a RANDOM security check EVERYTIME we enter the store and now the pure inconvenience of this! Since moving here I have spent between £150 and £200 at your store a week and I am so angry right now I have a good mind to take my custom over the road to morrisons! I suggest the staff there aren t trained properly  lazy or just full of crap but  I am not happy. I will be calling the tesco customer service first thing in the morning with my complaint and telling them about the awful service I ve had the last week!

I don t have my receipt and I did pay cash on the 11th as my total was £3 for my shopping.

I went to your store in Woolwich on the way to visit my baby in hospital to buy the poorly naked baby some tiny clothes... your store sucked... badly... your sale Rail was like a boot sale. No tags items with things missing. But I needed the clothes so I choose some and took about 25 pounds worth to the till .. even willing to buy a set with bits missing cos I needed the tiny clothes... now not one person could help me when I tried to put things though the till. No one could leave anywhere no one know why you had a rail full of tagless items. I was spending longer and longer missing time with my baby while your unhelpfull stuff stood in their ordered areas and all told me they could not leave to help me. I wanted to buy these clothes I stood and my friend ran about trying to get some help. NOT ONE MEMBER of your staff knew what to do. In the end we had to leave the clothes at the till and just walk out as I was getting to the point where I wanted to shout about how crappy your customer service was and you clearly was not bothered about selling items so I left about 25 pounds worth of clothes and left with nothing. So my poor naked baby still has no tiny clothes your store still sucks and seeing it s one of the only places I can buy tiny clothes other then online it was extremely disappointing.  I would like someone to get in touch with me about how your having trouble selling items and which store would be best for me to walk into pick my clothes pay and walk out instead of waiting about for half an hour while your staff have a blank look on their face like they could not understand I was wanting to buy something... it made my day very annoying and my visit to my baby very sad as I wanted to dress her in outfits I had bought her... it may seem minor to you. But the whole experience was bloody shocking for a store like yours and really puts me of going back.					2016-04-13T20:02:55+0000	1460577775	2016-04-13 22:02:55	1	4	1	0	5	4	4	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The polythene bags on the loaves of bread frequently break and so my mum put a couple of the fruit and veg bags around the loaf  as she has done for at least the last 30 years. When she got to the checkout she was told by the snooty woman who was serving that technically she should charge my mum 10p for the bags! Well if that s the case you should put a sign by the bags in the fruit and veg section notifying people of this and in addition to this put the loaves of bread in polythene bags that don t split in the first place! We don t want other people s hands on our bread! The checkout woman s attitude was awful and if it had been me I would have told the woman where to stick the bread! So I would like you to explain this situation and also tell your checkout staff that they re not there to make up their own rules!					2016-04-13T19:59:29+0000	1460577569	2016-04-13 21:59:29	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

You are concerned about maintaining comparability of senior staff remuneration with other similar companies  but if ALL companies put forward the same argument  then it maintains an artificially high level of expectation. Why not be bold and radical and set a lower rate of pay for senior staff  so you can pay a proper wage to the people who work for you on the less well paid levels.

This scared me a lot so much so when I reported it to tesco the gave me a full refund and arranged for a courier to collect it the next day. Obviously I want to make people aware of this as there may have been a fault on the product and would hate for it to happen to someone else  so I left a review on their website (see below picture) however today I receive an email from tesco to say my review will not be published as doesn t meet All their website guidelines?!

I spent the day working very hard and thought I d treat myself to some of your delicious hot wings from the deli counter. These are my favourite I eat some every day  not sure that anything food wise can beat them - well maybe an ice cream on a hot day. But I don t want to be fat and we all know how bad our weather is. I genuinely buy some everyday and look forward to it  it s one of my highlights. So I walked to the Spring Hill Road Tesco in Birmingham  it s in Hockley right next to the Welcome to North West Birmingham sign arrived to your store my mouth was salivating at the thought of getting my hands on one of those warm zip up bags of hot chicken wings and headed I marched straight to the Deli counter. I got there and couldn t see the wings heart racing I was outraged ready to blow  then the assistant noticed me and asked looking for wings  I nodded - he pointed to the side they was there. Phew. So I picked them up carried on with my shopping and went home to make my snack. Sat down enjoying my food  when suddenly I noticed my wing had a feather on it. This is quite frankly disgusting and has put me off my lunch - not only that but I m not sure I m ever going to be able to happily exchange money for these wings again. I have purchased these for years and have never seen a sign of feathers  and am so disappointed about this. I just know if I pay for some wings and see a feather my life would be figuratively over - like potentially it s better to remember the good times we shared. Gutted that the relationship we shared is over now.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/11140203_1019417524778164_3488918185766757057_n.jpg?oh=7fc2f0205931461716a06b0875010bbf&oe=5923867D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11140203_1019417524778164_3488918185766757057_n.jpg?oh=8d97bf00b2fdcd4555a9678c702ac8b1&oe=590FF468	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1019417524778164&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-13T16:00:34+0000	1460563234	2016-04-13 18:00:34	19	45	24	6	75	43	22	21	88	0	18	0	0	4	0	0	0

I witnessed such an event today  Tesco Penicuik duty manager refused to  make a customer store announcement  What is the point!!!! Makes me so upset  especially on a miserable day like today  seeing parents struggling to get a baby out of their car seat  with minimal door space  in the pouring rain.

On Police advisement I ordered some CCTV cameras with built in microphones on 31.3.16. I paid for  Express Delivery  and paid £115 for the cameras & hard-drive.  A week later  no cameras  your CS refunded my delivery charge and the cameras eventually arrived on 8.4.16. They have now been installed.  So now we ve discovered that the cameras do NOT have a built in microphone at all. This must be contrary to the Sales of Goods Act.  Having spoken to your CS team I was directed to Appliances Direct who asked me to complete a  returns  form. I Do Not Want To Return Them! They have been installed on my property! I want the microphones I thought I was paying for.  To add insult to injury the cameras are now for sale £10 cheaper on your website and STILL advertising a  built in microphone .					2016-04-13T12:15:26+0000	1460549726	2016-04-13 14:15:26	0	15	0	0	15	15	5	10	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Blood curdling crunch  .... The full of tesco came to a complete stand still  and every one  myself included were in slow motion ..... My son had completely knocked himself unconscious  in my panic  of course my instinct was to lift him and cuddle him  he came round and was violently sick twice  while all the time the staff were amazing  and never once made me feel stressed or panic  there kindness and empathy  was exactly what I needed to keep myself calm and also him ... Of course ambulance was phoned and there within minutes  and again the lady seen to that  with minimal distraction  while I could attend to my quite poorly son  all in all  prob was only 15/20 from the time of the accident till we were blue lighted to the hospital  unfortunately with all the rush  of course  I never got the ladies names  but I can assure you I will find out and thank these ladies myself and go into the store  so again a massive thank you to your store and these fabby ladies 😘😘					2016-04-13T12:03:23+0000	1460549003	2016-04-13 14:03:23	1051	74	1065	56	1195	72	53	19	148	0	1038	11	3	0	0	0	0

I only realised this when I went to purchase my sons birthday present today for tomorrow. I rang my bank and they said the normal 98 has gone out and there s another 98 pending  which has sent me over drawn with no money in my bank account. So I rang head office and stupidly thought it would get sorted ASAP . I had an apology and was told I will have to wait 3/4 days to get the money back! I explained my bank had charged me 25 pound for something that wasn t my fault   and I now have no money for my sons birthday and all the lady said was she will give me a 5 pound good will voucher!!! Now I can t be the only one who thinks this is a absolute disgrace!!  It s bad enough I have to pay the overdraft but Who is going to explain this to a 4 year old with no birthday presents ?? I m truly shocked that such a big company can get away with treating people like this !!!!! No wonder they made such a good profit!!! Stealing people s money !!!! Like I said I use tesco every week for food and petrol  I am truly angry and upset with the whole experience !!!!!! I would appreciate some one getting in touch with me as 5 pound good will voucher is an absolute joke					2016-04-13T11:49:33+0000	1460548173	2016-04-13 13:49:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was laying on the floor outside and refusing to leave because he wanted to go in for some reason.  The member of staff invited him to look around and even found a biscuit for him.  I was able to leave the shop with a happy child rather than have to carry him away screaming.					2016-04-13T11:46:09+0000	1460547969	2016-04-13 13:46:09	5	3	5	0	8	3	1	2	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

You were very rude upon entering their home I witnessed as I was there with my partner and one year old daughter. It has since come to my attention that when you left you saw fit to take your concerns to the staff room where a friend of ours actually works as a delivery driver too (small world ey?). So let me clear up a few things for you...   The reason it says on our notes at home that we would like the shopping delivered to the kitchen and not the front door is because my Nana is disabled (not my Grandad who answered the door and had  nothing wrong with him ) although my Grandad did actually have a stroke the year before last. Which was actually a horrible experience  we nearly lost him and his left arm doesn t work anymore. He still gets our names confused sometimes and his memory isn t what it was. I digress  my Nana has a blue badge due to her countless illnesses  she has diabetes and nerve damage to her feet which leaves her in constant pain. She stays in bed most days and has to use a wheelchair when she does go out as she has crippling arthritis. This is the least of her worries really as the nerve damage in her back and neck has left her with two major surgeries  constant pain and damage to her voice box. So I m sorry you had to walk our shopping into the kitchen rather than the door  is that disabled enough for you?  My partner actually tried to help but when you barged through and nearly nocked over my Nana and daughter he thought it best to keep them out of the way. I don t know if you ve ever looked after a one year old but you are welcome to come and test it out of you think it constitutes as  sweet F A .   I hope this clears some issues up for you.

Luckily I didn t realise you could get one for me which was great . Unfortunately after you got me a trolley and the staff member disappeared   I realised for the second time visiting the harness strap was broken .The first time I thought ok maby it was just the one off so I just took the trolley to customer services   but today I was shocked to be given another one that was broken. I think this is a big health and safety issue.I then gave in after I couldn t find anyone and headed to the toy isle and let my daughter pick a peppa pig toy to keep her focused from jumping out as a times she starting to think she s Indiana Jones . My question to you is 1. Why don t you have a sign explaining that mothers and fathers can ask a member of staff for a trolley or go like morrisons and take away the pound for a trolley ?2.Do your staff not regularly check the safety of each trolley ?

I went to make my 11 month old his breakfast (rusks with cold milk) and as I lifted the bowl it started to drip then I noticed the hole in the bottom and bits of plastic all in his breakfast. If I hadn t of lifted the bowl I would of been feeding my son plastic. This is the second time I ve used the bowl and only been washed in the sink. Can see why it was only £1 now.

I went to customer services and they called for a non food member of staff to come down  no one came... they called again and still no one came. The lady behind the till then went to get the laptop for me and 15 minutes later she finally returned  with the wrong laptop.  I left the store disappointed and called Great Notley store (I saw them on display in here) who said they had some in stock  great i thought! I went to this store straight to customer services  the manager went to find the laptop for me and after 10 minutes he came back and said they didn t have the colour I wanted  I said gold would be fine instead  he went back to get this for me and when he finally returned  he had also got the wrong laptop! I cannot understand why your stores are advertising a product that you do not even sell? I have since looked online and it says the product is unavailable in any store... so why is it still being displayed?

It was going to happen at some point so you may as well come clean...  When it comes to marketing  its a well known fact that adding a whole thesaurus worth of descriptions to food  gives it a greater interpreted value. For example a packet of 18 month cave matured vintage cheddar cheese from say the  Simply amazing cheese company  can be sold for considerably more that one labelled  Value Cheddar .  M&S pioneered this trend with those adverts  you know the ones. But other companies do it too. You have your Finest range for example. Now for the most part this is no bother to me. I know my place and where as the finest range may be reserved for flash city types and people who bank in Panama  the likes of me makes do with the standard product range.  So imagine my disappointment with you Tesco when I spotted this little marketing ploy last week.  One the left we have 4 breaded cod fillets for £2 (Very reasonable). And on the right we have 4 CHUNKY breaded cod fillets for £3.   Now I thought  makes sense  the latter one is a bigger portion. Would make sense given the use of the word chunky. And the fact that it takes longer to cook. But no  no these products are the same weight! 500g.   Essentially these products are identical. Same fish (Cod)  same casing of breadcrumbs  same weight even the same packaging with the exception that you have written Chunky on one. Now paying more for well marketed food is one thing  but to charge £1 for the word chunky is too far Tesco. That is a mark up of 50% all of which I assumes goes to the marketing teams retirement fund.  Quite what does make them chunky then Tesco? Granted in the photos on the box one looks a bit taller than the other  but if they are the same weight surely that means its going to be shorter to make up for it! Here is an idea  why not stand one of the regular fish portions on end in the photo  and market it as  Super Chunky  you could charge £4 then if the current mark up trend continues.  I look forward to hearing from you.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12961592_10208629259541369_4955912846284209174_n.jpg?oh=b02ccea65342dea894c396632d5cb46b&oe=58DB99D5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12961592_10208629259541369_4955912846284209174_n.jpg?oh=5d4fee10baa97da8751f37cfc5be059f&oe=59124FD8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208629259541369&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-13T08:26:35+0000	1460535995	2016-04-13 10:26:35	3	6	3	0	9	5	4	1	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

The other girl just blanked me. As it was just before 10:50 I was surprised at that as there has never been an issue before. It looks like he was reluctantly going to let me in with a roll of the eyes but I advised him to not bother. Sainsburys 3 doors down were happy to stay open until their advertised time and were also happy to accept.my money. Another customer lost.. it s no wonder the company is in the state that it is in.					2016-04-12T22:01:22+0000	1460498482	2016-04-13 00:01:22	4	17	4	1	22	17	3	14	5	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst cooking dinner this evening I opened a pack of your microwave long grain rice to find out the whole pack was black and mouldy. The stench was unbelievable  the rice is in date for another year... Thank god we opened it and found out sooner rather than later! Luckily I opened the packet before cooking it aswell!

Not only were the changes not mentioned on the packaging but my correspondence via private message with one of your customer services advisors gave me a generic response about sizes of nappies and how to put nappies on correctly as opposed to acknowledging the issues. I would be interested to know if the feedback is being passed to your buying department - if not I m sure they ll figure out that something s wrong when they review the sales figures. I will not be buying your nappies again.					2016-04-12T19:11:13+0000	1460488273	2016-04-12 21:11:13	4	13	4	0	17	13	5	8	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought this isn t right. I then carried on trying to shake all the lumps out. I then checked the date which was OCTOBER 2015!!

I have bought two pairs of jeans this past 8 months and both have badly put together to the point this happens to the material!  I do not wear them everyday and I d expect them to last longer when worn once or twice a week! I have jeans that are 3 years old and still look brand new!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12963884_10156866942075217_2219204202424682307_n.jpg?oh=6c186d5fa1352443336e35015f962142&oe=591AAD65	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12963884_10156866942075217_2219204202424682307_n.jpg?oh=27c764afa47b245b429b5cdf2e5be0d7&oe=59126668	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156866942075217&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-12T18:51:09+0000	1460487069	2016-04-12 20:51:09	1	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

So i had to drive to your alloa store to get it. If the duty manager was too lazy to go get it i would rather he just say so instead of telling me a lie.

We are very observant when this occurs . Yet unless staff aren t informed about it to rectify (which I do all the time) many other customers will complain and get overcharged.

I came across you re slow cooked beef brisket in gravy and thought that would be great for dinner for both me and my partner.  I got home and unpacked my shopping and decided to prepare dinner  I got the brisket out the packaging and was disappointed to find a very small portion of beef.  The packaging says serves 2 but it wasn t adequate for just my boyfriend. I ve attached a photo with my car key to show you the size of the meat.

When I arrived it was a frantic atmosphere  I was soon told by one of the assistants that yesterday their manager took ill and had to have his/her appendix removed  (I didn t catch if it was a man or woman)  so that explained the rush. The lady who arranged my appointment who was truly wonderful  a credit to your store  squashed me in that afternoon and took a pre test straight away so it was even quicker for me. When I returned the same lady greeted me  she talked me through the different frames you offer and again she was great. Then the optician called me through  from the moment I sat down he did not seem to have the time of day for me  I explained what I needed my glasses for and how I had been having migranes recently  but I furthur explained how I had been working a lot more and tried to make light of things with little jokes  which were not well recieved. During the appointment he was very rushed and seemed to be accusing me of faking eye-sight problems. He was changing lens  asking me if I could see a difference when I was answering honestlty he kept asking me if I was sure  and then the icing on his rude cake he said the line a health professional should never say   Are you sure  because we all love to say yes.  Overall he made me feel as though he did not have time for me  he did not want to help me  and he did not belive that I needed my glasses  (which I have been recieving on prescription from Tesco for 4 years). Sadly he was not wearing a name badge  lucky for him as I would most certainly name drop. I bought my glasses as I was in a rush  but I will not be visiting your opticians again.					2016-04-12T18:06:50+0000	1460484410	2016-04-12 20:06:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m afraid one of your hardware products is not fit for purpose . See attached . I bought these 2  pink jars at Hatfield store this morning . When I washed them before use the pink colour came away like a plastic film   in normal  washing up liquid water . I think these products are dangerous as the plastic type covering could fall into cereals or similar and hence be digested or worse . I will return  them to Hatfield tomorrow but my advice is to remove them from sale.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13015536_1316988694996840_7723208593888664446_n.jpg?oh=91c9113ba8f9a012d51822227992d955&oe=5913658F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/13015536_1316988694996840_7723208593888664446_n.jpg?oh=bc1dc19021cfe5c0d63ee43ae98ed27b&oe=59218DF3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1316988694996840&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-12T17:56:13+0000	1460483773	2016-04-12 19:56:13	5	21	5	0	26	21	5	16	3	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Did you know for 1kg of potato salad (at £11.89) you could purchase:  lunch at a nice restaurant or a months phone bill or actually  you could purchase 10kg of potatos and 2 kg of mayonnaise and create about 12 KILOGRAMS of your own potato salad.   Thought this price was a misprint  rang the store to check  since i hadn t noticed until i got home. Store confirmed that it was the correct price. Tesco  what are you playing at? There s no way your potato salad is worth a hike of 1200% from the cost of initial resources  especially when it doesn t even taste that great.

I had a delivery booked for this morning but unfortunately had to make an emergency doctors appointment that meant we missed the delivery. I was pretty stressed about the situation but the driver was so calm and helpful when he called to see where we were and really put my mind at ease.  Called the customer care team when I got home to see what to do next and they again were very helpful and re arranged the delivery for this afternoon.  Same delivery driver delivered the shopping this afternoon and was so kind and nice!  Really impressed with the level of professionalism and service from both the driver and customer care team.

After putting them on my son a few times I noticed they were a lot smaller then all his other 3-6month clothes. When I have had a closer look at these joggers  I have now noticed that the two different labels on this item show completely different sizes.. Can anyone explain this? So I have been sold a product that claims to be uk size 3-6months on one label  yet the other label states the uk size is up to 3 months.  Surely if this product is 3-6 months  the other label should state up to 6 months. This does not make any sense  they are clearly not the correct size. I am disappointed to say the least  again I have wasted money on a product I have been miss sold!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12963475_10154870007104569_3295320192039286262_n.jpg?oh=5c92da5836a358a7b0984b317518259d&oe=58DCC772	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12963475_10154870007104569_3295320192039286262_n.jpg?oh=f04c7d053b0e0a72abb95b3b8decd244&oe=5911157F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154870007104569&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-12T14:45:40+0000	1460472340	2016-04-12 16:45:40	3	9	3	0	12	9	3	6	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve just bought a new supply of 850  and they don t dissolve well at all. I stir my coffee for longer than I used to  to try to get them to dissolve  and still a semi-dissolved one pops up to the surface  so if I m not watchful I end up with a mouthful of very strong  semi-dissolved sweetener  and it s not very pleasant! I still have a few of the older ones in a travel dispenser  and they are fine  so it must be the new batch.					2016-04-12T13:37:12+0000	1460468232	2016-04-12 15:37:12	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the entire 10 years I have shopped at this branch not once has it been communicated that there is a maximum stay. This is a serious oversight on your part.  Your letter says that you have  overlooked  the first instance of my parking infringement  due to my being a  valued customer .  I can tell you now  that I do not in any way feel like a valued customer.  A valued customer would have been communicated with on the first infringement so that they would be aware of their error.  If you would like to know what I was doing  I was working away in Costa Coffee  blithely ignorant of your draconian rules for a car park that is never full.  EVER.

I ve been here 10 minutes. 8 cars have parked around me in the last few minutes using the parent and child bays. 6 of them were people on their own - no children  no disabled permits. 2 had little children with them. When I arrived I got the last space of these baby bays and you have a lot. Why can t you fine people who misuse these parking bays? Asda do and it s very effective. I have 2 children. 1 is in a toddler seat and my baby is in an infant carrier. It s almost impossible to park in a regular bay and know that I can open either side of the car doors without someone parking too close to get either of them in. People are totally abusing the bays and you don t do anything to prevent it?? (Just to add salt to the wound the cars in question today include a range rover  a BMW and a porsche)					2016-04-12T12:16:30+0000	1460463390	2016-04-12 14:16:30	18	26	18	0	44	23	12	11	20	0	18	0	0	0	0	0	0

Well I was totally impressed and put very at ease by the girl who pointed me towards the baby changing room.  It had a chair  nappies   wipes and a drinking water fountain and it was immaculate.  Well done Tesco :-) it can be hard breastfeeding when out if your not comfortable doing it in public so thank you for making it easy for me today! Also - I love the signs up on the wall saying to ask for help to the car with your shopping if your hands are full and to ask for nappies if you ve forgotten them :- D					2016-04-12T11:30:13+0000	1460460613	2016-04-12 13:30:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will be baking these lovely potatoes for my tea tonight- the traditional way in the oven of course (nobody wants a microwaved baked potato do they?).   Luckily I know that the right side of my oven gets hotter than the left  so if I put the hugely massive potato on the right hand side  there s a slim (fair to middling) chance that it may cook through enough to eat  and meanwhile  I ll be keeping my fingers crossed that its much smaller companion on the left will not be burned to a crisp.  Where is the dilemma I hear you ask? Well if  by some miracle  both potatoes do make it through the baking process and end up being edible at the end of it  who gets short shrift? Someone (probably me) is going to be disappointed with the size of their portion.   I see your stamp on the packaging says  freshness & quality . Let s also think  freshness & equality  in future please. :-)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12524167_569847989840933_6457463871310553361_n.jpg?oh=01efa72e8bea92ee9931c56174a68561&oe=5913FC7D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12524167_569847989840933_6457463871310553361_n.jpg?oh=8761b46071f450ac184d9b6c979734dc&oe=59069FBC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=569847989840933&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-12T10:43:19+0000	1460457799	2016-04-12 12:43:19	11	8	11	0	19	8	5	3	6	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

The driver accidentally snapped off the waste pipe that leads from our bathroom to the outside drain.  I appreciate that accidents happen and anticipated that Tesco would work quickly to agree a plan for fixing the damage caused.  However  despite phone calls by my husband chasing a resolution we have been passed from pillar to post with none of your managers willing to take responsibility.  On 2 April it was confirmed to us that the matter had been  escalated  to Head Office  but more than a week on  and 3 weeks after the incident we have received no communication from Head Office.  As a loyal Tesco customer spending an average of £500 - £600 in Tesco stores every month I am disgusted with this level of customer service and look forward to hearing from you with a suitable resolution to this situation.					2016-04-12T09:35:54+0000	1460453754	2016-04-12 11:35:54	1	14	2	0	16	14	4	10	5	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

Well today I m goint to change that  I m not going to give you strife  you see your toothpaste has transformed me  given me a better life. My teeth they were so sensitive  whether tepid  hot or cold  so I would wince and cringe and cry  my language sometimes bold! The pain it would be awful  my diet choices changed  no ice creams  lollies or sorbets  it s a wonder I m not deranged. So I set myself a challenge  a cure I d surely find  must be a solution somewhere  that solution I would find. I travelled up and down the aisles of many a chemist shop  The well known brands were expensive  it would cost me lots of money to make to problem stop. Then one day whilst out shopping  I spied your very own brand. I picked it up and did a jig  the price it was not grand. I brought it home excitedly and put in on the shelf  to sort my teeth and be pain free would not affect my wealth. The weeks have passed  the pain has gone  I really do feel jolly  until this point I d never known how much a loved a lolly! So I want to say a big thank you from the bottom of my heart  from the scientists to the shelf fillers  you all have played your part. Your toothpaste is amazing  a mini miracle in a box. Thank you Tesco  thank you! Your supermarket rocks!					2016-04-12T09:07:54+0000	1460452074	2016-04-12 11:07:54	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

No warning that the design has changed and 2 days after I started using them my little girl got the most terrible nappy rash that is being treated with a steroid cream prescribed by the doctor. The new nappies are much thinner and rougher than the old ones  I wouldn t want them against my skin!

At Tesco today Maia was at the self-service checkout paying for some animal cards.  I was at the next one with Ellie.   A man pushing a wheelchair pushed his trolley up to the basket bit (I thought thats a bit odd) then went stood right up behind Maia (so close I thought he was pressing into her).  I shouted at him  what you doing  get away.  He d assumed Maia was messing about so thought this was ok.  I even had to say step away use another till (there were plenty free).  He said say please.   Good thing he then did move away.  Totally inappropriate.   I m so glad I was there.  Maia told her mum afterwards she was terrified.     I forgot to leave my details with your staff when I spoke to them.   Your staff were very nice about it.					2016-04-12T00:43:08+0000	1460421788	2016-04-12 02:43:08	0	6	0	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I decided rather than Take my two older children shopping in the day (as it s half term) I would just take our new nine week old baby girl instead  in the evening. So after lots of feeding and a clean nappy ...off we went.  However once in my local Chorley store my little bundle proceeded to cry the whole way around the shop  now with quite a list and two weeks of Half term this shop needed to be done. So I stopped in the stores feeding room and fed the baby. This pattern continued for 45 min with me getting quite flustered and trying to steer a heavy trolley and bounce an unsettled baby at the same time. Then Tesco your lovely staff came to my rescue....like a beacon of light in the dark they helped me with my shopping. First I had a lovely lady who whilst I went and fed the baby took my list and trolley and finished off most of my shopping. I then had two lovely ladies at the till who helped me pack and load my trolley and reassure me that all was ok. They didn t make me feel awkward  they just chatted calmly despite my crying infant and cooed over how lovely she was. This in turn made me relax slightly (despite the fact I was frazzled). And as I left another lovely lady came and offered to help me to the car. She then unloaded my bags into the boot and put away the trolley.  Tesco to you this may seem like those ladies where just doing their job. But tonight they all went above and beyond and showed so Much kindness. My little girl was born early and looks like a new born  I am  feeding her myself and despite all best plans tonight she just wanted me to feed her more. I was able to do this and finish my shopping thanks to the wonderful staff in this store. I am eternally grateful and really think they should be recognised for their good work and help. Tonight Tesco every little really did help and these ladies are superstars!! 😊					2016-04-11T21:56:24+0000	1460411784	2016-04-11 23:56:24	3711	114	3898	190	4202	113	97	16	209	0	3665	172	11	1	0	0	0

Edinburgh based. Very unhappy. So no confirmation the items made it back to store (as delivery driver had no reader with him and n paper for me to sign to say I received order)  and no confirmation at all the items would be refunded and apparently this is exactly how it should be because the manager of Corstorphne store Edinburgh says apparently and the young man in Tesco customer services that Tesco has no obligation to confirm the items were received back at store or that a refund would take place- the vegetables delivered  that were returned had gone slimy in the packet and were out of date the next day on a 10pm delivery.					2016-04-11T20:56:03+0000	1460408163	2016-04-11 22:56:03	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We bought the sweetcorn pictured from our local store in Garforth (receipt also pictured with purchase date) and had them in the fridge within half an hour - we live very close by. Opened the packaging today and noticed that the sweetcorn was pallid and grey with dark marks. On closer inspection  it is soft to the touch and smells sour  as though it has been left out for several days. As I said  we ve noticed stock getting shorter and shorter sell by dates recently but to be selling spoilt food is just a whole new level of disappointing.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/941317_10154072147468427_872850558773772334_n.jpg?oh=2f94d3cddd35906db871d03b2b2ad0a5&oe=58DB15D1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/941317_10154072147468427_872850558773772334_n.jpg?oh=b57df7210bc8d92f5157143c604241fc&oe=59155726	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154072147468427&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-11T19:03:17+0000	1460401397	2016-04-11 21:03:17	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My boy choose these red velvet cookies as last time they were  deeeeelicious .  However  these cookies are substandard...  3 out of the 5 decided to leave their backsides at home and reveal their creamy innards to everyone!  I m not sure how this travesty has occurred and my only option has been to sandwich 2 together   which resulted in me breaching my daily  treat  allowance.   I will forgive you on this occasion   but please  in future  seal up your cookie bums!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12963381_10153564729932157_6655864539831314537_n.jpg?oh=defa94a442fb7645124378ebeaeffa94&oe=58D952DD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12963381_10153564729932157_6655864539831314537_n.jpg?oh=e131e60e7ee819f8117e6722fad1a28d&oe=591DD9D0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153564729932157&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-11T18:48:31+0000	1460400511	2016-04-11 20:48:31	4	6	5	1	12	5	3	2	0	0	4	0	0	1	0	0	0

Gave her all to the job. Went on maternity leave last year. Decided in November to take a new job. Did not like new job so resigned and reapplied at a local store: Firstly she did not meet the criteria for the actual store....what on earth is that all about? (She knows every aspect of job) Secondly  she also applied for Tesco Petrol station adjacent to said store...this is where fun starts. Applied for job Friday and Saturday totally around 12 hours. Said she does not ever want to work more than 25 hours a week and no more than 4 days. Flexi contract right? Err no wrong!! Flexi contract for Tesco means: You are contracted for 2 days per week. You are available for 25 hrs/4days If we need you to work these 25 hours you must do it or you are breaking the terms of your contract...oh and by the way you will only ever accrue holiday for two days per week even if you work four days every week for a year??? This is not a flexi contract. Fkexi bends both ways. This is a zero hours contract with frills and forced overtime. Daughter was offered job then offer retracted because she MUST  be available for 25 hours EVERY WEEK AT 24 HOURS NOTICE?? Absolute joke!!!! You can never make plans book an appointment or go anywhere just in case we need you???					2016-04-11T17:59:07+0000	1460397547	2016-04-11 19:59:07	2	22	2	0	24	20	11	9	13	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I complained to dave lewis my email was blocked . well you obviously could not care less .....you have never phoned back when you said and the only reason for wanting my email was to block me and even when I gave all my information to dave lewis I did not even get a response. no wonder you are losing customers .....what appalling service					2016-04-11T17:22:16+0000	1460395336	2016-04-11 19:22:16	0	17	0	1	18	17	3	14	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No indication from the packaging that anything has changed. Next day my lb was red and sore everywhere the nappy came into contact with his skin. Didnt think it would be the nappy at first until a few days later when I happened to notice that the old nappy I had in my changing bag has a completely different back and tabs by this point his poor little bum was bleeding. Having asked on a few local forum s im not the only one to have found this problem. If you change a product you have a obligation to inform your customers.					2016-04-11T17:13:02+0000	1460394782	2016-04-11 19:13:02	2	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The last time I placed an order  the driver who called me for direction and I gave him directions to my door step decided in the lift not to deliver my groceries again  thinking I said there is no one at home. The reason I would have told him that while I am the one giving him directions just beats my thinking.  He was quick to log with his manager that I was not at home (what a lie!!). Then Tesco decided to charge my account more than the goods I bought (40p more) and decided not to refund the full amount.   Several complaints via chat and phone calls  no one has deemed it fit to respond to my previous complaints about the quality of their service (from start-finish)  as of today when I got on online chat  the CSO refunded my 40p and said my complaints are now noted.  Does anyone wonder why Tesco profits are slipping?					2016-04-11T16:29:39+0000	1460392179	2016-04-11 18:29:39	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Having looked on the Tesco Direct website this morning for a cordless power drill  I found one on offer with yourselves at the bargain price of £19. Great!  After using the *stock in your local store* button  I established there were stock available in your Stalybridge store. Great! So off I went to the Stalybridge store  searched high and low for said drill and couldn’t find it. I asked a member of staff who informed me that the Stalybridge store does not stock this item. Erm….what about available stock showing online? Not so great!  I decided to look for another store which had stock in by using the *stock in your local area* button  I noticed Oldham  Huddersfield Road had some showing in stock. So off we went  parked up and in I went. Yey I found the item I wanted on the shelf with about 10 others. Took it to the till to see £33 on the self serve screen…hmm I thought this item was £19? After asking a member of staff about the price difference I was told that this was an online offer not store offer and to speak to customer services. Nowhere online does it mention it is an online offer only and if this was the case  why have the option to search local stores for stock at this price??  I went to customer services and explained the price issue to the lady stood behind the counter. She said also it was an online offer and not available in store. So why was I allowed to search for local stores in the area that stocked this item??? At this price??? She explained I could buy it now with click and collect and come back tomorrow after 3pm to collect it  but would have to pay £2 extra…..what?? £2 for what exactly? So if I have to pay £2 extra  then the drill is not £19 as clearly stated online  but it is in fact £21! What is the difference between me picking the item up today and tomorrow? They were in stock! The woman on the customer service desk was less than helpful with such an attitude. I understand she can only give me information she has  but manners and compassion wouldn’t have hurt her! If that’s what she calls customer service  geez id hate to see what her bad customer service is like! I have never experienced customer service like this.  I am a loyal customer of Tescos and have been for many years  im going to reconsider this! Thanks for wasting my time today tescos!  An answer to this would be appreciated asap…					2016-04-11T16:22:18+0000	1460391738	2016-04-11 18:22:18	1	11	1	0	12	11	5	6	7	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were very disappointed with the product. As you can see they are less onion rings covered in batter and more bits of onion and bits of batter mixed into a rather unappealing mess.

Its a heartbreaking disease  and I m sure many of you have known or loved someone who has it. There are a lot of similarities between a small child and a dementia sufferer  my Nannys new little quirks brought on by her disease often make me smile and laugh  its become her. I need to tell you about yesterday and how i almost lost that smile.  I went to meet my Mum and Nanny in Tesco Yeovil for a coffee and a catch up. Now like many Dementia sufferers my Nanny has sought comfort in a Doll  a toy for many children  comfort for my Nanny. She likes to bring the doll with her everywhere. Something I m proud that my family has no issues or embarrassment doing. The doll gives her lots of joy and comfort  but not just for her  for myself and family also  since loosing her beloved Husband  its means she not alone when she goes to sleep or when she wakes up  she has something to look after  something to mother  someone else to love.  Now when i went to order my coffee in Tesco  I noticed a lady staring at my Nanny  now of course people will look  double take  its different  something most haven t seen before  most go on with there day & don t give it a second thought. This Woman continued to stare  she was with her teenager daughter who told her to stop looking. I waited for my coffee  and sat back down  she continued to turn around  her back was turned to us  so as you can imagine making it extremely obvious she was staring. She then began to laugh  her daughter nervously laughing with her  telling her to stop. Continuing to giggle and stare at my Nanny  at us.  At this point  my whole body was raging  my tummy doing flips  for anyone that knows me  I don t shy away from confrontation  i wanted to run over there and tell her exactly what i thought! I wanted to get my Nanny out of there and protect her. But instead i looked over at her and her doll  smiling  happy enjoying having coffee with her Daughter and Granddaughter  not a care in the world. She didn t notice the rude woman laughing at her  the anger in my face  the upset in my Mums. We did not say a word about the situation to each other  my Mum went for a cigarette and took a time out  i turned my back to the woman and we continued as if nothing had happened. As much as i wanted to run over and scream at her  for my Nanny sake we just laughed and smiled with each other.  So to the Woman who laughed  the woman who stared - I Thank you  because i now know i can deal with the situation i was always dreading  the way it should be dealt with.  I hope you can bring your daughter up a lot better than you were raised. Ive still got my smile.  I wanted to write this  just to raise a little awareness  I ve seen and heard of a lot of dementia suffers  taking comfort in dolls  teddies etc  Please don t be cruel  that could be your loved one  one day.					2016-04-11T15:25:34+0000	1460388334	2016-04-11 17:25:34	13	9	14	0	23	9	6	3	10	0	12	1	0	0	0	0	0

My aim is to spread awareness about an issue that has been around for decades.   My girlfriend works at the checkout at Sainsbury s  and has experienced this problem since she started working there a few years ago. The problem I am referring to is customers (particularly men aged 30+) approaching her outside of her working hours.   Of course  part of a shop assistant s job is to be kind to customers and make sure that they are fully satisfied  and so to do this they must smile and make small talk so that customers feel happy and comfortable. However  this behaviour  probably 90% of the time  is mistaken for  flirtation  and consent for the customer to approach the employee if they see them outside of the workplace.   Now I m not talking about a customer passing by an employee in the street just saying  hello!  and moving on. What I m talking about is customers physically stopping employees in the street by grabbing their arm  and then proceeding to talk with the employee for more than 10 minutes  and continuing to talk even after the employee has told them they need to leave. In a lot of cases  some of which I have experienced myself in a retail job  customers even ask employees for their phone number.  This is harassment. It may not be sexual or physical  but it is still harassment  and it s an issue that seriously needs to be dealt with. Of course the employee in these kinds of situations has no choice but to be kind and considerate to the customer as their jobs can potentially be at risk if they seem rude in any way  and so the answer could not simply be for the employee to dismiss the customer straight away or politely explain that they do not wish to talk to the customer outside of work. There is always a risk that the customer will react with aggression  or even complain about you to the company that you work for.   My girlfriend suffers from anxiety  but has overcome so much in the past few years. Now she has told me recently that she worries on her walk to work every day that she will bump into a customer and have to put up with this harassment again and again.   Something needs to be done. I don t know what  but this is a problem for customers in workplaces all around the globe. I hope I can at least raise more awareness with this message  and I hope that customers read this and think again about approaching employees outside of their workplace.					2016-04-11T13:05:24+0000	1460379924	2016-04-11 15:05:24	2	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have used tesco nappies with all of my children but am sad to say  I am going to have to look elsewhere. Firstly I don t believe they are as absorbant. Up until the change we almost never experienced leaks now they constantly leak. Secondly the change in the waistband is useless on children with a very small waist. I am finding the nappy slips as soon as there is any liquid in it. The only reason I still did my grocery shopping in Tesco was because I could pick up nappies at the same time. I now will take my grocery shopping to the next supermarket I can get decent nappies from.					2016-04-11T10:12:40+0000	1460369560	2016-04-11 12:12:40	1	10	1	0	11	10	10	0	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had a delivery yesterday and noticed that we had three packs of strawberries. Obviously  he protested his innocence and said he hadn t ordered that many and of course I just said  yeh whatever ! 😂 To prove me wrong  he checked our order and it listed strawberries twice  once showing 2 items and another showing one. He checked our order confirmation email and it only showed one had been ordered?! Needless to say he was quite pleased as he had been exonerated  but is now wondering about all the other times we ve received multiple items and I ve moaned at him for his incompetence! 😂🙈					2016-04-11T08:37:36+0000	1460363856	2016-04-11 10:37:36	3	7	3	0	10	7	3	4	5	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

On looking at the box for your  Free From Honey Hoops  they look just like your average box of cereal  so I justified spending more than I normally would on cereal. However on opening the box I was annoyed that it was half empty! The bag the cereal is in is almost half the size of the box. I know you put the weight on the box but I can t help but feel this is misleading as on the outside it seems a lot more than what is actually in the box.  As a sufferer of coeliac disease I am always grateful when new gluten free products come on the market but I really will think again as for the amount you get this is a bit of a rip off!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12998514_10209275633837124_3022561324219407863_n.jpg?oh=dc9d42939f792f5c40a2cba2aef507ba&oe=58DC84C5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12998514_10209275633837124_3022561324219407863_n.jpg?oh=a80000a9ce5d2ac0e97f90cd07e2c78f&oe=591299C8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209275633837124&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-11T06:37:02+0000	1460356622	2016-04-11 08:37:02	5	1	5	1	7	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve tried using three different payment cards and get the same message for each.  Since its past 10pm on a Sunday your customer service line is closed but I needed this order for tomorrow.  I ve googled the error message and other people have experienced it when there has been a problem with the site so it seems the problem is not from my end.  Forum suggestions include deleting my address and re-entering it but this has made no difference.  Obviously I can call in the morning but by then it will be too late to have my shopping delivered tomorrow.

Substitutions that in no way could ever be considered a substitute ie beef mince to replace a beef joint. We ve even received meat that after only one night in the fridge went off (it was refrigerated upon arrival at our house) even though it s use by date said it should have been good for four days. I wasn t sure you could top rotten meat BUT today you proved me wrong because today we received broccoli!!!  (please see the picture below showing tesco hemel Hempsteads understanding of broccoli). REALLY TESCO?! Really?!!  We had to laugh but you should be utterly embarrassed and I absolutely will be complaining in the morning.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12963939_1161096723901686_5147542928219084766_n.jpg?oh=a524492a85bacb1e68c04a8cbc6340b9&oe=591AEF7A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12963939_1161096723901686_5147542928219084766_n.jpg?oh=0391ead727ec226491ecdcca92936a0f&oe=5918E96F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1161096723901686&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-10T20:15:42+0000	1460319342	2016-04-10 22:15:42	2	4	3	0	7	4	2	2	2	0	2	0	0	1	0	0	0

I noticed the chicken drumsticks were out of date  the product states that it should be use by 9th and clearly in retail this should be reduced the day before or on the day and should be removed from sale after the date. You can clearly see that this was purchase on 10th April 2016! Picture of drumsticks upload in comments! I would like a response  selling out of date meat products is a joke!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12985400_10156754124785463_4467684272602933217_n.jpg?oh=4f6cb3617bcb0d73b61fbc8f84401026&oe=59170BEF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12985400_10156754124785463_4467684272602933217_n.jpg?oh=0df79c19588646303f9fb877263b6798&oe=590E1EE2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156754124785463&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-10T20:13:48+0000	1460319228	2016-04-10 22:13:48	1	5	3	0	8	4	3	1	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0

My account for some reason is still registered to my previous address despite trying to change it and successfully changing my club card address. Anyway I ordered on Friday morning for my shopping to be delivered Saturday.  It didn t turn up  I contacted the grocery department to which they told me it had gone to my old address. The lady didn t really care that my family s £80 food shop had gone somewhere else. The best she could offer was a 3-5 day refund. She did however tell me to re order. So £160 out of pocket for a fault with either yourselves or the app. I will not be using tesco online again I will be going else where.  Very unhelpful customer service and very stressful for a single mother.					2016-04-10T20:03:53+0000	1460318633	2016-04-10 22:03:53	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just wanted to ask why your cafe has such a poor selection of dairy free foods? Your stores have wonderful free from sections and we often shop there. However today we decided to have a little nibble whilst there. We visited your large store in Bedford. The staff were pretty helpful and provided the allergy chart however the only dairy free child option they had was not available  she wanted a pack lunch bag like her older sister but all the sandwiches and most of the selections such as cheese and yogurts are not suitable. We asked for some scramble egg on toast but your scramble egg comes in large containers and contains milk. We went through the menu and any non dairy options which were very limited were all high in fat and salt which are very unsuitable for a dairy free child. Could you please make a dairy free sandwich or something so that our little ones can have a pack lunch bag. You are missing out on a very large market. I shall be posting my complaint on several allergy sites as I feel others would feel the same. Many thanks naomi					2016-04-10T18:49:30+0000	1460314170	2016-04-10 20:49:30	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last week a girl working on the meat/fish counter decided to use the mirrored side of the reduced fridge when re-tying her hair up.  This week the same girl had more hair out of her hat then in it. Not only does she have a very long ponytail hanging at the back  but she has long strands of hair pulled out at the sides. Health and safety training states  hair should be covered with a clean hat or net. Long hair should be tied back as well. Surely if you have staff with long hair working on the food counters nets AS WELL AS hats should be worn?					2016-04-10T17:19:04+0000	1460308744	2016-04-10 19:19:04	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

And to my utter shock his cat food was white and blue and was mouldy!   We fed him half the pouch this morning and noticed he had been sick. Now I know why.   I have used Whiskas pouches for over a year now and have never had this issue. We store his pet food in a cupboard at room temperature as advised. I buy this cat food from Tesco & B&M s.  As a loyal customer  I am utterly disgusted that this has happened.   I would like to warn other customers of this and to always check your pet food.

I pay for delivery saver each month and have been for almost 2 years. I had a delivery booked for deliver between 1pm and 2 pm and it hasn t arrived and when I call up I get told there s been a  serious incident  in store and will not be getting my delivery for at least another hour but no definitive delivery time. So if this incident is so bad then someone should have contacted your telephone team and then contacted the customers. I now have to rearrange my day to wait in for a delivery that may never come. As for the attitude of the customers services agent who basically said tough there s nothing that can be done. I would be sacked if I spoke to my customers that way. Technically Tescos are in breach of contract I will be cancelling my Direct debit and will be shopping with Asda from now on.					2016-04-10T13:32:08+0000	1460295128	2016-04-10 15:32:08	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We paid it because she had a operation during the year and was still on medication. This year they have put it up to 134.71 pounds a month. HELP  we are disgusted. We cannot pay this amount  it s more than our electric and gas amount every month.It s gone up 100 percent! Can any one help.TESCO WE ARE disgusted at you!!!!!.					2016-04-10T13:27:42+0000	1460294862	2016-04-10 15:27:42	1	7	2	0	9	7	4	3	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Can you hold one for me and I ll get there straight away? I was told no  no in store reservations. I left and went straight there. I couldn t find the product on the shelves so spoke to customer service. They informed me it was the store I spoke to but a head office department. They couldn t locate the product nor was it showing on their system. I then tried searching for a phone number for another store. But got put through to the same head office number. I have wasted an hour of my time  2 phone call and petrol to drive there all for nothing.					2016-04-10T12:25:00+0000	1460291100	2016-04-10 14:25:00	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My wife and I have been in hospital with my daughter who is unwell. When I left the hospital last night to get some dinner for us both and to pick up some coke my wife called to say that she needs some headphones as the TV sound goes off at 21:00 and she wanted to be able to listen to what she was watching. I went into the store and asked one of your managers who s name was Ben ( I think he is the online manager) where the headphones were in the store. He took me to them and on the way we were talking and I explained about being in hospital with my daughter and what had happened with the TV. He said that I can t imagine what you are going through and the least you want to be worrying about is headphones please have them on us. I was so taken back that Ben had obviously seen I was a little tired and emotional and offered this very kind gesture. It felt like he had given me a million pounds. This goes to show that there are some very kind people out there and I am still overwhelmed with Bens very kind gesture. Please can I ask that this gets shown to the most senior person possible so that Ben gets the most amount of credit as possible. Thank you Tesco for employing people like Ben.					2016-04-10T11:42:48+0000	1460288568	2016-04-10 13:42:48	26	2	26	0	28	2	2	0	0	0	26	0	0	0	0	0	0

As you charge over £3 for gf cereals  could we please get the full amount in the box?? I ll attach a picture of a normal box of cocoa pops for comparison. I normally never complain but these products are expensive and I m living on a budget. If I were having to buy this for kids or more than 1 coeliac that box wouldn t last more than 2-3 bowls.

Diet coke is the same price as coke!   Tesco sponsors Diabetes Uk so i do not understand why your meal deals don t include sugar free drinks!  She is very upset that this has happened!  I suggest been a sponser for Diabeties Uk you include sugar free drinks with any deals you have!

I d love it if it could somehow find its way back to the lady in question!    Yesterday in your Newport Spytty store we were served by a lady called Gillian.  She was an older lady with red hair and I was  as always  with with my 5 year old son Jasper.  Every time we get to a till  Jas puts his teddy on the conveyerbelt to see how much it s worth. First though  the teddy is cunningly concealed by some form of grocery. Yesterday  some popcorn!  We have to do this Every. Single. Time.   To an adult  he can clearly be seen  but to a 5 year old he is invisible and this is hilarious.  I have to play along as I m his mum and that s my job......but normally  cashiers are not so enthusiastic.  And then we met Gill!   Not only did this delightfully crazy lady play along  but she added to his game!  She couldn t see him at all due to his amazing disguise  she pretended to be shocked  she embellished  she wanted to know his name and it absolutely made my son s day! (If truth be told  it made mine too)   So thank you Gillian.  I hope this gets back to you. You are a good sport and deserve recognition for being so fun and fabulous!  I m sure I speak for the majority of mums  that when people try so hard to engage with your child and make them smile  it makes you smile too.  As Tesco themselves say  every little helps!   So thanks again  love Liz  Jasper and Snowy the filthy little Polar Bear.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12936601_10156809608980008_283008271930895457_n.jpg?oh=64c9f1cfb9143e2e83d158a333081a95&oe=59087032	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12936601_10156809608980008_283008271930895457_n.jpg?oh=a53f8d17c3795c14129a02207740f4d9&oe=5911FF27	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156809608980008&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-10T09:31:27+0000	1460280687	2016-04-10 11:31:27	400	90	423	200	713	89	33	56	160	0	395	23	0	0	0	0	0

(see picture below) I have used tescos nappies for two and a half years now and I ve never had a problem with them lasting threw the night for my children. But since the design change they have become awful. Now I know children wee more in the night so a night nappy will be fuller than a day nappy but as I said id never had a problem till now.

They smell horrendous. There s a strong chemical type smell after and liquid hits them and on a few occasions in the morning my child s  area  has been covered in the gel type crystals. To be honest I m probably going to stop buying them now which is a bit of an inconvenience.					2016-04-10T06:55:41+0000	1460271341	2016-04-10 08:55:41	0	7	0	0	7	6	2	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered £225 shopping from Tesco s On line but they cancelled my order and did not tell me this was due for delivery at 12-1 yesterday. after 3 phones and a promise of sorting it out no one has called me back still no shopping and a ruined wasted weekend. I have shopped with Tesco s for 15 years and my shopping has been delayed 3-5 hours on at least 8 times and finally cancelled for been high risk. which is an insult as I put matches on the order which is freely available on the website. I emailed the chairman but got no  response and now I am left with still no shopping and a wasted weekend which since I work is precious. So Tesco s you could not care two hoots about your customer s and you never bother to put thing right or ring back when you say . what an utter disgrace. no wonder you are doing badly if you treat loyal customer s like this . I spend 150-225 per week with you. how many other customer s have you treated like this. I am upset and disgusted and you have done nothing to help me or put it right. Shame on you					2016-04-10T06:07:25+0000	1460268445	2016-04-10 08:07:25	0	19	0	0	19	18	10	8	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Visited your Great Notley store in Braintree late at 11:35 25 minutes before closing as my girlfriend works late and this was the only chance we had to go  just needed a few bits so wouldn t take long.  We proceeded told by several members of staff that the store was due to close shortly which was fine as we expected this. Everything went well until we got to the checkout just after 11.50 with what we thought would be more than enough time to scan our items.  As we were walking to the checkout with a small basket of items the security guard waiting at the self checkout shouted out  doubt you ll be getting that through before we close  which we ignored as we could not tell whether he was joking or not. The customer service assistant at the self checkout sighed as we walked up and then proceeded to almost steal our basket away and rushed our items through the self checkout and then put them on the floor and told us to pack them! In the mean time the security guard was making comments in the back ground that were in no way subtle   for god sake  didn t you know the store closes at 12  this isn t 24 hours today you know  why do customers do this  next time come earlier   this was all right behind us and the assistant at the checkout was just agreeing with the security guard whilst packing our shopping leaving my girlfriend and myself standing there just shocked! The assistant then proceeded to give us instructions to pack our shopping immediately as the store was about to close which we were well aware of then telling my girlfriend to pay quickly  to get her change and receipt before nearly had to hand it to her himself. The security guard behind us was telling customers coming through the door that the store was closed  even though this was before 12 and the doors were still open. One customer got sent out even though she just wanted some bread and milk. If a store is advertised as closing at 12 then why are your employees turning business away if it s not yet closing time? Surely that cannot be commercial? I told both employees that you shouldn t treat customers this way and it is in no way acceptable to do so which they did not reply to. Finally we were escorted to the door quickly which was fine as we couldn t wait to leave at this point. As we left one of your employees who opened the door for us apologised for the service and said I hope you do come back to us and I thanked him for noticing as my girlfriend made them aware next time we wouldn t return.  I cannot understand how you can let your staff act this way and treat customers so badly considering its customers like myself who actually keep your business running. I have always worked with the public and would never treat a customer in this way. What your employees say behind closed doors is one thing but saying it in front of a customer is just plain rude  especially as we do our weekly shopping there.					2016-04-09T23:46:19+0000	1460245579	2016-04-10 01:46:19	0	41	1	1	43	40	21	19	30	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

It looked icky and black  like bird-poo  but the kitten food was fish-flavoured!  I binned the pouch and the other pouches were OK  but thought you d want to know.  Poor Odin (our 7 month old rescue kitten) wasn t impressed that he got fed after the other cats instead of first!  :(	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q83/s130x130/12936507_1740603386157805_6109452043826416800_n.jpg?oh=f533d783b76b08cf19622faa064508f7&oe=591E0C6C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/q84/s720x720/12983932_1740603386157805_6109452043826416800_o.jpg?oh=0be530818a5e234a1c8eda05f933637f&oe=59118266	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1740603386157805&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-09T23:37:14+0000	1460245034	2016-04-10 01:37:14	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have been using Tesco Ultra Dry nappies and wipes and always been very happy with them. During the last few days  I m sure you wont wish to imagine  they have been well and truly tried and tested. I can t speak highly enough of these products  they have been reliable  kind to my babies bottoms and with the volume we have been through come up trumps cost-wise. Yesterday alone we went through 53 nappies and three packs of wipes. Having tried big name brands previously  as well as competitor supermarkets  your nappies are by far the best I have found and have been a saving grace for a mother surrounded by poo (albeit contained) in her hour of need. We have also noticed the new and improved elastic sides and tabs which have massively reduced accidents and therefore save me hours of floor cleaning and baby clothes soaking. Thank you very much Tesco.					2016-04-09T19:57:06+0000	1460231826	2016-04-09 21:57:06	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I had the most traumatising and yet amazing experience at Tesco - Oak Tree Lane - Mansfield. After a super quick dash around your store with my 16 month old little boy  I returned to my car   threw my car keys into the front seat so I wouldn t lose them  fastened my little boy into his car seat  got out and as I walked around my car to get in the drivers side  it randomly locked. Locked. The doors locked and my little boy and my keys were inside. It was also really really sunny.  Needless to say I completely freaked out and managed to find a Tesco delivery driver and begged him for help. He signalled another man to get help and that s when your staff descended on me and my situation with the upmost compassion and care. I think there must have been 10-15 different people trying to help us. Lending their personal phones  one of your drivers was a mechanic by trade and tried his best to break in without damaging the car  a manager called the fire brigade  staff brought coat hangers to try fish my keys out of a tiny gap  staff brought toys  water  biscuits so that my son could be pacified when we got him out. They never left my side. Their compassion was genuine and their worry was evident. Afterwards  after the fire brigade smashed my car open  one of your team leaders/managers  took me and my son inside and sat with us until we were ok and I felt safe to drive  she even got him a snack as I must have mentioned he hadn t eaten. As I left I was given a massive hug and some flowers. I can categorically say that today was the most traumatic day of my life  watching my baby boy cry his eyes out  trapped in a hot car for almost 40 minutes pouring with sweat  and yet I ve never felt so supported or safe. Oh and when I got back to my car one of your staff had cleaned up the glass from inside best he could and patched up the gaping hole with duct tape. I feel so sad that I forgot everyone s name  I want to tell you the name of each and every one of them as they all deserve praise from management. What an incredible team you have at that store. I am forever indebted to them. Please please ensure that everyone there today (the van drivers  floor staff  team leaders  managers) all hear back from this and know that they are amazing. Thank you a thousand times xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Just a quick update for those who can t just take this post for what it is  a simple heartfelt thank you. It wasn t posted to gain sympathy or ask people to comment on my parenting skills. It was a plain old simple thank you to the people who were there for me and my son when I needed someone. So to dispel some myths/clarify a few things for those who made ridiculous comments: - I don t care more about my car than my child. I would have happily smashed it in immediately. In fact that was my first suggestion  realising that I didn t carry a hammer in my back pocket that day  or a rock or a brick I went with option B. Ask for help. And I can confirm that at no point did I ever request that the people helping me not damage my car - we didn t smash the window  and yes the fire brigade did. However  when you smash a car window  front back or sides the glass explodes  it flys all over the car  no matter where he was sat the fire brigade were adamant that we wait as they would cover the window in a sticky plastic so that when they broke it the majority would stick to it and hopefully not harm my child. Even with the sticky stuff glass still went everywhere so I dread to think how bad it would have been if they hadn t used it - luca didn t cry for the whole 40 minutes  yes he was warm but he was ok and laughing at all the different people who were doing everything they could to keep him calm. I on the other had was a wreck. Fairly normal and forgivable I think. Anywho after about 25/30 min the poor little guy had had enough and started to cry. As he got more upset he got hotter and hotter. No we didn t sit staring at him for a full 40 minutes watching him cry and melt. 15 minutes of his crying was like a life time and no amount of keyboard warriors can make me feel any more crappy than I already do. Pointing out what you would or wouldn t have done in a judgemental way is appalling. Mothers should stick together not bring each other down. Also I m DYING to meet that perfect mother that has never made a mistake or needed help. When I find you I m going to clone you and make millions  - I did call the AA  they were useless and said they would be 45/60 mins  Thanks to everyone else who left lovely supportive messages and shared your stories  so glad to know what we parents are all (except those perfect few) in it together. Be nice to each other people and cut out the negative people who want to bring others down to their own miserable lives  that s just not for me I m afraid ❤️❤️❤️	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12932962_10101470737188292_5250983016218461382_n.jpg?oh=adeae1e66cb9b992c1a919d424ce8860&oe=5918E833	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12932962_10101470737188292_5250983016218461382_n.jpg?oh=0c7ae9e6cc502551d8a9a4194cebfce1&oe=5906223E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101470737188292&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-09T19:19:15+0000	1460229555	2016-04-09 21:19:15	38617	1065	40527	3847	45439	1034	747	287	5599	0	38072	1708	154	4	6	0	0

The reduction in size is ridiculous  even the lady serving had a  hand to forehead  moment when I questioned it and commented that people had been pulling her up on it all day.  My question is how can you get away with this? I certainly didn t fall for such a blatant scam but wonder where else in the store you do this?  Shame on you Tesco...... 😡					2016-04-09T19:08:37+0000	1460228917	2016-04-09 21:08:37	3	7	3	0	10	7	2	5	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

My friend purchased three Ginsters Chicken & Bacon Pasties  shelf edge lable said £1.00 each. The till said £1.60  we know this is the correct price  BUT legally if the shop misprice a product  they are required by the Sale of Goods Act  to complete the sale @ the indicated price.  Demanding the extra £1.80 is totally illegal  and I and my friend feel so agreved that we posted this facebook post and will not be visiting the store again any time soon.  PS we have previously been good customers of the store!  Sending a member of staff to remove the shelf edge lable rather than owning up to a mistake is a despicable way of behaving!					2016-04-09T18:47:01+0000	1460227621	2016-04-09 20:47:01	0	10	0	0	10	7	7	0	16	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went into your store on Stukeley meadows today for four items  1. Meringue nests (tesco brand) they didn t have only  finest  @ £1.69 or 2 for 2.50 2. Whipping cream....They didn t have! 3. Cat food (whiskers multi pack) didn t have only Felix 12 pouches! 4. Chicken casserole mix....didn t have only chilli con carne! Had to go tesco extra....out of my way. BUT what I did notice only on meringues as couldn t be bothered checking others. Your  finest   meringue nest were £1.59 or 2 for 2.50?????  How does a smaller store with less overheads etc to pay out.....plus you get all your stock from same suppliers manage to charge MORE For the same items? RIP OFF springs to mind.

We thought we would give you another chance today as we had just been out in the forest with dogs and needed a quick bite to eat.  First i was told it would be 6 mins. No problem with that. Well it turned into 15-20 mins. I went back to counter and bloke waiting said he had waited ages as no chips. I was told we were waiting for my beans!  Eventually long after my husband had eaten his food it arrived.  Oh the disappointment the photo does not do it justice. It is on a teaplate that you would be served a scone on!! There were 7 chips you can count them on the picture!  Had I known i would have just gone to the burger van outside the shop and eaten in my van. At least it would have been a nice hot dog with onions and a proper portion of chips.  Seriously i know its not a michelin star restaurant but a little value for money would be good.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12718221_10156813490810711_1858178392082145829_n.jpg?oh=c61468a06886f1e1f7a3c6242d9b27f4&oe=59090482	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12718221_10156813490810711_1858178392082145829_n.jpg?oh=2c75e41236438cad3ad732e09f778108&oe=59135BF6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156813490810711&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-09T16:07:27+0000	1460218047	2016-04-09 18:07:27	7	32	9	1	42	29	12	17	11	0	7	0	0	0	1	1	0

Whilst I was impressed by the service I was offered by the mobile phone sale s man  the lady at the money exchange and the car valet service  I m afraid I cannot say the same for my experience in the café. At first all was well. My children enjoyed a sausage and chip lunch whilst I enjoyed a hot coffee. When my elder son  Oscar  finished  he asked if he could have one of the yummy chocolate muffins he had spotted whilst ordering lunch. Now  my younger son had not quite finished so I took this opportunity to give Oscar a bit of  independence  and a little life learning experience. I handed him a £5 note  and said to him   make sure you join the back of the queue  be patient  be poliet . I could see the glee in his face that I  for the first time trusted him to venture a little further by himself and take this step. When he walked nicely over to the counter I positioned myself so I could see both my younger son finishing his lunch  and Oscar  queueing for his muffin. What I saw next I watched in disbelief  and my heart sank. Not one person acknowledged my son who  after waiting patiently was now at the front of the line. Instead I watch customer after customer being served instead. His little smile  turned into frustration  yet he still stood waiting patiently. I walked over  helped him pick his muffin and we went to the till together. It was only then he was acknowledged.  I m writing this because if it had been an adult in that situation it would not be stood for. I am raising my son s to treat ALL people with respect  have manners and patients. Something I feel he demonstrated a lot more than your staff and customers today. Please make your staff aware they should acknowledge EVERYBODY. What if my son was a little boy lost and wanting someone to help him? No one even bothered to ask. As for my son  I m proud that he remained patient and polite. Something I struggled to do after witnessing his puzzled little face as to why no one was looking at him.  As for his little life lesson  not all people are raised with manners.					2016-04-09T15:55:50+0000	1460217350	2016-04-09 17:55:50	13	14	13	2	29	14	8	6	15	0	13	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was planning on buying your hundreds and thousands/sprinkle celebration cake as it met our allergy requirements but I can t find it on the app anymore.   Has it been discontinued? I was really looking forward to my little boy having a proper birthday cake for his first birthday  cake smash photoshoot. I ve built up our photo set around the cake because it was the only one he could have and I ll be very disappointed if it s discontinued as there are no alternatives I can see. I really want to be spending his birthday with him rather than in the kitchen hand decorating a cake. :(					2016-04-09T15:37:16+0000	1460216236	2016-04-09 17:37:16	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The queue in the cafe wasn t particularly long but we still queued for over 30 minutes for 3 bacon & sausage baps and a couple of drinks. The staff seemed friendly enough but appeared overwhelmed by the task of serving customers & cooking food and making drinks all at the same time. While we queued several people left the queue and decided against dining. Eventually we sat down to eat our baps but were astounded by the appalling presentation and portions of the baps  sausages that looked like they d been torn in half rather than neatly cut and bacon that was hard  cold  small and one piece looked like it had been bitten. My hot chocolate was bitter and definitely not a quality hot chocolate that reflected the £2:40 that I d paid for it. All in all the whole experience was hugely disappointing and my kids said we should have gone to Sainsburys in Rhyl because they have a real cafe where they serve quality food in a reasonable time. This was the first time I ve visited Tesco cafe in Prestatyn and it will definitely be the last  I d also strongly advise any of my friends to avoid this cafe too  Value for money it certainly was not	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12112501_10154108136836563_6968315505032069348_n.jpg?oh=7d6b98de1a795fee1d4724ada4c0b741&oe=58D72877	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12112501_10154108136836563_6968315505032069348_n.jpg?oh=d140553b390ff9bea3f3f0e0b247cd2a&oe=58D9867A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154108136836563&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-09T15:23:03+0000	1460215383	2016-04-09 17:23:03	8	12	10	1	23	12	3	9	11	0	8	0	1	0	0	1	0

We just bought one of these  hand finished  loaves from your Redditch store after being enticed by the free sampling on the way in. We were even handed a warm one by the man in the bakery. Despite this  the middle is very very cold - much colder than you d expect  given that the outside is still very warm. Is this just something frozen that you ve heated up and passed off as a premium product? Your current farming branding makes me suspicious that this may the case.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12993559_10154141911348760_1644737713241633593_n.jpg?oh=b403ad6085d6cd9922e59730b221be5b&oe=58DC236F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12993559_10154141911348760_1644737713241633593_n.jpg?oh=604ffb5ab363f24b5fe9f50fd32fdd08&oe=5922FC1B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154141911348760&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-09T14:54:46+0000	1460213686	2016-04-09 16:54:46	9	7	9	1	17	7	1	6	1	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a click and collect order and I must say everything was perfect  picked and stacked correctly and with care  checked by a woman called Emma  and when she noticed the substitution that was given she provided a second alternative substition on meals what we had previously ordered so knew we liked.

On Thursday I had a delivery to my house full of wonderful Treats!! Now normally I am very happy to see the men that come to my door to bring me food. . who wouldn t. They are always so polite and play chit chat with my delightfully snotty children.   But this Thursday I was a little annoyed that while bringing the create full of wonderfulness to my door the tesco man knocked a few of my plant pots spilling mud all over my path. . now I have no idea of knowing if this was on purpose or an accident as he was already at the door by the time I saw.   A little annoyed I kept it to myself and stewed about it. More annoyed at myself for being a wimp and not asking him why he didn t just move them or even wait and I would have!!   Then tesco  you wonderful people  send me a text asking me about the service today. Normally it s 2 or 3 texts asking me on a scale how happy was I.  For the first time ever I gave you bottom marks. I know I felt bad but I was hoping to get my pent up annoyance but then you simply reply. oh sorry. . . well not quite but no asking why. . or how. . nothing.   So Now I m taking to passive aggressively leaving a message on here to finally get out my annoyance over my poor muddy path!  Now That feels good to get it out.					2016-04-09T13:36:25+0000	1460208985	2016-04-09 15:36:25	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been to Spring Hill Tesco in Birmingham this morning to do a big shop and the trolley that I had would not go in a straight line.  Now this usually would not be an issue for me as generally I would have my husband with me  however this morning he was sleeping.  I don t think it is fair to wake my husband up on a Saturday morning to come and push my wonky trolley in Tesco.  I had to struggle the whole way round bashing into people.  Please get the tracking sorted on your trolleys  there is a place that we take our car too and I am sure they would offer a discount for you on a job lot of trolleys.  Kind regards.					2016-04-09T12:09:20+0000	1460203760	2016-04-09 14:09:20	9	10	11	1	22	10	6	4	21	0	9	2	0	0	0	0	0

Now Ive had to do that way too many times this past few months and ecah time you reassure me things will improve. well they dont! I want action not empty words! whats he whinging about now I hear you ask? well  one of my gripes has been items that come with the packaging torn or opened  so last night I go to prepare a nice healthy salad as I do frequently (nose grows a bit) when I notice he lettuce hearts are alreay open  on first glance said lettuce looks ok  then I peel off the first layer of leaves and cut into the lettuce! UGH! it was simply crawling with lil brown flies  very similar to greenfly only brown  loads were dead but equally loads were happily crawling their foul lil way around my lettuce! now I dont know about you but dead and crawlies in my lettuce are a bit of a no no? so my point is I am very disappointed to yet again have to complain and more so to complain about the same thing.					2016-04-09T10:43:35+0000	1460198615	2016-04-09 12:43:35	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But after the letter I received yesterday from Tesco practically calling me a liar I feel I have to. Don t buy Tesco own brand of orange juice. I was making smoothies last week and when I went to pour the orange into the blender something fell out. I scraped it out with my finger and it was a tablet (pill). I contacted Tesco customer service and they asked me to bring the juice carton over along with the pill and the receipt. They said they would send them away to be tested and they would keep me up to date. I just received a letter yesterday from them saying nothing that size would have got through their production line and if a pill had of been in a carton of orange for more than 24 hours it would have dissolved. That s clearly a lie as the pill did manage to get into the carton somehow and it didn t dissolve and I had it more than 24 hours. They as good as called me a liar. I will be contacting my solicitor. God only knows what that tablet was and I highly doubt that they are going to be honest about what it was. I actually Googled out of curiosity  I found a pill in my orange juice  and it came up that it also happened to a guy in England. I feel that the Tesco orange juice should be lifted off the shelves. God forbid a child consumed that tablet. I dread to think what may have happened. Horrified is an understatement!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12990913_287621958236078_8969683354894644947_n.jpg?oh=55e2870e110cbcb610f728604ed9c546&oe=5919C983	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12990913_287621958236078_8969683354894644947_n.jpg?oh=8fcdd47549bc153e1de2e2a67cbee2ab&oe=59204C42	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=287621958236078&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-09T10:31:33+0000	1460197893	2016-04-09 12:31:33	76	47	88	59	194	41	16	25	24	0	73	0	8	0	0	4	0

I have stopped buying them as a result of getting box after box of rubbish  soggy cones with a skid mark worth of chocolate as I feel so ripped off getting a crap icecream far too often now! They look nothing like the pack  and often don t have a mix of both icecream flavours too! I fail to believe the excuse that these things just happen from time to time  as when we first got hooked on them  they were great  and the quality severely went downhill afterwards!					2016-04-09T09:56:38+0000	1460195798	2016-04-09 11:56:38	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I have sold my car and called up to cancel my insurance. I have paid £77 per month with you since I have had the policy. I am disgusted that you are charging £40 to cancel this policy. All you have to do is send a letter (with a stamp) and cancel on your computer screens. I would like to know exactly what I get for the £40 other than my pants pulled down.   I can assure you never again will I take out Tesco car insurance. I m sure Tesco make millions of pounds a year in profits and still feel it s acceptable to charge £40 to cancel.   I think I might have to reconsider spending a penny with the Tesco brand in the future.					2016-04-09T08:50:53+0000	1460191853	2016-04-09 10:50:53	7	20	7	0	27	19	15	4	37	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also why is a lot of tesco s own brand products in plastic packaging that is not recyclable? Is this something that tesco are looking into?

What can I say.... NEVER AGAIN!!! I usually shop for 2-3 weeks in advance of my delivery date. Five days before my delivery date  I encountered a problem with the search engine (*1* result when I searched for jam!). I reported it  but didn t get a reply from Asda until the day after my delivery. One of their substitutions made no sense - I wanted a jar of tahini and was sent a smoked BBQ rub instead. One of their substitutions was sending me 140g of cashews instead of the 200g I ordered - and still charging me the 200g price! I ordered some organic lemons - thery arrived in a pack with a  best before  date of 9th april. Went to use them on the 8th to find two of them totally mouldy. By now I was totally disillusioned  but the icing on the cake was when I decided to check the expiry dates on the rest of my stuff  only to discover that almost everything fresh was ridiculously short-dated. For example brand products which I have bought from other retailers with around 3 weeks in which to use them - and from Asda  with only around 3-5 days! This has made me believe that Asda must be instructing their employees to pick the shortest-dated stuff for their online customers. I complained  of course  and I got a phone call from a very pleasant customer services lady who sorted out refunds for me - but that s not the point. I don t want to be wasting my time in having to check things and complaining. Which is why I shan t be shopping online ith ASDA again. It s back to Tesco for me!					2016-04-09T08:07:37+0000	1460189257	2016-04-09 10:07:37	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	9	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When my boyfriend suggested we buy some pud. I rushed to Tesco to see what was good. With so many vegan choices I couldn t contain my delight. I had to resist the urge to take a bite. I decided to buy them all. So many goodies  what a great haul. But alas it was not to be. One such product upset my glee. Sweet mango with sticky rice. Was really not so nice. At a pricey three pounds fifty. It was certainly not for the thrifty. But after just a little taste. Our two portions in the bin  what a waste! Please take on board my little proclaim. So no other customer has to go through the same!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12994421_661748281762_693391291346482418_n.jpg?oh=5d4282ba8b3b4860b0a9189659080fe0&oe=590B6962	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12994421_661748281762_693391291346482418_n.jpg?oh=614df8f6c58cdf8a5f0ab7d64fc83aca&oe=5922D964	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=661748281762&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-09T06:35:36+0000	1460183736	2016-04-09 08:35:36	19	6	22	0	28	6	5	1	1	0	19	0	0	3	0	0	0

His name was Hugh  he took a long hard look. Asked me to say my date of birth and my full name but was still not happy and said my face on the Garda Age card was more rounded than my face now (which obviously changed after 5 years). He then asked me to show another form of ID. I showed him my driving licence with my photo and he still wasn t convinced that it was me. Never felt so embarrassed in my life. I don t understand how 2 forms of legal documents were turned down when they were clearly valid. It felt like a form of discrimination and it was the worst service i ever experienced at tesco.					2016-04-08T20:55:50+0000	1460148950	2016-04-08 22:55:50	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had completed my shopping and gone to retrieve my £1 from the trolley only to find my £1 had fallen out during my walk around the store. I asked for a duty manager to point out the problem.  Not only did Michael take the time to talk to me he also explained that Tesco know of the problem  how the problem is created and how they have replaced their trolley fleet ad that the me collecting the trollies can replace any lst £1 ad take the trolley out of circulation.  A very helpful man.					2016-04-08T20:50:11+0000	1460148611	2016-04-08 22:50:11	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I felt I should write to you to explain how my world came crashing down around me  whilst ordering our groceries using your obviously incredible online shopping website thing this afternoon. Grab a tissue  this is an emotional one.  The wife and I have been using your home delivery service for proper ages now  as basically we re too lazy to physically go to the shops  and have never had a problem since. Not even when our ordered meat for a small Sunday roast was substituted with a £12 lamb joint the size of New Zealand. We re committed you see  and normally obstacles that we face on the road to stuffing our fridge  freezer  cupboard or face are instantly dismissed and laughed at heartily  especially where Tesco is concerned.  I openly admit that I wrote to you before regarding the stiff caps on your children s yoghurt pouches  (the ones that gave our daughter forearms like Popeye)  but I swept all that under the carpet. All forgotten.  Now  over the past few months I made a tidy discovery in your store. A legend of the freezer department. A revolution in baked curry dishes. A prime piece of pastry perfection. Yep  that s right  I m talking about your awesome Tesco Chicken Madras Bakes. These awesome treats are not only an example of Michelin star food production  but they also come at the bargain price of 99 english pence per 2 bake box. An absolute bargain. Not sure exactly how you re making profit on them  but who am I to complain.   Up until last weekend I had successfully smashed just over 4 000 individual bakes down my neck  and given their high nutritional value  I ve gained around 3 stone in lean muscle thanks to the raw protein intake supplied by the chunks of quality chicken these bakes provide. I owe you a few knuckle taps for that. I have eaten them all day  every day  at home  work and in bed.  Anyway  earlier today I was browsing said amazing grocery site  excited to order my favourite baked Indian cuisine  but to my horror  it said that you don t sell them anymore.   I know  mental isn t it.   At first I thought this could be some kind of belated April Fool s joke  but I soon realised that s not your style. You re no fools  but then again  you would be to give up on such an amazing invention. If you ve tried them yourself then you re probably as shocked as me. If you haven t  then I really do feel for you.  My freezer  my balanced diet  my mood  my marriage  my job  and my ability to purchase the finest in Madras-based pastry products are all affected by your decision to cull my beloved Chicken Madras Bakes  and I was wondering  aside from explaining the real reason for the axe  if there is anything you can do for me as compensation for such heartache  as I find this situation more upsetting than the end of Marley & Me.  Thanks in advance  and indeed for the now sadly unavailable Tesco Chicken Madras Bakes.  Much love and all that jazz  Dave					2016-04-08T20:37:31+0000	1460147851	2016-04-08 22:37:31	59	10	73	21	104	10	10	0	43	0	59	1	0	12	0	0	0

What amazing customer experience I ve just had at Bradley Stoke Superstore (store no. 5652).  My dad had sadly passed away and had 6 unopened spindles of blank Tesco branded DVDs. I didn t have any receipts or proof of purchase  so I thought I d popped into this store and explained the situation.   Mohammed Qureshi was very understanding and wanted to be able to help. He did have to check and he spoke to his manager Paul Waspe who agreed not only for me to be allowed to bring the DVDs back  but for me to be given a full refund!!   I was so taken aback by this amazing offer after leaving the customer service desk....I cried. I was quite emotional anyway as these discs were bought by my dad and I had kind of expected it to be a  no !  This is what you call Customer Service. A BIG thank you to Mohammed and Paul for not  following the usual rules for refunds  and  putting the customer first .					2016-04-08T19:26:06+0000	1460143566	2016-04-08 21:26:06	27	4	29	0	33	4	2	2	3	0	27	1	1	0	0	0	0

I called the Electrical Helpline and I have told by them to take photos with the faulty TV which I ve done it and I emailed to TTS.BST@UK.TESCO.COM a week ago with regards to a faulty product with my details like name  phone number  post code and no reply from them. The local Tesco store told me that I have to sort it out on my own  they can t help me with.  Can somebody help/advise me to sort it out  what to do  where to go... Thank you in advance.

On the phone you just told me to have fresher food my groceries need to be delivered in the morning. Can you point me to where  on your website  it informs me of this?

My ordered was cancelled last Monday as the driver couldn t access the property. A refund should have been made to me by now  it hadn t so I contacted customer services who have processed the refund today (apparently the first refund was rejected) NOW..... please tell me why I should have to wait 10 days!! for a refund for goods that I never even received??  Pleased I can afford to wait for the refund but what would have happened should the customer need that money now.??					2016-04-08T10:46:54+0000	1460112414	2016-04-08 12:46:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The first time in the morning  so when I saw veg with a best before date of 6th April I was surprised but guessed it was because it was the morning. I then went back in the afternoon about 5 ish and was shocked to see baking potatoes with best before 5th April on and bags of Cauliflower and broccoli with 6th April on. Do staff know how to rotate stock properly?  Now I know I shouldn t be surprised but I ve just opened a prepacked salad best before 9th April that I bought on one of my visits that day and the pepper in it is already mouldy. I ve added pictures as this is not the first time it s happened  usually I kindly mention it to a member of staff but I am starting to wonder what s the point as it never improves  I actually think it s getting worse with very short shelf life on alot of fruit and veg.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12985434_10156694949115468_8252907214014796937_n.jpg?oh=15afccc20e1229009f23c489eb3e3c22&oe=58DAD6ED	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12985434_10156694949115468_8252907214014796937_n.jpg?oh=1a012bb226f327732784bbf86ce7356a&oe=5924B4E0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156694949115468&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-08T10:41:54+0000	1460112114	2016-04-08 12:41:54	1	6	1	0	7	5	3	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We use the size 5 ultra dry for our son and they were the best nappies I had found. But since the last packet we used  they are less absorbant  they don t seem to stay in place very well and he has had nappy rash which he has never ever had since he was born.  It just seems odd to me that almost everyone I know used to rave about your nappies  myself included. But these new ones are just terrible! I wonder if whoever is behind this change  actually even uses these nappies. Why fix something that isn t broken?!					2016-04-08T09:57:59+0000	1460109479	2016-04-08 11:57:59	3	11	3	0	14	11	10	1	7	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Although the fence has now been fixed it has taken 2 months for that to happen and the the people doing the work cancelled twice and did not turn up once. Meaning I had to stay in and wait for them for no reason.  The accident happened in the evening whilst I was desperately trying to get my 2 month year old son to sleep  it made an almighty bang and woke him up  I then had the delivery driver (a stranger) in my house for 2 hours trying to sort out the incident.  Therefore I could not get my son back to sleep.  I am a new single mum and had the security of my property compromised for 2 months and not to mention that evening as well.  And to add insult to injury when I have tried to order my shopping online with you it says my address is not recognised  so how did someone down my road get theirs delivered???? I am still waiting on as much as an apology from Tesco.  Very disappointed					2016-04-08T09:10:48+0000	1460106648	2016-04-08 11:10:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t know what you have changed about them but I am not happy one bit. I have another 2 packets of these nappies to use and I really don t want to. They re not even lasting 3 hours during the day without splitting too. My twins are only just in the weight category for the size 5s and this is happening. It s an absolute joke.

I understand you can t prevent your fish from having zero bones but this was a joke.. One fillet was riddled with tiny bones throughout and I ended up swallowing one and it got lodged in my throat. I ended up having to leave work at lunchtime to go to a&e to have it looked at... Several cameras down my throat later and I was home left with an exceptionally sore throat from it being cut many times by the bone that got stuck feeling rather drained by the whole experience and having to take tomorrow off work as well. Majorly disappointed more care needs to be taken with these things ... I was lucky and it didn t have any affect on my breathing but it could for someone else.					2016-04-07T22:51:25+0000	1460069485	2016-04-08 00:51:25	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did my shoppping tonight and picked up items well aware I could get them cheaper up the road for convenience (eg 2 litre dr pepper 1.80 odd in your store and 1 in Asda) I read the sign at the checkout saying 10 items so made sure I had ten different items to qualify. In actual fact I even had ten branded items. When it came to the checkout needless to say no money was knocked off. So I was scammed into buying more to make sure I qualified and then diddled out the difference between what the cheaper shops charge. And on the same note your fuel prices which once were competitive with asda are now always a penny dearer. No loyalty to your customers. Will be staying loyal to Asda in future. And had it not been gone half ten at night would have had a good mind to abandon the shopping and do it at asda!					2016-04-07T21:58:37+0000	1460066317	2016-04-07 23:58:37	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

By 8.30pm it hadn t arrived so I called customer services. A very helpful lady looked into the issue and said the delivery driver had tried and failed to deliver at 7.03pm  and had left a card. I can assure you both my husband and I were in at that time and in fact  I had been in the house all day. The doorbell works and there is a door that can be knocked on too. No card was left nor was any delivery attempted at my house. The customer services lady then contacted the delivery driver on our behalf who said he d try again at the end of his other deliveries and that she d call back at 9.30pm to see if we had received our groceries. At 9.30pm I got my call  from a man at the depot this time  who said they were organising another driver to meet the original one  collect our order and deliver it to us. Great  we thought  only two hours late but at least it s on its way. 10.10pm and we were still waiting for our order so I called the man back to see how things were going. This time I was told they can t deliver and will bring it tomorrow instead.  It is way past my bedtime  Tesco  and I wish this had been the solution originally rather than making me wait up all this time. Would I still be waiting now  had I not made that phone call? Now I sincerely hope  Tesco  that 1) I will not incur another delivery charge  since I understand that is the practice if the customer misses their original delivery slot  as I was actually at home at 7.03pm and 2) my delivery does indeed arrive tomorrow.  Yours faithfully  a tired customer.					2016-04-07T21:22:18+0000	1460064138	2016-04-07 23:22:18	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I drink Pepsi Cola Max and have noticed that Tesco have three  offers  that they continually rotate.Standard price £1.98 for a 2 litre bottle ( which is nearly as expensive as a motorway) then either half price at 99p   which it is now or any 2 for £2.00.Why oh why do you do this when a discounter such as B&M can do it all or most of the time for 99p.A little honesty wouldn t go amiss with things such as this - even a convenience store I use sells it for £1.69 so your £1.98 is a bit over the top.					2016-04-07T18:27:36+0000	1460053656	2016-04-07 20:27:36	2	10	2	0	12	9	3	6	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My sons were born 13 months apart. I use your ultra dry for my eldest son and super fit for my youngest  purely because they are different colours and at a glance I know who s is who. I ve never really thought there was much else different with them  and always been more than pleased. However.... What have you done to the ultra dry ones now??? For the last month or so they really have been diabolical. They don t absorb half as much as they used to  and what they do absorb clumps instead of expands. The sticky pads don t stick as well and the material that they are made from now is too stretchy and the nappy just falls off! The times over the last month my son has wet through when the nappy is hardly wet is rediculous. I m now having to to buy my nappies from elsewhere... Very inconvenient as I do my online shopping with you and it s so much easier to get my nappies with you too being a bully item. What s happened tesco..?					2016-04-07T17:34:53+0000	1460050493	2016-04-07 19:34:53	1	5	1	0	6	5	3	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I cut open the pack of chicken breasted (dated 8.04.16) they were off. I went to my local store at Knocknagoney. At customer services I was refunded the cost after queuing for 5 minutes. I then had to go and get more chicken and queue at a check out.  It wasn t until I got into the car to drive home again I thought about the fact that I hadn t even received an apology. My dinner is now late and family are hungry. Disappointed :-(					2016-04-07T16:57:32+0000	1460048252	2016-04-07 18:57:32	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  today I was made to feel extremely embarrassed by a member of staff in the Littlehampton main store in front of my four children and members of the public. I would normally brush off insulting behaviour but not when I am giving someone my custom and especially in front of my family.I know very well that people can be judgmental  having a large amount of children but as I teach my young  looks can be very deceiving. Never judge a book by its cover   that sort of thing! The lady in question (I have her name and job title for my written complaint) approach my family whilst we were trying the Lynx spray ( see picture below) and rudely asked us not to spray the deodorant and put it back or pay for it  with follow up remarks such as  I m sick and tired of people like you! .  Really? It actually stated  TRY ME  on the display!! It was only a month ago that I raised over £3.5 K in the Havant Superstore in support of a local charity for disabled veterans. We were hosted extremely well for which I was extremely grateful. Perhaps the Littlehampton store should take note! Customer relations are very important.  Admin   if you are interested I can pass on the member of staff involved  complete with pictures.

I purchased a My Little Pony Equestria Girl Mini doll from your North Harbour store in Portsmouth today. Since my daughter opening it and playing for around 2 hours  one of the dolls legs has fallen off! (She has another doll bought previously and same thing happened  so obviously a faulty product.. I am in contact with Hasbro also) is there anything you can do?					2016-04-07T16:14:37+0000	1460045677	2016-04-07 18:14:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have the receipt from Tesco which says the card has been activated  however when I go to Debenhams they say it has not been activated and will not allow me to use it. I have tried talking with both Tesco and Debenhams to get the money rightfully put onto the card that my friend paid for  and neither million £ company is any help at all in rectifying the situation by putting a small amount of money onto the card it should already be on. Both companies are pinning it on the other and have given me appalling customer service all round. Not impressed.					2016-04-07T15:59:19+0000	1460044759	2016-04-07 17:59:19	3	11	3	1	15	11	4	7	4	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can you please tell me if you ve changed the recipe of your own-brand cat food? I ve always bought the Tesco Cuts Mixed Selection for my three. I noticed it was temporarily unavailable for a while last month  and when it reappeared on the shelves there had been a revamp and the box had changed shape. Have the ingredients also changed? None of my cats will eat it now. Really disappointed as it was great value and they loved it before.

I ordered something online for my sons birthday because  it was guaranteed to be there  in time however if was not delivered until 4 days after.  If I had known that it would not be delivered on time I would have ordered from elsewhere. I am thoroughly disappointed as this is not the first time. What makes it more annoying and heartbreaking is letting my 9 year old son down on his birthday. As way of goodwill I was offered £20  which I just don t think is good enough. As your staff member from customer care team told me she believed £20 was adequate compensation. Let me ask you. Would you be happy with this service? Because I can assure you £20 doesn t even come close to making up for the upset caused by Tesco to my son on his birthday. I look forward to your response.

Upon being seated we were told there were no highchairs available as they only had 3. For a busy cafe to only have 3 highchairs is ridiculous and my 15 month old daughter had to start eating her sausage dinner in her buggy which isn t acceptable.   My mum ordered a cheese and pickle sandwich and queued to order it. The chef slapped 2 dry slices of bread on a plate then dolloped on a ladle of some disgusting looking substance using the same ladle he d dished up hot dinners with (see attached photo).   I ordered a salad bowl and was charged £2.95. When I asked where I got the salad from I was shown 4 bowls - one with coleslaw  one with soggy kidney beans in water  one with tomato and one with wet  soggy couscous. I asked where the lettuce  cucumber etc were and I was told that s all they had. I got a refund in the end as to charge that much for a salad and to offer 4 bowls of soggy food is unacceptable.   I will definitely not be returning to eat here again and am very disappointed with the service  the food and the presentation. No care was taken in preparing a nice cheese sandwich  the salad on offer was poor quality and the selection was awful.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12961645_10156733929765405_1040390383368227331_n.jpg?oh=08e4f9becd3e2637ae278795315bd4b8&oe=58DA3D30	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12961645_10156733929765405_1040390383368227331_n.jpg?oh=1afd709d4b9bf31cd21d28fa731caa73&oe=58DD7E3D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156733929765405&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-07T13:49:30+0000	1460036970	2016-04-07 15:49:30	2	10	2	0	12	10	7	3	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have shopped with tesco for years and spending £300 a week.  Disgusting.  I now have a family with no feed this evening so off to another supermarket I go					2016-04-07T13:22:07+0000	1460035327	2016-04-07 15:22:07	0	9	0	0	9	9	7	2	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So fed up of not being able to get a space and then seeing people getting out of the car with either no children or 8/9/10 year olds! Ashford  Park Farm is also becoming a joke with the amount of cars that park on the thatched markings at the end of the spaces. I managed to get a end parent and child space and then had a car park in thatched markings so couldn t get the baby in that side.  Thanks.

I attended your Pontardawe store around lunch time on Thursday 31st March and would like to say thank you for the great customer service I received. This what happened:- It was my daughter s 5th birthday in 2 days so I had to go shopping for food for her birthday party and had to take my 2 children with me (age 2 and 4 at the time). Shopping with children can be stressful at the best of times  let alone when you have something important like a party to plan for. I had already been to 2 shops previously to visiting your Pontardawe store and had been out of the house with my children for 3 hours already so by this point I was slowly losing my patience and they were understandably bored. My son had started to throw a temper tantrum in the trolley and was screaming  I had a few looks off people judging me  who obviously didn t know the whole story. This wasn t what Peter did instead he asked my son what was the matter. And although my son didn t answer  he immediately stopped crying  which broke the tension. Peter was very friendly and carried on interacting with both of my children and by the time we walked away my children were much happier. At the time I didn t thank Peter as I was very stressed and in my own little world. I then proceeded to the self service checkout while I was scanning my items Gerry was talking to my children and kept them amused while I finished scanning my items. This is when I realised I should have thanked Peter for his earlier intervention. By the time I left your store I was much less stressed and my children were in a better mood too  which is very unusual for a shopping trip with children. People are very quick to complain (myself included) but forget to say thank you for good service. Peter and Gerry provided exceptional customer service and what may not have seemed like a big deal to them made a huge difference to my day!					2016-04-07T10:05:17+0000	1460023517	2016-04-07 12:05:17	15	3	15	0	18	3	1	2	0	0	14	0	0	0	0	0	0

I started happily chomping away at a packet of your finest  Roasted Salted Pistachios  when all of a sudden this thing showed up. I don t know what it is but it had hollowed out the pistachio and started to grow...Now I am not an idiot and know you can t have someone go about and open every pistachio to check it is not infested but there is obviously a Health issue here.   Thankfully it fell out as I normally chuck these thing straight from the shell to mouth.  I think I will stick to cashews from asda from now on...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12919644_10153562638356989_6081142373898322638_n.jpg?oh=c3f7cdb71818956c583ae5f6587fd8c8&oe=5908C606	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12919644_10153562638356989_6081142373898322638_n.jpg?oh=2a864118eee820701dc74af859ae3157&oe=58DA360B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153562638356989&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-07T09:41:00+0000	1460022060	2016-04-07 11:41:00	4	23	5	0	28	23	8	15	17	0	4	0	0	0	0	1	0

I have seen numerous vans in the area and funnily ebough they crates are still sitting there!  They are causing an obstruction and it s a busy road.  It won t be long before they end up in the road and/or full of rubbish.

We as a family love tiger bread toast and thought we d buy some this week  afterall its picked fresh on the day we order for so what could go wrong?! So our order turned up this morning and i spy the tiger bread peaking out the crate. However  once the shopping is all loaded in the crate and the drivers on his way we spy said tiger bread looking like this (please see the photo on the left!)  Now tiger bread should have that distinct smell and look to it as well as be fresh this morning - now imagine our horror when its only half a tiger bread  smells like regular bread  best before is today  its soft like a loaf of bread and doesnt smell tigerish either.   Is there a reason your only making a half a tiger bread now? We are most disapointed and would like our money back please - we ordered a full tiger bread bloomer  not an imposter   Thanks	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12928269_10153957389807209_2033020385144047174_n.jpg?oh=440c6b1fafc3741168d2ffad7a14bd01&oe=591BE14D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12928269_10153957389807209_2033020385144047174_n.jpg?oh=c85d2b847ece9a2e197ab2980cdb8f19&oe=5923C340	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153957389807209&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-07T08:32:03+0000	1460017923	2016-04-07 10:32:03	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We were asked to take photos of the  blurr   which we did and to send them to an email address given to us over the phone. We heard nothing from you  so we rang again. We were then told they had not received any photos. This was possibility because we had sent too many photos  so could we send just two! This we did. Since then we have emailed to ask what is happening as its been along time since we contacted you. And guess what no reply still. The TV was bought in October so it s still under guarantee. We just want a reply please. Unsatisfactory and incredibly bad customer service. Kind regards Unhappy customers.					2016-04-06T18:33:28+0000	1459967608	2016-04-06 20:33:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He is an utter embarrassment to your company   and unless I get an appropriate response from you   I may be forced to go and deal with this myself! STEVEN his name is. Extremely gaunt   unhealthy looking  man . My Son was in the store with his Girlfriend and his Mum. He picked up an item and made a joke to his Mum about it   no more   no less. With that   Steven very rudely tells my Son that if he continues to  muck about  he should leave the store. Hearing this my Wife confronted him   to ask what on earth was he doing talking to our Son like this?  his response was sarcastic  rude and offensive   patronisingly calling her  love  and acting as if he had done nothing wrong. I appreciate you may get some toe rags in the shop at times   especially in the school holidays. But to embarrass my Son and patronise my Wife   just for having a laugh with each other is frankly disgusting customer service and he is extremely lucky I haven t stormed straight back down there to advise him on his obvious lack of customer service skills. He is a total embarrassment to your company  and makes a mockery of your selection process.  Please advise me on what to do next with this complaint   because believe me   I won t let anyone else put up with this kind of embarrassment in your store.  Awaiting your prompt response.

Perhaps it s the horrendously rude staff at the self serve area  perhaps it s the people at the pizza counter who tell you to wait 15 mins for a pizza because they want to make several pizzas to fill the shelf before bothering to serve the customer standing in front of them or perhaps it s because of the many incorrect shelf labels that are out and when you tell the till staff what the shelf price was they tell you that your wrong when your not!!!  I absolutely hate Tesco Bathgate. I think I will be driving that little bit further to go to morrisons from now on and that includes the petrol station. I don t think the people who work in that shop would know customer service of it smacked them in the face.

One of your drivers stopped to check and see that I was ok and the offending driver drove on. I realise that this is testament more to the driver personally than your company but if by any tiny chance he sees this I d like to say thanks. His van was obviously branded and he s a credit to your company. Thanks.					2016-04-06T15:49:58+0000	1459957798	2016-04-06 17:49:58	4	5	4	0	9	5	2	3	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly I just want to say THANK YOU for acknowledging the need for a more diverse range of free from foods. But I need to ask 2 questions- 1) why does the majority still contain egg!???  2) you make a own brand digestive that is free from everything  yet the chocolate version contains MILK chocolate! You make an own brand free from chocolate- why not put this chocolate on the biscuit?? It defies logic to me! You would make my 3yr old and many others happy if you could address this. I await your response!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12523844_10156787617335644_5365154921625929539_n.jpg?oh=14b2f5806fd57a88f282aa6fd3240e1a&oe=59126A2E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12523844_10156787617335644_5365154921625929539_n.jpg?oh=3f0ba5dbb3b93dcce0641466f64d4348&oe=591D5A23	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156787617335644&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-06T13:47:44+0000	1459950464	2016-04-06 15:47:44	6	20	6	0	26	20	7	13	11	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

She wanted to get it from Tesco s as she wanted to use her clubcard vouchers. My adress would not show up which was expected. Now i was told by HOTPOINT that all Tescos would have to do is email them with the CORRECT adress. A managaer from TESCO had also told me this last week when i complained about you mucking my order up! My mum had £100 in vouchers to spend and is now just as angry with TESCO as me! I havent shopped in there since they mucked my order up and to be honest i dont even think youve looked into the complaint i made. TESCO REALLY NEEDS TO TRAIN ITS STAFF SO EVERYONE SINGS FROM THE SAME HYN SHEET! Everyone says different!

I felt for a healthy snack to munch on whilst at work so i went to get some fruit and your Black seedless grapes caught my eye. Picked out a tray that wasn t moldy  manky and all of the above. So i start eating my way through them and notice an earthy taste to it and then noticed that them. Hidden in these grapes there in fact were seeds and now i question if i can trust buying fruit from Tesco again. I am carefully removing these seeds before consumption like some form of fruit surgeon and gathering quite the pile. Tesco  this isn t over.

I have spent e best part of an hour trying to find out the weight guides for you tesco nappies. I have A baby in size 3 nappies but he is a big baby and at times first thing in the morning  he can be damp! I m not sure if this is due to a his nappy or whether or not he is just sweating at night. He was weighed today at 17lb 4ozs and he is only 4 months. please can you send me the weight guides for 3 and 4 tesco economy nappies.  Many thanks.  It maybe worth putting the weight guides on the nappy description for the online grocery service. Saves a lot of time for us mums.

I wanted to buy a drink yesterday and I was not allowed to because the assistant considered that I look under 25 and I had to show my ID card. When I did so  she told me that it is not accepted and I had to carry my passport in order to get a bottle of wine!  First and foremost  I have a Tesco club card which confirms my age (24). Secondly  I use my ID card to travel all over the EU  I am a EU citizen and according to the EU legislation I can do so ( Regulation EC No 562/2006). Thirdly  I showed all my student cards (I am a PhD student  which I think proves I am over 18) and my bank cards  via which I order online every time  including alcohol. I think that it is vey unfair that I can order online without showing any passport documents but on the other hand I cannot buy a product on my own in a supermarket. Finally  I also had my EU health card  which has my date of birth on it  as all the previous documents. As you can imagine I was really upset and this is so subjective  as I am living in Ireland for 14 months and never had I such an issue on buying products  including Tesco.   I am really disappointed on this behaviour  which is unjustified. I also complained in the customer service but the problem was not solved. I do not really know what is the solution  but I would really appreciate it if I did not have to argue in the supermarket everytime I need to get a product.  I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter as soon as possible.  Kind regards					2016-04-06T09:27:59+0000	1459934879	2016-04-06 11:27:59	1	11	1	0	12	10	2	8	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My cat ate every scrap before  but now licks the jelly off and leaves the meat. The meat used to be in small chunks  now it is flat chunks. There is no point me buying it to throw away  as he won t even eat it if he is hungry. 😕					2016-04-06T09:20:33+0000	1459934433	2016-04-06 11:20:33	1	9	1	0	10	9	5	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tried it with my dog who loved it so took my £1 voucher which came with it to my local tesco Ullapool to buy more and guess what they don t sell it! Why did you send it out when I can t buy? My next closest tesco who do stock it is dingwall which is an hour away. Total waste of time and money. Once again you really need to look at who your targeting tesco.

My daughter was screaming so I had to carry her. When I arrived at the checkout the assistant and another member of customer services ran around to help me unload the trolley. The assistant then handed some bits the my son to play with whilst she scanned and packed all of my bags for me- even offering to help me out to the car. Am very  very grateful.

Sent a complaint at the beginning of March regarding a Hudl. They agreed to refund £30. Completed a BACS form on the 7th March  chased it up on the 17th March to be told that I had missed a digit and to phone. I phoned and got a very rude man who told me that he couldn t take any bank details over the phone and I had to fill in another form  which I did. The error I had made the first time was actually due to the form not allowing 0 to be the first digit  so I wrote this on my email. Was told in an automated reply that it would take 10 working days. Nothing happened so I sent an email  no reply. Asked through private message on here  and was told you had checked and it was going to be 14 working days which was today. Nothing in my account so I sent another message only to be told you have no record of my form being returned  despite being told last week that my 14 days was up on the 6th. Where did that info come from if you have no record of my form !!!					2016-04-06T08:25:48+0000	1459931148	2016-04-06 10:25:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am very grateful for their help and can not thank them enough.  I have also received a call to tell me that my parcel is now ready for collection and all items have been checked and counted for.

We regularly use Tesco delivery/click & collect as our main supermarket for our weekly shop and we are never disappointed. Until now.  This is a  fresh  boneless shoulder of pork which we purchased and cooked correctly as per instructions. When my partner went to carve the pork  he noticed the pork was still pink all the way through so I put it back in the oven for a further half hour. Half an hour passed  by this point the pork had been in the oven for just over 3 hours and 15 minutes. Upon inspection when carving  again  still extremely pink  then we discovered throughout the entire shoulder there was a mouldlike substance oozing through the meat and the smell was enough to make us nauseous. Not only that  but the texture of the pork was horrendous  slimy and gooey with a God awful smell.   In addition  before we put the pork back in for the extra half hour  I removed the cracking for us to graze on  and whilst nibbling we noticed very quickly this had long thick slimy black strands.   What are you going to do Tesco??	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/944924_10208348867215242_5884311125366778590_n.jpg?oh=330a50ff9b75cc41683a7f6ac9405da6&oe=59122B70	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/944924_10208348867215242_5884311125366778590_n.jpg?oh=d87f517693fa21921d3eef81694dab5e&oe=58D89A8F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208348867215242&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-06T00:37:18+0000	1459903038	2016-04-06 02:37:18	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now it s Maynards Bassets brand sport mixture stocked and no Lions. The Maynards are no where near as good and haves no licorice flavours sweets. Why are your Lions brand sweets no longer stocked? You have replaced them with a poor imitation and it s really disappointing.

To make things worse I was in Paris and had all of my boarding passes saved on my phone so this little lead caused a great deal of upset! And then to make things worse I went in to store for a refund this Sunday gone and was pretty much accused of breaking it myself which I fail to comprehend - why would I break something I desperately need?! Regardless  I have now gone back to uni and the nearest big Tesco is forty minutes away so I would really appreciate if this can just be sorted online or over the phone.

When I passed the bakery aisle  a member of staff was loading a large amount of baguettes (and presumably then other baked goods) into red bin bags labelled  not fit for human consumption . Given the amount there (already almost filled a 2nd bag and still a lot of bread on the shelves) i wondered if this  waste  actually just goes straight into a bin? Given that I m sure it can t have been on sale for longer than a day or 2  I hardly imagine it s  not fit for human consumption  (I certainly keep freshly baked bread for a few days and it s still perfectly edible) the level of waste this must create concerns me given that there are so many people homeless and/or hungry who would benefit from these items. To see this and then see a collection box for food bank donations near the tills at the store seems to me a complete contradiction?! Also I can t imagine I d be best impressed had I been about to buy a baguette to see that my full priced baguettes neighbour was being labelled not fit for human consumption 😂					2016-04-05T20:35:17+0000	1459888517	2016-04-05 22:35:17	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  we went to Launceston branch today and popped in for a coffee at the Costa outlet while we waited for our tyres to be changed just across the road. We paid & collected our hot chocolate and cake and went to find a vacant table. There were lots of vacant tables but every one of them had uncollected dirty dishes on! The manager was more concerned with people waiting for food  so we cleared our own table and added our tray to the pile on the cill by the window! The whole time we were there  he flitted about like a demented thing and only when we were ready to leave did someone come out and start clearing the tables. As a management consultant and past owner of my own tea shop  I was appalled that someone who is supposed to be a manager  had no idea how to prioritise his work to ensure not only the tables were cleared  but the food was also served. I suggest you speak to the francise company and get them to sort it. It does Tesco no favours to have dirty and scruffy tables on show from the front door and those walking through to the loos.					2016-04-05T18:04:14+0000	1459879454	2016-04-05 20:04:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On Monday the 4 th April 2016  I drove past tesco litherland in my mums car  an noticed and noticed on your main sign that the price of petrol was £1.01.9 and diesel was £1.02.9. I then drove into tesco and on the other 2 signs you have in there it said £1.01.9 for petrol and £10.1.9 for diesel. I was very confused and as I have autism it made me even more confused. I made my mum drive round again later that day to check and I was pleased that you had fixed your signs. Thanks Noah aged 9.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/1916380_10153469469742314_9028554174282446996_n.jpg?oh=928a923d749bbd1118aac67ad4a3ea7b&oe=590B5B4B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1916380_10153469469742314_9028554174282446996_n.jpg?oh=bb704b6ed574075b915e85928bbe9880&oe=58D6605E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153469469742314&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-05T17:17:43+0000	1459876663	2016-04-05 19:17:43	19	15	21	0	36	15	1	14	13	0	19	2	0	0	0	0	0

I understand that some may not survive the night but surely they should survive 24hrs without rotting.  If these grapes are going to be prone to rotting so quickly  then I may as well spend the extra buying your own branded grapes and getting more than 24 hrs out of them.					2016-04-05T15:32:25+0000	1459870345	2016-04-05 17:32:25	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I checked the bacon and found FOUR pieces of bone in his measly two pieces of bacon. The worst thing is the biggest piece of bone is so sharp if he was to have swallowed that I honestly dread to think what could have happened. This is absolutely DISGRACEFUL.

I contacted Hotpoint two and a half months ago and was assured that I would receive a date for an engineer to visit within 8 weeks. It was hard enough to get in contact with Hotpoint as they don t answer their phone lines. Needless to say  Hotpoint failed to get in contact with me to arrange the engineer. As my dryer was purchased from Tesco Direct  I also contacted them to express my concerns about the dangerous dryer over 6 weeks ago. I was informed that I would be passed to a customer service agent who would be in contact with me within 24 hours. This never happened. I feel very disappointed that Tesco and Hotpoint appear to be acting in a negligent way towards their customers. Neither company appears to be taking responsibility for the products they are producing/selling.					2016-04-05T11:46:32+0000	1459856792	2016-04-05 13:46:32	1	8	1	0	9	7	4	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I rang customer services at 12.15 to find out where it was & the poor lad couldn t get hold of the driver  the store  or the duty manager. In fact at one point someone answered but immediately hung up on him. I do now have my shopping but what s the point in me  the customer  contacting customer services when all other points of contact are avoiding their calls? Poor.					2016-04-05T11:33:26+0000	1459856006	2016-04-05 13:33:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why do you not care about customer service?  As a treat I purchased two Tesco s packet Finest steaks only to find some disgusting  filthy animal working for you had cut a slice into the fillet steak and stuffed a chewed up piece of mint gum before packaging with the obvious intention someone would eat it and assume is a bit of chewy fat.  I filled in your online form around 5 days ago  giving you a chance to try make this right  but you have ignored me. I then sent you a direct email 24 hours ago.

I m quite concerned about the sudden significant changes to the nutritional information of your Feta and Slow Roast Tomato Pasta (290g). Until recently  the pack was described as containing 365kcal  however this seems to have shot up to 531kcal  almost 200kcal more per pack. While I understand products are reformulated  this is a very big difference and the product does not seem to have changed. Please can you explain why this label information has changed - was the label previously wrong? Many thanks for your time.					2016-04-05T07:32:58+0000	1459841578	2016-04-05 09:32:58	9	4	9	0	13	4	3	1	4	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

Not only were all the staff extremely attentive  genuinely concerned and really helpful but they also took the time to follow up with her today and hand deliver these beautiful flowers. Thankfully my mother is well and will be fine after a little rest and has asked me to pass on her thanks. As I mentioned all the staff were brilliant during the situation however  a special big thank you to Emma Johnson the first aid contact on shift and Karen the fresh food lead manager. You were both amazing and your level of compassion was extremely impressive.

Whilst shopping at your Horwich store today  I came across the new Willow Farm meat range. £1.89 for two chicken breasts? I m curious as to how you can charge so little for them? I saw that the packaging bore the Red Tractor logo  indicating that the meat has been reared and slaughtered to specific standards...could you elaborate on these standards please?   Many thanks!					2016-04-04T20:38:33+0000	1459802313	2016-04-04 22:38:33	0	9	0	0	9	8	4	4	8	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Maybe it s because they sit there looking so plump and delicious and I m subconsciously imagining how lovely they must taste. Unfortunately  the reality is quite different. I have NEVER had a good mango from Tesco  yet I still keep buying them. Maybe it s for the same reason that I buy a lottery ticket occasionally- that vague hope that one day I might just get lucky and hit the jackpot. To be honest though  I d probably feel as if I had struck gold were I to be fortunate enough to buy a mango that actually has yellow flesh. To find one that isn t fibrous  has yellow flesh and a delicious sweet flavour seems to be against all odds. Tonight s mango looked so gorgeous  but was once again a massive anti-climax. As soon as I stuck the knife in  I realised once more that I d been a complete plonker to buy another Tesco mango. If I d never tasted a decent mango before then I d assume that they re meant to taste like this and never buy one again. Tonight s specimen is brown almost all the way through  tastes rather unpleasantly bitter and is more fibrous than a doormat. I ve taken a photograph of it for you to see. Does your buyer actually know what a mango is meant to taste like? Perhaps they should pop across to Waitrose. I ve never had a bad mango from Waitrose. They ve always been delicious.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/s130x130/1918098_1607765606210744_6737996230478071497_n.jpg?oh=ae16f636674cb806fdcb306651d73a22&oe=5907353B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q82/s720x720/1918098_1607765606210744_6737996230478071497_n.jpg?oh=10a923b071778ecb01717bfab345cefd&oe=59221FD1	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1607765606210744&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-04T20:23:12+0000	1459801392	2016-04-04 22:23:12	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Was led to believe I would get a replacement. Now they are saying not. After a number of DMs via Twitter  and asking for this in writing so I can take it to Trading Standards  they have gone all  radio silence . Perhaps it s time to take the TV back to the Handforth branch and make my feelings known in person.  Tesco  removing my earlier post doesn t hide the fact that you are escaping your obligations after I was led by your staff member to believe that I was going to get a replacement TV. In addition  Julian told me over the phone that I could have a replacement  yet unsurprisingly  you no longer have this phone call on your system!  Oh  and in response to your comment on my previous post  below  it was a Twitter link. To a photo. You could see it was Twitter. You could see it was a photo. Anyhoo  since the link is an issue  here s the photo. Based on your comments  you have no problem with that.   We do not allow links to non-Tesco sites as we cannot guarantee the content of those sites.

Today I cut into a pepper and the attached photo shows you what I found. I am absolutely disgusted at the quality of the produce I have received. I am also upset and angry as I had already sent my fiancée back to the store on Saturday to swap the bananas we had ordered as the skins were black and soft on each of the bananas. Not only this but I already made a complaint to you about a recent order (dated 11th March)  when are Tesco going to get it right again? Up until the order on the 11th March  I have always been very happy with the service and quality of my purchases but more recently I have been appalled and let down. If this continues to happen I will be forced to take my custom elsewhere.  I look forward to hearing your response promptly.

I absolutely hate waste! Would it not be better to give those items away rather than bin them? Perhaps local nursing homes or homeless shelters? Ok it s not as nutritional as giving them fruit and veg but we all like a sweet treat!!! Such a shame that such large amount of food go to waste!

I ve seen that you now stock gluten free garlic bread and dough balls online. However  all the Drayton store have is gluten free pizza and sausages. The range has decreased and has been replaced by an array of frozen veg. I m all for veg (I m vegan) but it would be nice to have more variety of Free From products.					2016-04-04T19:16:57+0000	1459797417	2016-04-04 21:16:57	2	5	2	0	7	5	2	3	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

My little boy aged 2 tripped over a broken billiard in the car park. This has been like that for ages! (Ask any regular or staff member as it s at the front door) So he was wet as he landed in a puddle his dad put him on his shoulders as we were just going in to get a toy. On our way to the tills I had to scream at his dad as a cable was wrapping around his neck and a TV was about to fall on my head! I stayed where the danger was and my partner went to get manger after at least 8mins they appeared to say  it shouldn t be like this  never asked how my wee boy was or nothing! I spend a lot of money in tesco but I feel it s not safe anymore!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/934133_1322880981061160_1944033112688155547_n.jpg?oh=cfdc79fa9065f9dd683690fb0b189290&oe=592418AD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/934133_1322880981061160_1944033112688155547_n.jpg?oh=b471c6e48e72a30ab6e78799a6659d8d&oe=59183F5A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1322880981061160&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-04T19:10:42+0000	1459797042	2016-04-04 21:10:42	4	21	12	10	43	20	10	10	22	0	4	0	1	0	0	7	0

I promptly booked mine yesterday when I heard the news and just as I expected  the drivers turned up on time and politely carried the shopping through to my kitchen  doing Tesco proud as expected!

I was using their phone to sort out a mistake with my bill (my mistake) and my toddler got a bit annoyed about me not giving him my undivided attention. So that I could speak to the customer service team without him disturbing me  one of your staff members disappeared and returned with one of the fake iPhones for my son to play with. That was it  he d made a new best friend then  having a pretend phone conversation. It really relaxed me as I was panicking he was going to bolt out the front door. So thanks again Tesco 😊.					2016-04-04T18:57:22+0000	1459796242	2016-04-04 20:57:22	3	1	3	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Initially I thought  oh that s good giving the farmers some credit. Then I noticed a flaw  please can you tell me where Nightingale Farm is? As you can see from the attached photos  one product is from Senegal and the other from Spain but both supplied by the same farm? Is this some form of publicity stunt or to try and make your produce more desirable to the consumer? Essentially you are conning us in to thinking we are buying from Nightingale Farm  when essentially it is just a fictitious place??	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12718007_10156672395185526_3944694245101336925_n.jpg?oh=07a370e7bd7379ae9d98f3539b12c65c&oe=58DB02A2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12718007_10156672395185526_3944694245101336925_n.jpg?oh=426b02ec65b1366a3e2bc438562b9073&oe=59168BAF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156672395185526&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-04T18:55:11+0000	1459796111	2016-04-04 20:55:11	9	26	9	2	37	26	12	14	38	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was visiting Southport for a few days with my son. We went to the Hesketh Tesco Express as he was experiencing tummy pain and was very upset.  Only place I could find that was open late.  I rushed in to get some Calpol and he was so upset and couldn t walk far as his tummy was very painful.  The lady that worked in there  (early 20 s brown hair) sorry I didn t catch her name   came and spoke to him to see how he was and got him a chair to sit on whilst I paid etc. She was so kind to him and really cared.  She even told me about local hospitals etc as I didn t know where they were.  Thankfully he recovered and was just too many sweets.  I will never forget what she did.  She didn t have to do anything but she did anyway.  Please let her know that I am so grateful to her.  Also thank you for being open late on a Sunday Tesco  you really helped a worried mum out.					2016-04-04T18:14:29+0000	1459793669	2016-04-04 20:14:29	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve heard other flavours exist but they re not stocked in our store (Exeter). We re also fans of Swedish Glace   but again we have only one flavour (vanilla).  We re grateful to have any non-dairy icecreams but it would be awesome to have more choice. You have a huge range of dairy icecreams available. Are you planning on making a wider range of non-dairy products available in your Exeter store?  Thank you for already having one of the best free from ranges.

We have had issues with the majority of counter products received since using home delivery. We have also seen issues with replacements. Whoever is selecting these items really needs to be thinking  is this acceptable   would I be happy if this is what I received . They are letting you down. It s been raised with the groceries team. I am sure I will receive a call and a refund. What I really want though is the feeling that someone is doing my shopping with a good level of care and attention. Surely that s not hard...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12924440_10153664810535889_5276609955432133055_n.jpg?oh=ccb37b12651934f43a90135a11041a72&oe=5911FC5A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/12924440_10153664810535889_5276609955432133055_n.jpg?oh=5ebece582bcfe00afe0beb8c8332c4a3&oe=58D8CF57	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153664810535889&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-04T17:33:53+0000	1459791233	2016-04-04 19:33:53	4	10	5	0	15	10	4	6	3	0	4	0	1	0	0	0	0

I ordered a TV at an instore kiosk on 25th March  delivery was scheduled for 30th March. Took a day off to make sure I d be in  only to be told on the morning of the delivery it wasn t being delivered because Tesco and/or your suppliers hadn t delivered it to the courier (allegedly because of the bank holiday).  Rebooked for tomorrow  5th April... and today I thought   I ll contact the courier and Tesco now  just to check  before I take yet another day s holiday .    Guess what? It s still not been delivered to the courier.  And no one can tell me when  or if  that will happen.  Now apparently waiting on your business support team to investigate  and I ve been told I ll get a response possibly tomorrow.  I ve complained already but all I ve had is some mealy mouthed  sorry   with absolutely no offer of any form of compensation for the inconvenience caused. Had I known this was going to be such a massive disaster  I d have ordered from Amazon and would now be happily sitting watching my new TV!  Needless to say  I won t be using Tesco Direct for any future orders.  If you re going to play with the  big boys  like Amazon  at least try and get it right  Tesco.  Very disappointing.					2016-04-04T16:13:12+0000	1459786392	2016-04-04 18:13:12	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The hot deli empty (I wanted a cooked chicken). Lots of empty shelves. No liver or large trays of budget mince (for my dogs).  Only one loaf of fresh (farmhouse)bread on the shelf. So I left and went to Morrisons and spent £27 there. This is almost a daily event in this shop. They had another 8 hours of trading to do. Just look at  the lost sales! I ve complained about this before. But it s getting worse.					2016-04-04T15:07:41+0000	1459782461	2016-04-04 17:07:41	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Look at this picture.  Two boxes of Dolce Gusto Coffee Pods  one Cappuccino  the other Skinny Cappuccino. These are priced the same; but imagine if they were different prices and you wanted to compare the price per pod.  You list one for comparison by pod at 49.9p but list the other one by weight at £24.70 per kg.  Why would you do this? You do it to so many products that you make any price comparison impossible; washing powder  conditioner  coffee  drinks etc.  It s deliberately confusing.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12439287_10154696197018098_5757387965747814805_n.jpg?oh=ce4e7a70b72322668ecca854d4d0dc3e&oe=590B7C7C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12439287_10154696197018098_5757387965747814805_n.jpg?oh=8a68d44035c651a3e37f400c7692d59c&oe=59122B08	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154696197018098&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-04T15:02:29+0000	1459782149	2016-04-04 17:02:29	4	6	4	0	10	5	2	3	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

If I had the time I would take this back to the shop however with 4 children   1 baby and 2 children with asd I just don t have time  hence online shopping.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12936568_1264049923609610_1838730488298057456_n.jpg?oh=9e9249e87bbf35608aed6c0f051525b9&oe=5908E2EF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/12936568_1264049923609610_1838730488298057456_n.jpg?oh=e5f5423f3cfdd74c569cab01bc901b00&oe=591E2193	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1264049923609610&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-04T14:14:48+0000	1459779288	2016-04-04 16:14:48	1	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just wondering if u could tell us all why your fuel prices are up again when wholesale fuel is so reasonable. Maybe you think everyone is busy talking about the referendum??? I can assure you we are not!! Be leaders not followers n give us our fuel at a fair price please! I find it odd that household fuel prices r so very low n are not rising yet yours are? If you could clear this up for the whole of the United Kingdom that would be great!

Had a delivery last night with 4 items of meat missing. I called customer services first thing this morning who said they would get my local store manager to call me and see if they could arrange a delivery of missing items for this evening. It s now 2:45pm and still no call. I then used the online chat facility to see if there was an update  only to be told that they were sure the store manager had it in hand and would call me. I explained that I need to know whether I need to replace the items on my way home so that I can cook dinner but this didn t help. Still waiting and still have no idea whether I need to buy the food again on my way home. At no point has anyone offered me any sort of compensation for the calls and time out of my day to sort this  or a refund for the missing items or for the delivery  given that I am likely to have to make a special trip to buy these items when the whole point of me paying to get them delivered last night was so that I didn t have to go to the store myself and would have the food in time to cook this evening s dinner.					2016-04-04T13:53:49+0000	1459778029	2016-04-04 15:53:49	2	12	2	0	14	12	4	8	7	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I phoned this morning to complain about your Tesco Ultra Dry nappies today and spoke to a lovely girl called  I think  Chantelle.  It is obvious this nappies have changed as they are now thinner and the material is  crispier . The extra stretch on the waist tabs is a good idea but as soon as the nappy gets wet they sag like mad and droop!! The wet area is not evenly spread and hangs between the legs.  However my complaint was about the crystals in the nappy. When my daughter woke from her sleep this morning I changed the nappy she had been in all night and was disgusted to find her bottom was covered in the gel crystals from the nappy!!   I spoke to Chantelle  who was very helpful  and she advised me to take the used nappy  packaging and any unused nappies back to the shop to complete a complaint form. However when I said they were part of my home delivery she had to put me through to the home delivery team.  However Maurice who I then spoke to just wanted to refund me the price of the nappies and couldn t get off the phone quick enough!! I asked him if it would be looked into and he said a message would be sent to the Beverley store where they came from. No bar code or reference number was taken! How can the manufacturer follow up a complaint without these details?  Reading through the comments on this page I see that this is not a one off faulty pack but that the nappies in general are now being made to a lower standard than before! I have always bought your nappies over the Pampers that I have used for my older children as they were genuinely better nappies but I will not be buying them anymore!  I look forward to hearing your comments					2016-04-04T13:12:41+0000	1459775561	2016-04-04 15:12:41	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m wondering who  either at Tesco or Cesar thought it s a good idea to do this ? luckily I was at home  but had I not been  my dog would have certainly eaten them both. Dogs are often on special diets because of health conditions and life threatening allergies  and owners restrict what their dogs consume.  A small dog would almost certainly damage it s mouth chewing through the pouch itself  and if swallowed there could be potentially fatal consequences. Please Tesco  don t do this !					2016-04-04T11:58:06+0000	1459771086	2016-04-04 13:58:06	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Some might say that replacing them is affordable with the profits Tesco make. Complaints will be inevitable if there aren t sufficient trolleys available when required for a big shop. Also when a long queue is forming at the counter for 4 cashiers and one cashier is operating the counter one or more should be in operation too. This speeds up the amount of time customers have to wait to be served avoiding frustration.					2016-04-04T11:56:03+0000	1459770963	2016-04-04 13:56:03	0	7	0	0	7	7	4	3	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There is loads of fat in it  certainly more than 5% and we have tried it 3 times now so not just a dodgy batch. Sainsbury s mince has hardly any fat in it though labelled same as tesco. Shame that tesco quality seems to be slipping on lots of things whilst tesco prices are rising.

I have always purchased your nappies currently we ve been using a 5. We bought some as usual on Saturday and to our surprise they feel different  and the fittings are different in comparison to before. Funnily enough I am also a tester on tesco home panels and actually took part in your nappy trial and these nappies that you have changed to were poor  baggy fitting and just cheap in general which I told you as part of the survey. Is this why the price has gone down and they re now 3 for £10 as the nappy quality is poor compared to before? These nappies were the only ones we found to stop leakage and a nice comfy fit for our boy looks like we re going to have to find another nappy brand that does the job 😐					2016-04-04T11:00:19+0000	1459767619	2016-04-04 13:00:19	2	17	2	0	19	16	3	13	8	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

In that 6 weeks  no amount of clicking the trolley pieces  back  into place  will make the trolley stay in 1 piece  it just keeps coming apart  meaning if my daughter tries to push it the whole thing falls apart.

I normally buy Mamia nappies from Aldi but thought I d try yours.  The fit is great but they are bringing my baby out in a rash on her lower back. I switched her back to the Aldi ones and the rash went away. I put her back in the Tesco ones and it s back. I m quite surprised this has happened as a baby s skin is delicate and as they wearing nappies all day they should be irritant free.					2016-04-04T08:09:33+0000	1459757373	2016-04-04 10:09:33	2	8	2	0	10	8	4	4	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been buying nappies for a year now and never had a problem. One of the best nappies I ve used. Until recently. My last shop I brought 3 packs of size 5 1/2 for £10. Once I started using theses nappies I noticed that they had changed slightly. Obviously trying to make improvements I thought. They looked fine  if not better. They went on well and fitted the same. But when it comes to the use of them they are rubbish!!  My son could usually wear one of the nappies over night and be fine. During the day probably 3-4 hours. But these new ones don t even last 2 hours! They bulge and fill so much. The worst of it though the gel beads from the inside have leaked at every nappy he has worn!!  I checked the other two packs that I got and used some from each but the same thing happened. It got to the case where I ve actually gone else where and used other nappies.					2016-04-04T06:57:52+0000	1459753072	2016-04-04 08:57:52	5	3	5	0	8	3	3	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Do you still stock the fair  med  dark shades in the black pot with the clear lid branded Barbara Daly (not BD Trade Secrets)? If not can you kindly let me know where I can buy it; or where I can get the same product under another name  or who made it for you (as it was excellent & by far the best concealer I have ever used). I need to stock up and only want this product!					2016-04-03T22:29:56+0000	1459722596	2016-04-04 00:29:56	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It clearly quotes on the packaging  expertly selected for freshness & quality  as you can clearly see this is dated 7 April! When I was preparing dinner for the family I was not expecting the sheer disgusting standard of quality and freshness. I am not impressed by the quality that has been shown by the company letting this be on the shelves for customers to buy.

I paid for a slot for today between 10am and 2pm. Received a text saying delivery would be between 11am and 12 noon. 25 past 2 I rang tesco to see where my order was to be told driver had attempted to deliver. Which I know he hadn t. Was told order would be redelivered and I would receive a call telling me approx time. After still hearing nothing I rang again to be told it would be after 6. Rang again at 7.30 to be told it would be here by 9pm. It s now 9.15 and I still have no shopping. Despite several calls to tesco  customer service  I still have no idea where my shopping is or when it will be here and am still awaiting a call telling me when it will be here. And I ve had no apology at any point through any of my phone calls. Think I ll be looking at alternative supermarkets from now on.					2016-04-03T20:17:16+0000	1459714636	2016-04-03 22:17:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I searched on Google and seen that someone else had contacted you so I decided to do the same.   I recently purchased a bottle of Smirnoff vodka in Ballina as I passing through on my way south. I was surprised to find  that the Vodka today is frozen solid  this has happened with a bottle I brought from Aldi Sligo and just thought perhaps Aldi had received a dodgy batch as they were selling it at a marked down price. I am now concerned that perhaps Tesco may also be receiving dodgy alcohol as I have never had Vodka freeze.   I will have to look to see if I still have the receipt for the proof of purchase but needless to say I am not very happy at all and especially when I chose to pay extra for the Smirnoff brand and not buy a other brand or a cheaper Vodka.   I will also be contacting Smirnoff as it seems to be a issue with there product too.					2016-04-03T18:23:15+0000	1459707795	2016-04-03 20:23:15	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I walked into your store at balby Doncaster and my 2 year old tripped up due to the mat that you wipe you feet on being lower than the floor in places . she banged her head and was screaming for a good ten minutes not one member of staff who saw what happened asked me if she was OK and nobody offered any first aid assistance my husband went and told customer services to be told there was nothing they could do about it the manager then gave her a teddy and rung it through to accident support And she was still offered no first aid assistance which according to the person on the phone who my husband spoke to is your policy I then asked for another bear for her twin sister and how much would it be a member of staff gave us the bear and didn t tell me a price or scan it in so I could pay for it I then left the store and was chased out by a member of staff to be told I had to pay for the bear when I had already asked how much it was and was ignored because they could waste one bear not 2 quite frankly I think it s disgusting and the worst bit was no first aider I won t be shopping at tesco again					2016-04-03T18:11:58+0000	1459707118	2016-04-03 20:11:58	1	7	1	0	8	7	3	4	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have been using your tesco loves baby ultra dry for our daughter ever since a colleague put me onto them. We tried them and we thought brilliant they do the job nicely very rarely had any leakage unless someone had put the nappy on wrong that is. At least until you changed the design recently and it would seem with out warning  I would say since the design change we are having at least one leakage a day. I am not angry Tesco just disappointed I fear we may have to change product.   Thanks  Matt.					2016-04-03T18:08:01+0000	1459706881	2016-04-03 20:08:01	1	3	1	0	4	3	3	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

What is the point of complaining to Tesco Head office when they don t believe what you say? We were insulted  humiliated and ill treated by one of their staff recently  who was totally unprofessional  rude and arrogant. Instead  she accuses me of whistling at her to get her attention. For those of you who know me  I would never do something like that. I have complained to them but with no results and no apologies. Has anyone else had problems with Tesco?					2016-04-03T17:20:13+0000	1459704013	2016-04-03 19:20:13	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Allow little but no view for other road users to see past and pass safely. Considering there was plenty of safe parking space on the opposite side of the road. When I asked your driver why he had parked like that he said it would be dangerous to cross a road. Well it isn t we all learn the green cross code when we are infants look both ways twice and let me add it was. 30mph zone not a 50 mph zone so he could have safely crossed.  This is an unacceptable answer from your driver and he was very arrogant in his way. I feel his customer services need to stretch to the rest of the public and he certainly needs to learn about Road safety and how other road users need to be able to see.

Over the millennia that humans have inhabited this planet they have manufactured and used tools which help to make various task easier to achieve; be it a tool or weapon to catch prey for food  a specific brush for an artist to produce a beautiful masterpiece or an online social media outlet to allow quick and easy interaction with a company s customers.   as humanity has evolved and progressed through the ages so have the tools we as a species use to make our lives easier  and that is what brings me to my message of great importance:  PLEASE can you change the fork you include with your pasta dishes (the ones which are included in your meal deals) to something a bit more sturdy? the poorly made utensil which is included with the food is flimsy and frankly difficult to try and eat with. the terrible hinged joint in the middle used to make the handle of the fork longer is incredibly weak and food has been spilt because of it. at times i have even considered using a pair of matchsticks and some tape to form a splint to hold the joint together because of the problems i have had with the folding fork included with the meal. this is 2016. disposable forks should not be as terrible as the ones you include in your pasta meals.  a shorter  sturdier handled fork would be much more convenient to use  even for someone with large hands such as myself. you could take a leaf out of the co-operative s book and use the humble Spork. it is a delightful tool created for easy  on-the-go consumption of meals which need a utensil which has both the prongs to hold food safely and the capacity to keep a decent amount of the meal in place as it travels from bowl/plate to mouth.   top much of your delicious pasta has been spilt down the front of people s clothes because the utensil you have provided has been inefficient at keeping food in place between plate and mouth.  i implore you  PLEASE make a change. let no more pasta be spilt because of this minor  yet horrible problem.  sincerely  Joshua Hammond.					2016-04-03T15:00:30+0000	1459695630	2016-04-03 17:00:30	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This very special Cornetto didn t have any milk in it and consisted of delicious vanilla and strawberry ice cream  wrapped in a crunchy  chocolate lined cone with a strawberry sauce through the middle.  Everybody rejoiced at this wondrous creation.  Until one fateful day.  Imagine the horror of the unsuspecting customer  after carefully unwrapping the delicious treat to find that the previously crunchy cone was soft  lifeless...flaccid. The chocolate was gone! No more was the cone a testament to confectionary engineering. No more was there a solid  tantalising chocolate end to the cone!  The customer fell to his knees and cried sugarless tears of bottomless grief. The glory days were over and the prospect of a world without a chocolate coating brought an incurable ache to his heart.

He has put milk in with the meal deal and answered questions relating to meat and origins. .... could we ask all Tesco stores to promote milk in with the meal deal .

So I jump in the car and off I pop to my local Tesco. I arrive at the sweets aisle  and after a good look up and down  I couldn t seem to find anything remotely related to easter (mini eggs/ creme eggs in particular I was hunting for). So I thought to myself surely they will be here somewhere so I searched round the entire store  but to my horrer there was absolutely nothing remotely related to Easter left! I appreciate Easter was a tad early this year but come on!?! It s only the the 3rd of April! 😢					2016-04-03T13:02:45+0000	1459688565	2016-04-03 15:02:45	1	7	2	1	10	7	5	2	2	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

After being a customer for twelve years and a delivery saver customer I am appalled at your service. I bought a Sony TV a couple of months ago with a so called  Game Mode  on for my sons game console...obviously thinking that it would therefore have a great picture quality etc in that mode. I have bought calibration discs etc tuned this that and the other and it is appalling colours and picture. I feel I was mis sold this product and as its took me two months to find out that is is inadequate for a games console you will not refund as I was told by phone. I will not be purchasing any more items from you ever again tesco direct anything....I am fuming. This item IS NOT as described!					2016-04-03T07:46:53+0000	1459669613	2016-04-03 09:46:53	0	30	0	0	30	29	3	26	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is the evo trike catalogue number 211-4302. We seem to have misplaced the charger during our house move and it is a much loved toy. Can I purchase the charger separately at all? I don t seem to be getting anywhere with the customer services. Many thanks for your help. Katy Stern					2016-04-03T07:17:07+0000	1459667827	2016-04-03 09:17:07	1	7	1	0	8	7	6	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Do you not stock any other free range chicken (And yes  I know you have  higher welfare  - but that is only one step up from caged)? Please could you also pass on my recommendation that all your chicken (bar maybe your saver range) are free range?

I went shopping around 5.30 and when I had finished I went to get in my car and realised I had lost my keys 😳 i asked customer services and no keys had been handed in. The security guards helped me look round the store as did the night staff. No keys to be found anywhere 😞 I had 2 young children and a trolley full of shopping. The staff went beyond their duty to help me  I was there for 4 hours in all waiting for my insurance company to recover my car and get me home.. So the recovery turns up and im told they can t take me and kids because I have no car seats! Tesco ordered me a cab and paid for it and gave me a bunch of flowers even giving me and children drinks and some snacks. I really want to say from the bottom of my heart thank you to Tesco staff for going out of their way to make sure me and my kids got home safe and for all their help tonight.  They were just amazing and made the whole bad experience less stressful. Keep up the good work Tesco thank you so much.					2016-04-02T22:26:09+0000	1459635969	2016-04-03 00:26:09	10	1	11	0	12	1	1	0	1	0	10	0	0	0	1	0	0

Considering that the World Health Organisation has classified GLYPHOSATE as a probable carcinogen  with the EU currently reviewing Monsanto s licence in Europe & Brighton & Hove Council s recent decision to BAN the use of GLYPHOSATE & WAITROSE s decision to WITHDRAW weedkillers containing GLYPHOSATE from their stores; Please advise WHY TESCO are still stocking weedkillers containing this product.  Also Cullompton Town Council does not use GLYPHOSATE  when dealing with weeds.

However  much to my disappointment  all bar one type of jeans in this particular store are either skinny  jeggings or super skinny - I m afraid that isn t realistic for someone like myself with a few extra pounds. The only pair that would have fitted were very casual jeans  with the  fashionable  small rips. For someone in their 30s who wants a sensible  comfortable pair of jeans there s nothing. I thought that this should be brought to your attention  as while it is easy to order clothes online it s much better to be able to try them on in store to see what suits. A wider range of jeans/casual trousers would be greatly appreciated!					2016-04-02T20:18:32+0000	1459628312	2016-04-02 22:18:32	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

With twins it can be quite challenging trying to get your shopping done so whilst me and my partner Robert were putting our shopping through she kept our 7 month old amused and stopped her crying! May I also add she has done this for us a few times when both babies have been screaming the shop down. Keep up the amazing work Vicky! She defiantly needs reward.

I have been online shopping for the last 8 years and ive got to say that Tescos is slowly going down the pan. The last 3 weeks I have had too many fresh items with short dates on ( I mean to be consumed the day after ive bought them!!)  Many things on the website not being sold by Tesco any more (not specialist items either  everyday items )  Then you have changed suppliers for a lot of your veg and fresh meats and ive got to say they are substandard to what you stocked before. Now i appreciate you have to look for cheaper alternatives and money making is your game but the customer helps you by buying your stuff !!   Plus your prices are rising every week too. Im sorry but as a reverent Tesco customer it grieves me to have to even think about going elsewhere but im sorry I will be going elsewhere from next week. I have the choice of ASDA  SAinsbury for delivery  Morrisons I can get taxis and still save with the taxi fare include  Iceland  Aldi and Lidl. Being disabled and having mobility issues the home delivery from Tescos was why I chose you in the first place 8 years ago  but Im sorry the way your not putting your customers needs first anymore is why Im going else where. You must realise people shop for the week at least when they order online not daily so the short dates on fresh items should reflect the needs of online grocery shoppers surely as intelligent people you should see that. Put the short dates on shelves in stores  make online shoppers have at least 5 days on their stuff the amount of stuff going in my bin as well is shameful. Sorry Tesco you have let me down again.					2016-04-02T19:25:32+0000	1459625132	2016-04-02 21:25:32	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

About my salad  that had unauthorised Ham in it.  I was advised to take it back to my local store. I did this they kept me waiting for over half an hour then asked me to leave it with them. Then my local store kept it for 6days  lost the piece of ham and then told me they couldn t deal with it. Phoned me to get me to collect the salad to take it back to a larger store. I went to collect it and they couldn t find it  I was kept waiting for another 30mins. They eventually gave me 2 salad bowls with no Ham piece. So now I have 2 salad bowls  no wrong piece of Ham and am really disappointed.  Please help.					2016-04-02T19:14:03+0000	1459624443	2016-04-02 21:14:03	0	13	0	0	13	13	3	10	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Although there were plenty of Mails left  there were none of the packs available.  Checkout staff said there are never enough of the offer goods to match the number of papers.  I think there ought to some way that the many people missing out on the offer in store can be sent the goods.  I realise that in VERY small print on what is a large promotional banner on the front page of the paper it does say  while stocks last  but this should not be used to excuse a serious shortage of the offer goods.					2016-04-02T16:28:55+0000	1459614535	2016-04-02 18:28:55	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went purposely to one of your extra stores to buy some wine while you had 25% of 6 bottles or more.  I checked the self flyer and it had not terms and conditions only to find out when I got to the till that I would not get 25% of the 12 bottles I wanted to buy.   The reason I was given was that it was not applicable to bottles under £4 with a low % of alcohol.   As a consequence I did not purchase the wine I asked for the 25% to be taken off as advertised but the gentleman on customer services was very rude.

Just returned from tesco in Drogheda today.  I purchased my groceries and my 25year old son was next with some alcohol.  He was asked for ID but had none.  I am all for policies if there executed properly and in line with other policies.  The cashier tried to explain the policy and I argued with her. The supervisor was called and her explanation wasn t much more helpful.  They couldn t sell the alcohl to me because they said i was buying it for him.  This is ridiculous.    1.  No signage at the alcohol counter about company policy.  2. Would I have have been so stupid as to let this happen had i known the policies. NO.  I just would ve told my son I would get the alcohol for him and sent him outside to wait.  He is 25 after all  3. You can purchase alcohol online and have it delivered to the home of a person who has  teenagers living with them. Does this mean you shouldn t sell alcohol on line? 4. Are we communists now  being dictated to and  we re not allowed to think for ourselves.    Anyway my son did get his alcohol. I had to leave the original alcohol at the cashiers and I simply went and picked up the same items again and went to an other cashier.  Tesco   I have read umteen complaints about this issue.  Will you please do something about it.  Good customer service goes a long way.					2016-04-02T14:46:29+0000	1459608389	2016-04-02 16:46:29	1	45	1	1	47	43	21	22	140	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Is this a crass move to get us hooked on your products cause if it is it ain t going to work  in fact I think I ll avoid your products even more from now on for treating people like me as a gullible idiot. I only wanted a bag of luxury  Savoury  potato chips is that to much to ask? Note the word I used is  Savoury  like what the product name suggests! If I wanted a sweet I d buy candy or chocolate  potato chips isn t my first port of call for a sweet but by the amount of sugar you shove in what should be a savoury sack I can only assume you have very different taste ideas  but to me and my wife all we could taste was the sickly sweet sugar you d clumsily laced everything in. If this is a product of your taste testing panel (Tesco Finest Hand Cooked Crisps) I think you should sack the bloody lot of them cause their expectations isn t what people want from what should be a simple savoury snack!					2016-04-02T13:51:39+0000	1459605099	2016-04-02 15:51:39	2	6	2	0	8	6	4	2	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We had gone to the shop to get him a toy as he had been very ill and struggling to take his medicine at the hospital  he had chosen a thunderbirds toy as a prize that he had asked for everything we go into your store. When we went in we found it  went to the till to buy it and they refused to sell it to us as  it wasn t registered!  That toy has been on your shelves for weeks  possibly months as he has asked us for it every time we ve been in there. He is refusing to go back to the hospital to take his medicine  and thinks that we just wouldn t buy it for him....

Had an opticians appointment booked on Monday first thing  waited 40 mins and the optician did not turn up for work. Normal working hours Monday to Friday so had to book myself in for today. Suffering with constant headaches as believe I need a new prescription and feel my glasses are not strong enough now. Just had a call and optician has not turned up AGAIN today. Now I have to have another week of constant headaches plus at least another week waiting for my new glasses. This is not acceptable and this needs looking into further and I would like a response as to what is being done.					2016-04-02T11:12:16+0000	1459595536	2016-04-02 13:12:16	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Passing through Weedon on a long car journey  my 2 year old was travel sick so we stopped in the car park to clean up. A member of staff came out  asked if we wanted to use the staff bathroom  helped me to rinse clothes out and very kindly wrapped up my daughter in a Tesco fleece to keep her warm. Unfortunately  I didn t get this girls name but I wanted to make you aware that this lady has been exceptionally kind  thoughtful and generous and please thank her from the bottom of my heart.

I brought 3 bags of size 4+ nappies from you last week like I do every month for my 2 daughter.  But this new bag is rubbish!! My daughters (10month  23 months) has been leaking out their nappies  even after me changing their bums 30mins before! They are not soaking up her wee as good as they used to  Also I noticed that when cleaning cleaning her bum  I see the crystals from the nappy which has never happened before.   I noticed with this bag I opened the waist band bit had changed but makes me wonder if anything else has changed??   I shop with you every week for my weekly shop and buy my daughter nappies from your every 3 weeks!! I am really considering going back to aldis nappies but this really doesn t help me as I don t shop in aldis which is why I swapped to tescos!

Please see attached picture.  What is that tesco?! Please tell me! Because unless my eyes need checking I see 2  yes 2!! Cookie crumble bars and there isn t a caramel bar in sight?! Care to answer me why?  I m just sitting down in my lounge watching My Little Pony with my daughter when she toddles over with what is my only easter egg this year. How could I refuse her some chocolate when she throws it in my face yelling  ta mama! Ta ta ta!!  Adorable right? She s 16 months old.  So I though  okay I ll open it and spare her a tiny piece of a cube. Now my favourite is the caramel bar. Cookie crumble just doesn t cut it for me. So to receive 2 of the same bar is just not good enough.   So now I m left without my favourite bar of chocolate and my daughter is running around the lounge clutching a cookie crumble bar in each hand laughing her head off. I think I ve missed the funny part here. :(   I look forward to what you have to say.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12928320_10153986219405132_3947885204259135906_n.jpg?oh=9159d14a15b9aad9cc3db9f5a9e1cf6c&oe=59243F0A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12928320_10153986219405132_3947885204259135906_n.jpg?oh=dac29c0f7c1bd56e0869011106309fa1&oe=59205107	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153986219405132&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-02T07:09:00+0000	1459580940	2016-04-02 09:09:00	7	18	7	0	25	18	5	13	6	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I placed an online grocery order  scheduled for home delivery between 10pm-11pm this evening. It is now 11:30pm and my delivery has not arrived. I have heard nothing from the delivery driver  and all of your customer contact telephone lines closed at 11pm. There is nobody within your company with whom I can speak to tonight to determine whether my order is  merely  late or whether it will even be delivered at all. I have checked on my online account and am unable to track the progress of my order- because my delivery timeslot has passed  it is showing as a previous order. To add insult to injury  several of my items are also showing as unavailable. So not only are you unable to deliver my groceries in the timeslot which I paid for  you are also unable to deliver everything that I ordered. Is this an April Fool s joke? Because it really isn t funny.  Should your delivery driver decide to make an appearance tonight  I will not be accepting anything. And I can assure you that not only will I be calling your customer services line first thing tomorrow morning to escalate this further  but I will never be using your online service again. This is completely unacceptable.  Melissa					2016-04-01T22:36:24+0000	1459550184	2016-04-02 00:36:24	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Probably not! So why do you feel its acceptable to let our s? Our beds for them that we ordered turned up last week and when we went to put them up we noticed some of the lats were missing. My wife emailed on tuesday when you were back after the bank holiday and was promised they would be sent out that day on 24 hour delivery! Wednesday came and they still didnt turn up so my wife emailed again and was promised they would be here by today (friday) she waited in all day and even told someone where to put them if she had to nip out and guess what?? Still NO delivery so yet again they will have to sleep on the floor and you have ignored our emails today! Totally unacceptable  seen as though you wont answer in private maybe you will on here where everyone can see it!! And if you delete it i will put it back on!					2016-04-01T19:51:52+0000	1459540312	2016-04-01 21:51:52	1	7	2	0	9	7	1	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Unfortunately these pies are limited edition?  Please say this isn t true!  Vegetarian food tends to be bland  spicy  overly peppery  dry or filled with icky goats cheese. FINALLY veggie food that is full of flavour and tasty!   Tesco does tend to cater well for vegetarians in the frozen aisle  but there is not enough choice elsewhere  so please don t bin this pie off  because although I absolutely love them  there are only so many Tesco cauliflower grills one person can eat.					2016-04-01T19:46:18+0000	1459539978	2016-04-01 21:46:18	2	3	2	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

He has since been diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes with a reading of 84.6 (the consultant has never seen it that high before) while thankfully he is hopefully on the mend he is still in hospital for the foreseeable future. I think either the staff need more training or they are using faulty equipment.... either way if he had taken there advice it could have been such a different outcome xx PLEASE INVESTIGATE xx					2016-04-01T16:23:17+0000	1459527797	2016-04-01 18:23:17	2	4	2	0	6	4	1	3	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was quite happy when I arrived at the store but had steam coming out of my ears by the time I left.  If you are going to have fresh meat  fish and deli counters then surely it makes sense to actually have staff on them to serve.  I stood at the fresh meat counter for several minutes being ingnored by two men on the deli counter who were standing doing nothing.  The girl on the fish counter was having a conversation with a customer and she ignored me as well.  I don t mind waiting my turn but when I am the only one there waiting to be served it would be nice to be acknowledged at least.  This is not the first time this has happened. The Montrose store is a busy one and I would have thought that on a Friday afternoon it would make sense for all counters to be manned.  You lost sales of over £20.00 today from me.  Not a lot I know but multiply it by 52 and it mounts up.					2016-04-01T14:23:48+0000	1459520628	2016-04-01 16:23:48	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been craving this product since I was 6 weeks pregnant and have eagerly been making trips to my local store and making my way to the deli aisle where I am hoping to find the little carton of green goodness waiting on me only to be immensely disappointed each time 😢😢😢 I m sure you can appreciate that pregnancy is a difficult enough time for any woman never mind being unable to satisfy mega cravings. I hope perhaps you can shed some light as to when I can expect to be able to satisfy said cravings. This is not only in the interest of keeping baba in the making happy but in the interest of public safety and others by keeping a pregnant hormonal woman happy. 😀😀😀 I look forward to your response and eagerly await my tiny little beans of joy. Kind Regards   Pregnant Hormonal Lady.					2016-04-01T13:42:46+0000	1459518166	2016-04-01 15:42:46	31	12	32	1	45	12	9	3	26	0	31	0	0	1	0	0	0

This is totally unacceptable as I would think products relating to food are taken in high health code standards. I am confident that this occurrence is not in compliance with health code standards Tesco. Rest assured  if I do not receive a timely response  I will not hesitate to tell others of my misfortune. And  I shall also inform the proper city and health officials so that they may take appropriate actions.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12920258_10156662022905304_7676837167937238029_n.jpg?oh=58c95ea708a0187b4fec66032a524c56&oe=5919EA9C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12920258_10156662022905304_7676837167937238029_n.jpg?oh=fa904f08b06126b849b16a0fa3cd13fe&oe=58DD4591	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156662022905304&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-04-01T13:11:25+0000	1459516285	2016-04-01 15:11:25	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As this is one of the main celebrations in the Christian callender  I find this move offensive. Christian religions are again being pushed aside in a country which is Christian based.

I hope you take this on-board as I d like the ability to nip out on my lunch break and go to tesco to grab a sandwich and a copy of whatever was recently released  just a example  3 AAA games I tried to buy from Tesco; The Division which has 39 members alone from Uckfield (via multiplayer  that s 39 sales lost) I also tried to buy Assassins Creed Syndicate and Tony Hawkes Pro Skater 5 but none where available. Also your game prices need to be more in line with current prices  selling a 2 year old game that you can get new for £19 and you re still selling it for £44  I don t know who is responsible for keeping up to date with all this and deciding what to do but gaming is a multi BILLION $£€ business and your lack of interest hurt both consumer and profit. I hope this changes soon as there are 6 big and 4 small games I hope to buy this year and should you stock them  it would make my life easier  and I am not alone.					2016-04-01T07:26:49+0000	1459495609	2016-04-01 09:26:49	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
