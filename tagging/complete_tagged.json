    "post_message": "Oh where to begin. I ll post here because apparently my emailed complaint might take 3 days to respond to.  Order 246776485 - your systems are currently showing it as delivered this evening  but it wasn t.  Imagine you have a £50 incentive reward card  in the format of a Mastercard. Imagine you also have a delivery saver refund of £15.  Now imagine  that having put the code through  at checkout it tells you the exact amount to pay is £50.  Then  the next day  the store tries to put through a payment of over £70  because that s how the system works . Really? You check cards for a higher payment than that to be charged?   Yes we check the card before any vouchers or delivery saver comes off  said the clueless woman on the phone.  Erm  overstepping the mark part 1 there. I authorised £50 at checkout  not £71.   That s what would happen if you shopped in store  said the clueless woman on the phone.  now let s see... you would scan my shopping  then scan any vouchers... nope you don t know if I am paying by card or cash at this point but would tell me the amount. So no  it isn t what would happen in store.  I then get home from work after telling you to stick the order up your backside to be told by the teenage children that you also called my home number & asked one of them to make an alternative payment.  I m sure he d pay you it back  was what was said.  Overstepping the mark part 2 there Tesco  discussing my account with other people.  I look forward to my voucher being given back to me too  that was for monies already paid to you.",

I m not sure which store this lady came from  but what a <U+2B50><U+FE0F> today as I left to pick up my daughter up from nursery in Desborough  Northamptonshire. I walked past my elderly neighbour and a delivery driver from Tescos was talking to him. I realised something had happened so stopped to ask if all was ok. My poor neighbour had fallen off of his scooter and it had landed on top of him (thankfully just bruised and nothing broken) the lady driver had stopped and helped him up  picked his scooter up and spent a good few minutes talking to him and even came back to check on him after she had made her deliveries! What a wonderful lady! Thank you for taking time out of your day to show compassion for someone that really needed help.

    "post_message": "Just visited your store in Wallace Street  Stirling  and I ve got to say  I am appalled at the level of customer service I just received from the member of staff on till 17.   Said member of staff made no attempt to chat  being from a background in customer service  this is a vital aspect of any customer facing role  and really makes a difference to the experience from the consumers view.   Said member of staff was too interested in staring at their own hands and picking the skin around their nails to engage in even  I assume  essential  Tesco  chat. I wasn t asked if I had a clubcard  I handed this to the member of staff and it was promptly snatched out my hands  scanned and thrown back to me  I wasn t asked if I needed any bags  on this occasion I did need to purchase a 5p bag  so had to ask for this. Price of my shop was rudely grunted at me  with no eye contact  and hand held out in anticipation for money. I asked to pay by card and again was grunted approval of this.   There was no thank you  no see you later  nothing  there was nothing...   As a company working mainly in customer service  I feel certain members of your direct customer facing team need vast improvement and training on their skills.   I am not asking for a full life story and to find out what the member of staff serving me had for dinner on Monday last week and where they are off on holidays next year  but I do feel it would equate to a much more pleasant shopping experience  if your staff at least tried to engage with their customers. I appreciate everyone has bad days  days they don t want you talk to people  they may be ill  be suffering from personal issues or potentially just had a right rollicking from a senior member of staff  but unfortunately  from my experience  when you are serving customers  especially face to face  you have to push this aside.   I m not going to say I won t shop here again  I know I will  leading a busy life and with the shop mere moments from my front door  I do lean towards the convenience  I can only hope next time I spend money in your store  the next member of staff who serves me will be a vast improvement on the last.",

    "post_message": "Have you stopped selling hatchimals in store because no customers were getting them? We ve been lied to repeatedly about delivery dates by Tesco Kidderminster. At the beginning of November  we were told that the store has non food deliveries Friday night/ Saturday morning and Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. The woman on customer services even checked the expected delivery contents of the delivery expected that night and showed us that they were anticipating a small number of the toys. We got to the store at 00:05 and asked a woman on the shop floor to check the delivery for us (it had clearly been delivered as they were unpacking it in the aisles) and she said that had nothing had been delivered for the toy section at all and that they don t get toy deliveries on Friday nights and that it would be Monday at the earliest. So we found the woman from customer services and told her what had happened. She apologised and said that the manager of the of the toy department had confirmed they were expecting a delivery on that night.  She offered to get us the night manager but by this point it was nearly 01:00 and and we wanted to go home.  Monday morning we go in and asked if any Hatchimals had been delivered overnight in the delivery. We were told that the store didn t have non food deliveries on Sunday night/Monday morning.   We left it a couple of weeks. Last week  we asked customer services if any had been delivered. The woman told us that they had had one delivered in the previous week  but the best day to ask would be Wednesday because that s delivery day. We told her about what had happened earlier in the month so she rang the warehouse and they confirmed that non food deliveries -including toys - were Friday night/Saturday morning and Tuesday night/Wednesday morning.  Last Wednesday  my dad goes in at 04:50  en route to work  and asks if any had been delivered. He got told that they don t have deliveries for toys on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning and to try Friday.  My dad goes in Friday  as suggested  and asks if any Hatchimals had been delivered. The person on customer services says that Friday isn t a delivery day and that he should have come in Wednesday as they had a delivery in the night because that s their toy delivery date and they had DEFINITELY had some delivered.  Now  in the grand scheme of things  not being able to get a toy is hardly the end of the world. Would it be nice to be able to get one? Of course it would  but nobody is going to die and the world is going to carry on spinning. However  the lying is not acceptable. I suspect the staff were probably witholding them and your withdrawal from stores will probably remedy this  but why feel the need to lie in the first place? If they weren t doing anything wrong  then surely there wasn t a need to lie to us and lead us along?  It would be less infuriating if the journey to the store wasn t a 10 mile round trip  or if the mistake had only happened once.",

I cut my finger and obviously now need to arrange for a replacement/top segment. I would have thought the package would have been labelled handle with care due to the black glass material that was used for the top. I think you should contact the delivery company as I handled the stand with care and only moved it two feet from where it was delivered.  Can someone get back to asap in regards to getting a replacement sent out.   This is the second Black Friday I have used Tesco direct and the first was a nightmare.  Regards  Kial",

    "post_message": "Well Tesco  where do I start? To say I am disappointed is an understatement!  I ordered a gift for my friends little boy on 17th Nov  the email stated it would be delivered 19th Nov! I then received a text and email advising me that the product was in store! I went to the store (Falkirk) on the 20th Nov with my 3 month old baby (with temp -2) outside to be advised it was not in the store! The lady checked other stores nearby just in case but said no  not in any store!  I called cust serv on the 21st Nov  the lady advised me this was a courier error! She said she could either refund or re order  was this was for a gift I asked for it to be re ordered  she guaranteed me it would be in the store the following day (22nd Nov)! This wasn t the case!!  I received an email on the 23rd Nov advising me it would be delivered on the 26th Nov!  Today I went to the store to collect and guess what.... no parcel there! The lady kindly checked and told me it was at FennyLock (which I ve never heard off)! So back home I go (again having to waste petroleum  time and taking my baby out the house in cold weather)   I phone customer services (the guy on the phone sounded like he couldn t care less) told me that this was unsuccessfully delivered to the store but didn t know why! I advised this is the 2nd time this has happened (I can t understand as it s a 24 hour store) and asked to speak to complaints department!  I then speak to a lady (turned out the guy hadn t done a warm transfer) who I had to tell my story to again  she advised oh I am not the right person to be dealing with this and put me through to another guy (this time doing a warm handoff)! He advised me that he didn t think he was the right person either  so I explain my story again (for the 3RD time)! He then says he can only apologise and will order the goods again! I advised him this is the first and last time I will use Tesco online and could I complain! He advised me Tesco do not have a complaints department (which I find VERY hard to believe) but he gave me a customer journey email address (yes it will outline my journey but won t resolve my complaint)! I asked the guy when my product would be in store  he couldn t tell me and said it will be on your email  but normally takes 2 days to arrive but can take longer! So after 40 minutes on the phone and speaking to 3 different people my complaint has not been resolved so the only other option is go to social media! So Tesco I am looking for the following: - why on 2 occasions has my parcel been undelivered to a 24 hour store? - why is there no complaints department? - how are you going to restore me as a customer shopping with you again? - what are you doing about my inconvenience? - what are you doing to ensure my perception arrives in the store?   I look forward to hearing from you soon  failure to do so I will be taking this further!  Thanks",

    "post_message": "Good evening Tesco s I would like to just do a shout out to your manager Phil at Tech Support who after 4 weeks finally got us a resolution regarding a broken Samsung tablet .  I will not bore you with all the details but it has been a very long 4 weeks with lots of phone calls to and throw. Real shame that throughout this process one of your Tech staff were very rude on 2 separate occasions and spoke to me like something on the bottom of his shoe !  It s a shame it took over 4 weeks to get a replacement ( not able to collect until Thursday)  but certainly wouldn t want any other customer enduring this process again with Samsung and the number of let downs we went through. Definitely needs improving on that side of things with Samsung.  Thank you Phil again though and thanks for all your help .",

However disaster soon arose when we realised to our horror half our shopping was missing! Especially the toilet rolls cos come on have you had two toddlers and no toilet roll??? We briefly considered calling in MI5 batman iron man or even Darth Vader.... But instead we sufficed with an amaze balls duty manager called James Williams who was our superhero! He went above and beyond to find what happened to our shopping.... After determining that it had not been abducted by aliens  held hostage or held under protest it was in fact determined the packer  forgot  half the printed list (he or she was obviously pre engaged with end of the world matters and the survival dynamic as a whole).. Any way James in his super cape had a van to us within the hour with said missing items and even magicked up a box of choccies for the problems we faced.

Called customer services and was told to visit the store as it s up to their discretion. I visited the store which is not near me at all! And was advised all they could do was let me spend the £52 voucher on toys on their store. I didn t want any toys I wanted the paw patroller I had paid for and expected to collect at some point! They were unwilling to offer me cash or let me spend the voucher on other areas of the store. I visited the small toy isle and there was nothing either of my children would be interested in!  I only want a paw patroller!!! I now have a useless £52 voucher and no paw patroller + so I don t disappoint my son Christmas Day I m going to have to go buy 1 in another shop for £60+!!!

She spoke to my 4 year old daughter who wasnt coping well with seeing the sick! While we went to the baby change  she cleared up and put all my daughters clothes in a bag and even tried to clean her shoes. She found a tshirt for me to wrap her up in and gave me flowers and my older daughter a gift for being brave!  I was in such a tizz that I didn t get her name but I wanted her kindness to be recognised if possible.",

    "post_message": "I have always been an avid Tesco shopper. Not because it is better value than anyother store as I think many of the main supermarkets are very much of a muchness.  But for the convenience  it has always been a shop I know and can pop in and out very quickly. Unfortunately today has been a sad day for me. I visited your Long eaton shop to find disorder. I understand that you have felt the need to add more clothes stores which many people I am sure are happy about. What I am unsure about is that I would have thought your main line was as a food provider. This it would appear has unfortunately taken a slip here.  People are struggling to find anything in your store. I am aware that you have had to reshuffle things about to make way for the new clothes but please please could I make just 3 suggestions. 1) Please change the overhead signs so they are actually correct (I for one struggled to understand why Clingfilm and foil is stored on the pet food isle it took me ages to work that one out??) I know there were small signs on the isles telling people where things now are but those seem to have disappeared. 2) Give out a floor plan to your shoppers so that they know where everything now is. 3) Make sure all your staff know where everything is and are happy to show people. This I would have thought was a given but today it took me 3 people to ask before I found out where the cling fulm was. The 1st person wanted to moan about how they had no idea why they were having to change everything around (apparently their not paid for that  something I really didnt want to know) and the 2nd person didn t have a clue.   I hate to moan but maybe a little more pre thinking and organisation would have been better.  I hate to say it but my next shop may well be Asda  if I have no clue where anything is at Tesco anymore I might as well give Asda a shot as many people have recommended them to me and now I don t feel any need to be loyal as I dont need thus hassle  shopping is stressful enough when I know where everything is.",

    "post_message": "Dear Tesco  your online system lies and has just completely ruined a charity event on Friday. Thanks.   I put in an order for a gazebo to keep two primary school choirs dry if the weather turns during our charity event on Friday.  It said it would be delivered within 2-5 days. Once I had clicked through and paid  it changed its delivery time to 8 days! Thats 3 days after the event so useless to me. I understand that you are dealing with a lot of black friday orders  but please  please ensure your website gives the correct details! Changing a delivery date after payment is  unethical at best and probably illegal.  To make it worse  when I clicked through to cancel  it wouldn t let me click the  give a reason  button and wouldn t let me cancel the order without clicking it. So when I desperately need to be finding a gazebo elsewhere  from a company who will deliver when they say they will  I had to spend time on your automated phone system  then waiting to speak to a manager because your call centre staff said a refund wouldn t clear for 3-5 days!

    "post_message": "Hi  I ve just been to your Tesco Extra store in Pool  Cornwall to return a pack of boys school socks which were originally purchased for when my son started school in September 2015.        I bought the correct size for his measured feet only to find  after trying on a pair at home  that they were absolutely massive.              I didn t  unpack  any more of them and decided to put them to one side for him to grow into and purchased another pack in the smaller size on my next visit.           He has now outgrown/worn out of the smaller ones so I got the larger pack out of the draw. Again they were still really big even though his feet have obviously grown a lot.                                        I cut the rest of the packaging (the plastic bits that hold all of the pairs together) off of the pack this weekend only to discover that there were 2 different sizes in the pack. On closer inspection there were actually 3 different sizes!!! (Even though they all say the same size in them!)                                                                                    Obviously he needs more than a couple of pairs that fit to see him through the week which is why I went to return them today and hopefully end up with 1 pack (7 pairs) of all the same size socks.                  First of all the lady on customer service desk disputed the obvious size differences but said if I wasn t happy then to go and get another pack.                                                                                  On returning with a pack of socks she started shaking her head at me. The reason for this was that there were no socks there that resembled the school socks that I was returning - the only grey school socks were ribbed and only had 5 pairs in the pack (2 pairs less - which I was prepared to accept).                                                                                               So due to not having kept the receipt or the outer cardboard packaging (for over a year and not realising the socks weren t all the same size)  she said they couldn t exchange them and that was the end of it.           I understand that not having the receipt or barcode makes things more difficult but the socks all have  F&F  in them with the size and obviously haven t been worn.                                                                                                                             I would be extremely grateful if someone could help me with this matter as when I purchased the original pack  I did not receive a complete pack of the same size socks as stated.   Regards  Helen x",

It is a very nasty preservative responsible for allergies of an epidemic scale!! I have a bottle at home which is  free-from  but on Sunday I looked at the label in-shop and saw the dreaded word. The only alternatives (there are only two free of MI) are either over £1 or £2 which is a bit rubbish seeing as your own costs under 50p!!  Please  Google  this allergy. It is very nasty and often affects people who have never suffered from sensitive skin. It is essentially a poison and can cause nerve damage and digestive problems as well as the classic skin/ mucous membrane problems....It is basically a cheaper alternative whose use should be restricted to paint and industrial lubricants. However it is now put into cosmetics and even in baby products....",

I ve recently moved and totally forgot to change the adress with everything going on plus my 6month old son has been poorly! The driver said that usually what would happen is that I would have to re order my shopping to get delivered again  but the money wouldn t go back in my account for 3 days! My heart sank as I spent up the last of my money on the shopping and I don t get paid until Wednesday. The delivery driver said that as he could see I ordered baby food and nappies he would phone his boss and see what he could do (this was without me explaining my situation) he then phoned back and asked me for my adress. This lovely man then came and delivered my shopping still with a huge smile on his face even though it was completely out of his was for his next job! I would like to say a huge thank you and for this man to get some recognition as I know for some it might not seem huge but for me it s made a massive difference between being ok and struggling until Wednesday. I have recently just bought a house and I  have a 6 month old so maternity pay is far from great it hasn t been easy  but this man s act of kindness has made a huge difference so thank you to the tescos delivery driver from walkden tescos you ve made my day!

Shopping yesterday with my 10 month old in the trolley  all was well and I thought she might fall asleep on the way round. However  as I picked up the last item on my list she began crying  I picked her up for a cuddle but this did not appease her. She wanted only one thing  and that was to be breastfed. Now  I m not particularly shy or bothered about feeding in public  but with her show down she had created quite an audience. Non the less  I pulled my trolley over to the end of the frozen aisle and began feeding hoping she d be quick and I wouldn t be in anyone s way. After about two minutes I looked up to see a few members of staff approach me  as if reading my mind they offered me to get me a chair to sit down on so I could continue feeding her in comfort. I was so pleased I could have cried! Not only for the chair  but for the acknowledgement and acceptance of normalizing breastfeeding in public! Well done Tesco!

    "post_message": "Tesco   Having purchased a iPad Air 2 yesterday for my son I decided to visit your Tesco extra store in Longton today to buy a case to keep it protected. Once I arrived at the store my 5 year old son spent 10 minutes deciding which one he wanted before we made our way to the self service till to complete our purchase. Having queued for 5minutes it was our turn next  scanned product and it came up on the till unrecognised item. The assistant came across  who then called someone else over to find the code to put it through the till. We were left waiting a further 10minutes for the assistant to return to tell us that they are unable to sell us the £18 iPad case as it won t scan on the till.  If you have children you will understand how upset my son was that he couldn t buy the item he wanted and the fact that we had spent 10 minutes waiting for some to come to the conclusion that we just couldn t by it. The Tesco staff in the store didn t seem interested in making the customer happy or in fact that the were losing a sale. I don t understand why you have products on sale if you won t sell them.  We returned home minus a case  resulting in a iPad that is still unprotected  one very upset child  1hr of our time wasted and 10miles travelled for no reason.  I would be very interested to hear your thoughts on this and if it is standard practice??",

These two everyday items cost me £6.50. If I was to buy these items not gluten free it would have cost me £3.00. So I want to ask you why am I being charged over twice as much for having to eat gluten free products? If you are unaware  eating Gluten Free means you have an auto-immune disease called Celiac Disease  eating Gluten when you have Celiac disease means your body attacks your small intestine and in turn damages your digestive track leading to both long and short terms health problems ranging from vomiting  cramping and excessive bathroom use  to lasting damage to your digestive track and an inability to absorb nutrients from foods. It is not a choice  nor is it a fad diet.  An average supermarket stocks 80 000 different lines  your frozen gluten free section is two bays wide. And yet these are the products you have chosen to charge an extortionate amount on knowing full well that if a person with Celiac disease wants the modern convenience of a frozen pizza or chicken nuggets  they will have no choice but to spend over twice as much.   This not only goes for Gluten Free products  but also Lactose free and other items that you stock that adhere to people with food intolerances and allergies. Please explain to me why I feel like I am being discriminated against over a health issue I have no control over.",

    "post_message": "I m not one for having a moan at all but I have to say just how shockingly awful the service is in the Tesco in Watford. Made a special visit there today  battled the ques to get in and park kids in tow went to buy a tablet in the black Friday offer qued to pay with my clubcard  I wanted to use the money towards my purchase only to be told that i needed the voucher printed. So lost my place in the que went to find the printer machine... it was out of order ... asked the customer service lady what can be done? Her reply ... nothing. There is nothing tesco could do to help. The machine had been offline since last night and wasnt working. When i explained that wasnt my fault and asked if they could help me find another way round it i was told  go ask over there  so again i went to ask somebody else if they could help and was told to go home and print them myself. GREAT STUFF! Now bearing in mind our family spend thousands of pounds a year in that shop on our groceries and homeware AND the fact that I had the clubcard in hand I find it absolutely obsurd that no one was willing to help. I am appalled at the system or lack of systems that you have in place.  One machine that if it breaks in the biggest event of the year there isn t a back up or an alternative route to help your customers. So with two young children and one wasted journey I feel truly disappointed. Tesco can have all the high tech fruit smoking machines and expensive posh bakerys in the world but what matters most to a business like yours is providing excellent customer service and I m afraid to say Tesco Watford doesn t.",

    "post_message": "We went to your West Durrington store today  aiming to do a full food shop.  Unfortunately less than half way round my son filled his nappy which was unpleasant for him  us and anyone passing him.  So we had to make the decision between changing him on your toilet floor (grim) and finishing our food shop or paying for the few bits we had managed to collect and leaving to go home and changing him.  Pretty obvious which option we picked. So today when we would have spend over £100 in your shop we ended up spending less than £30.  We also would have stayed and had something to eat and drink in Costa Coffee but we couldn t because my son was so upset at being in a dirty nappy we had no choice but to leave. Shame really that you fail to provide better facilities so that he could have had the dignity you and I have and we could have cleaned him up and carried on our day instead of having to cut our trip short and return home where we will now probably stay for the rest of the day because its just easier not to go out. You provide toilets for all your other customers  men  women  children and babies  this store has a large disabled toilet as well.  Yet none of these were suitable for my son (or his friends who live locally) because he is 7 and is severely disabled so your baby changing table is far too small to hold his weight.   Please consider providing an adult sized changing table and a hoist to aid with lifting so that next time we can simply pause our shop and carry on our visit afterwards just like everyone else does.  This would benefit a huge number of people in and around the Worthing area who shop in Tesco - or who don t currently because of the lack of facilities but would like to.",

This has changed in the last few weeks while trying to get a Hatchimals. While I understand that there is a high demand for this toy I would like you to tell me how it s fair that even when you get a delivery of them they are not even making it to your shelves for the customer to buy!! On 3 separate occasions in 3 different stores I have being told that you are expecting a delivery but basically they have been taken by delivery drivers or staff before they even make it onto the shop floor. This included 2 late night trips into your stores. Now I know staff are entitled to some perks but surely it s unfair for this to keep happening so that customers don t even have a chance to buy this toy. Come Christmas morning my daughter and niece are going to be very disappointed that Santa couldn t deliver them this toy due to the probable greed of some of your staff. Fair enough if they are buying them for their children but I hope they are only allowed to buy 1 which seems to be the policy of a lot of stores.",

I tried to call back straight away and there was no answer  I tried calling several times and got not response.  I contacted you by phone and the fella told me that he doesn t need to pick up the phone!  I have a problem with that  firstly your staff are making all the effort to go around the warehouse/ store to pick up the ingredients. Then putting them into a basket for the driver  the drivers drives all the way to us and then he is too lazy to make an effort and is not obliged to pick up the phone. He ll drive all the way back and the stuff is put back  I don t know what you are considering saving money. But if you do that with every customer  it wouldn t surprise me if your going to losse money because of the laziness of your staff. (Btw everytime I go into a tesco there is at least one problem that I can point out to you)  Anyway  I m also being told that I will be refunded the full amount. That was 10 days ago and that hasn t happened yet. Maybe posting this on fb will get you to reply!?!  Cheers   Ryan",

This was an idea we came up with after I had been let down for some prior plans the same day  so I was looking forward to it.   Unfortunately. You apparently have to have I.D for Non alcoholic items too!! I had mine in my purse but my friend didn t  so we were refused. The lady seemed confused and called over another member of staff over too ask if we really needed I.D for non alcoholic items. She was very blunt even after I explained it s for my birthday and I m pregnant etc etc. (By the way I m quite obviously pregnant as I m 23 weeks with a big bump)   The lady on the till then said do you want the rest of your stuff  the bar kit (with plastic cocktail glasses and straws etc) and some juices (orange juice etc) we took a minute to decide as I was wondering if it was worth it without the grenadine (as that s what gives it a cocktail feel) we decided to purchase the rest of our items  the lady then proceeded to slam our receipt on top of our shopping quite rudely.   I m honestly very angry about all this  I think it s ridiculous that we should need our I.D for non alcoholic drinks. I d like to know why firstly... I ve never seen a law anywhere that says I.D is required for NON alcoholic drinks (beer wine champagne).

Annoyingly  whoever decides where the aforementioned ale resides on your shelves clearly doesn t know what they re doing as it s spread over no less than three different areas in the aisle (some with the lager  some with the beer and (most bizarrely) some with the alcopops.

Is there any chance you could rustle up a dedicated craft ale section on your shelves - it can t be too tricky as other (not to be named) competition seem to be able to manage.

There is no point I providing a stock checker on your website if the information is incorrect which then leads to a wasted journey. Perhaps your Hattersley branch is in need of a stock take to prevent this happening again.",

It was not just one thing but a number of things to the point that it made me so mad and disappointed. I felt very let down from Tesco and their staff!  I decided I was paying at a till as I still love the face to face of customer service I normally get at Tescos! I waited for ages while the 2 sales assistants put through and bagged. 1 just had a terrible attitude didn t want to be there at all and when I finally go there he asked did I have a bag... I explained while stopping my son from doing his own merchandising and I popped my bag down told my son to stop and the sales guy tutted and just stood there not engaging at all with myself but finishing scanning was chatting to the other sale assistant  I passed my club card and he was angry to deal with it and muted under his breath the total and I paired by card he put the receipt on my bag and then went off before I even got my card out of the reader! I enjoy shopping in your stores but I will not be doing so for a while as I am totally disgusted with his attitude and shocking lack of customer service  if he is a long standing member of staff he needs updating on his understanding on customer service as today s events show he has no understanding and if he is new your standards for choosing staff is seriously low to the point if I do come back to shop at that store and there are more sales assistants like that I would be totally disappointed and never shop with you again I do not wish that to be an option I expected better from you and your sales assistants after all they are the face of Tesco s",

    "post_message": "I m so upset right now after having to deal with Tesco Direct.  I placed on order on-line for the 3 for 2 offer and purchased 3 toys for my son on Saturday 19th November. I received an email to say all 3 items had been dispatched the next day  Sunday 20th. On Monday the 21st I then had a text to say 2 of the items were ready to collect  I thought I would wait for the 3rd to arrive and collect them all together.  By this morning I was getting a little concerned as I hadn t heard anything on the 3rd item so I called Tesco Direct  I was told that my item had definitely been dispatched and was just waiting to be collected from the warehouse. She than also said she was putting me on a stock alert as the item was out of stock in case my item didn t arrive. This set alarm bells ringing as if my item had definitely been dispatched why would it not arrive.  I went to my local store this afternoon to collect the 2 items that were waiting and discussed my concerns with the sales assistant who also seemed confused as if my item had been dispatched as stated on email and by the call centre staff  then it should have arrived. The sales assistant again called Tesco Direct to discuss my order. After a lengthy wait and being on hold it was confirmed my item was never dispatched as it is out of stock.  The item that is out of stock is the 1 present my son wants this year  other places had great deals on this item that weekend but as I was looking at other items with you it made great sense to benefit from the 3 for 2 offer.  The options I have been given is either stay on stock alert and hope it comes into stock or receive a refund for 1/2 the price of them item I haven t received which would then leave me out of pocket and have paid more than the other 2 items cost.   Item 1 cost £71.24 (out of stock) Item 2 cost £36.05 Item 3 cost £28.49  I paid £107.29 which is the total of item 1 and 2 and the 3rd was free.   I have been offered which I think is disgusting that if the item 1 does not come back on stock I will get a refund of 1/2 the value which works out at £35.62.  So not only through no fault of my own am I losing out on the 3 for 2 deal but I am also paying more than what the other 2 items were worth.  The total cost of item 2 and 3 is £64.54 if you take that from the £107.29 I paid it leaves £42.70. So why am I only getting a refund of £35.62. Meaning I ve paid £7.08 more than the 2 items I have received cost on the first place.  My money should not have been taken if the item was not available to be sold and now there s a good chance my son won t get the 1 thing he has asked for because it is out of stock everywhere.",

This is normally older people who can t be bothered to walk from wherever they park.  Today an older lady justified her parking in a parent and child bay by the fact that her husband has had a heart attack. Very sad indeed. But then she went on to say (when we suggested parking in the disabled bay)  that she couldn t park there cause she didn t have a disabled badge. Nevermind that... But the husband sat in the car waiting for her to do the shop. So did it really matter where the car was parked???  For me it isn t about the distance but the space around your car to be able to take your baby out of the car without being restricted by other cars parked next to you.

    "post_message": "Tesco   I have unfortunately been left very disheartened by your Peel Centre store over the course of the last 3 weeks and I am quite frankly rather disgusted with the service I have received!  In the last 3 weeks I have made around 20 visits to this store in a desperate attempt to purchase a Hatchimals Toy for a Christmas gift  each time I was repeatedly told to return on the next delivery day and try again. Whilst I understand that this is a very popular toy this Christmas I certainly did not expect to hear what I did at 1am this morning!  I was told to return to store at 10pm (expected delivery time) by your main customer service call centre  upon this visit I was then told that the delivery was not expected for another couple of hours and if I really wanted to I could return at 1am thus giving the staff enough time to unload their delivery etc. When I returned at 1am I was quite rudely told that staff were unable to sell the item as they had a very long list of customers phone numbers to offer them to first! I was never informed of this procedure by any member of staff in this store over the 3 week period nor by your customer service team and find it rather disgusting that whilst every other store is providing them on a first come first served basis  this store seems to be making its own rules up!  Please could you clarify what company policy is on this issue??",

    "post_message": "To Whom it May Concern    RE: Tesco Extra Sunbury   On 3rd November 2016 at around 19:20  I was a customer at your store  in Sunbury. Prior to entering your store  I was mugged of £250 at the cash point on your premises  for the use of your customers.   Upon being mugged  I ran inside and informed the security guard  who came outside  looked in the direction that the mugger ran and told me to call the police  without offering any support and to call them on my behalf or waiting with me whilst I called them. The security guard told me that he was new  and that he didn t know what to do  so was going to speak to the manager.   I called the police  with the support of a kind member of public  and they were there in good time  took DNA swabs  a full statement and were hopeful to obtain an outcome from either the DNA swabs from my hands or from your CCTV overlooking the cashpoint.   Considering I am a petite  22 year old young woman who was alone  I would have thought that a member of management or staff may have come out to ensure that I was okay  considering I was on your premises  using a service that you provide  with the intentions of purchasing products from this store. However  not one member of staff  asked if I was okay  offered me a drink or waited with me until the police arrived. Instead  I was left with strangers  all be it  they were luckily very kind members of the general public.   Following police investigation  today I have been informed by the police that the CCTV camera that I was relying on to provide some evidence  and show the crime being committed  does not record. The police have also informed me that management at this store said the CCTV cameras inside the building are the only ones that work  because they are for customer safety  implying that I was not a customer.   I am eager to know  why I was not a customer on that evening? I was using a service provided by Tesco at most  if not all of your stores  with every intention of using the store after I had withdrawn my money. As a local person  I would normally use your store on a regular basis  at least 3 times per week. But I am not a customer?  Since this event  I have only been to your store if accompanied  with the exception of day light hours. I did however  have to nip in to this store this evening  and on my way back to my car  which I parked close to the building  I became overwhelmed with panic and ended up running to my car and locking the doors.   I am aware that it is unlikely that the person who will find and respond to this message probably doesn t work in the stores  however I would like to know what is going to be done by Tesco  moving forward in order to protect myself and other customers (or non customers as Sunbury management believes) when using the store  or the services provided on the premises.   I look forward to your response.   Kind Regards  Megan Bardini",

The girl said that s the only key hang on I ll speak to my colleague  she spoke to her colleague and her colleague said I ve just given the key to someone else what do you expect me to do about it!!!!! Well as you can imagine after being spoken to like that we left the store and went elsewhere.. put a complaint in with customer services team and all I get is another customer left the store with the key sorry. The keys have those security tags on that set off the bleepers so why weren t they stopped? I ve had a email back siding with the staff which I knew the were going to do and a half hearted sorry  the manner in which she spoke left me upset and feeling like being disabled was my own fault and a hinderence to others. Well I m sorry I didn t choose to be disabled but I do have a choice where to shop and it certainly won t be with tesco!!!!!!

We got back to the car safely but on driving out  heading down the slight hill towards the petrol station  there is a zebra crossing.  A very frail old man was waiting to cross and I hit the breaks  car went from 2nd gear to 1st  and wouldn t stop.  I had to pull my handbreak on  nearly hit a lamp post and did a 360 degree turn  with my baby in the car  in order to miss the old man due to black ice/  This is absolutely ridiculous.  I did speak to a member of staff  about it but was told that someone would be out soon to grit the area.  OK  but many elderly people like to get out early to do their shopping  never mind the likes of me who prefers to shop with a baby before its bus   and I find it extremely  irresponsible that Tesco do not have someone designated on these frosty days to ensure customers safety.  its not like its an irregular occurance at this time of year that there is ice.    I am a very loyal shopper but to be honest I will rethink where I shop due to the car parking situation for my and my baby s safety.

At the time of ordering .. now given they re all paid for and where in stock and I have email confirmation of the order I would expect all items I have ordered and paid for would be delivered tomorrow as planned .. well how wrong was i.. get a phone call tonight one item is out of stock .. when I asked why as I have ordered and the money has been taken from my bank and received by Tesco there for the items are mine and should not be sold again as they have already been bought .. apparently Tesco you don t feel that s something you should do and so continued to let the item go out of stock and I was met with  it doesn t mean is reserved  well no mate it doesn t as it s been bought and paid for it means it s (or should be) mine .. and so in simple terms Tesco you have sold an item that belongs to me I have proof of purchase therefore it is incredibly unreasonable and unacceptable that you ve done so . To add insult to injury this item was in the three for two and one of the more expensive items (£33) so I said ok so your refunding the £33 then I was met with no .. you will be paying full price for the item that again I have proof of purchase for and should of been and shows on the receipt as the free item as now (through no fault of my own one item is it if stock and I m not eligible for the 3 for 2 deal) so not only is one of my sons Christmas presents not arriving tomorrow but you also are refusing to refund me the full price of it .... if I had known this would of been the case I would of shopped elsewhere and will likely be doing so from now on . I have been very loyal customer I shop with you weekly for food and also for my children s school uniforms   Christmas and birthday presents and have spent upwards of £300 on toys in the last week from you guys ..  .. I have spoken to numerous people who agree this situation is appalling  and extremely bad practice ..",

I was shopping alone for some essentials when my 11 week old daughter started kicking off. I decided that enough was enough and went to pay for my items. That s how I came across Kath  a member of your team. She told me to take my time and how can she help. Kath helped with my daughter whilst I sorted her feed and put my shopping on the belt. I couldn t grab the trolley when feeding her so the lady working on the checkout next to me brought it down along with my shopping. Kath then pushed my trolley over to the bench so I could sit and feed her comfortably. I m so grateful for how Kath helped me and stopped me from stressing out lol. She s a credit to your company!! If you could pass the message on that would be great!! Thank you again. Regards. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0080>",

    "post_message": "At the moment I have 3 very disappointed granddaughters and am very disappointed myself with Tesco customer service!! My 10 year old granddaughter was lucky enough to win a family cinema ticket to see the new Trolls movie at our local Tesco extra in Pool Redruth Cornwall. At the time of entering we didn t realise that there was no odeon cinemas in Cornwall and that if she was lucky enough to win she would need to travel well over a 100 miles to take up the prize. She was delighted when her mum received the email telling her that they had won but imagine her disappointment when they looked to see where the nearest odeon was Exeter or Taunton!! Practically up country to us way down in Cornwall!! So I phoned Pool Tesco today and spoke to a very nice man who tried his best to help with changing the tickets but unfortunately it was out of his control and gave me the number for your head office customer service. Unfortunately the lady there was not so helpful!! She said she was sorry that my granddaughter was upset but it was an odeon promotion and out of Tesco s hands. When I questioned this she told me not to shout which I was most certainly not doing!! she said she couldn t speak to me if I raised my voice which if the conversation was recorded I think you will find I was not doing and yes I probably sounded angry as I am and upset for my granddaughter and with Tesco for making no effort to help!! She also said that the adult with my granddaughter should of check first before entering but obviously she assumed it was local!! So my question is why have a promotion in Cornwall why not check first and make it acceptable to all making sure there is an cinema taking part in the region!!what would happen if they are unable to take up the prise is there an alternative or will it just go to someone else which will upset her even more??",

I got an email saying it would be delivered into store on 10/11/16.  Date came and went with no confirmation of delivery.  I want to the store on 18/11/16 to see if it had arrived and I hadnt been sent confirmation but sadly it hadnt arrived.  The lady I spoke to at the store was very helpful and apologetic that my order wasnt there.  She took my number said she would look into it and call me back and as promised she called me later that day to say it had been delivered to the wrong store and it had been re-ordered for me and would be re delivered into my local store (Market Harborough).  I got an email to say it would be delivered into store on 22/11/16.  I got text alerts saying it was going to delivered on the 22nd but I didnt get any confirmation that it had been delivered so I then checked the delivery address only to find yet again it has gone to the wrong store 53 miles away from me!!!!  Come on Tesco is it that difficult to send my order to the correct place  it is one of your own stores after all????? What now another attempted delivery to another incorrect store???  I ordered these for a Christmas gift for my godson who lives in Ireland  a family member was going to take them over for me but as they fly out tomorrow morning I will now have the added expense of posting them or waiting and taking them with me when I go to see him next year. Another fail by Tesco direct (completely separate order) just last week I ordered a printer cartridge to be sent to my local store.  I placed and paid for the order only to have an email 2 hours later saying its not in stock so they have cancelled my order and will process a refund which took 3 days why don t they know their stock levels? Ive only placed 4 orders with Tesco Direct and 2 of them have been a disaster  do I want to use Tesco Direct again? At this moment in time Im thinking no!

After waiting for ages in the que with just one person on the till i finally got served  i was cashing in my coinstar money. I explained to the woman that a member of staff told me the night before that i could cash it in today as customer service was closed after 10pm last night & she replied with a straight no so i then asked her how i can get my £15 because im not wasting £15 of my money and she just told me no again and to ring the number on the receipt so i then told her that her staff has been giving out wrong information to customers then because they told me i could still cash it in!! I was disgusted by her lack of customer service she gave me & didn t even look at my receipt so i happily rang head office and they told me to bring it back in store as i should of had my money in the first place !i was happy with the other lady who served me as she herself questioned why a member of staff didn t cash it in the first place & with it having the tesco information on the receipt should of been cashed in still regardless of what day it was printed! Was not happy with the service and the woman who refused me needs to learn on her customer skills because i don t think she knew what she was doing anyways!",

    "post_message": "Initial complaint on the 27th October still had no contact back regarding this from the  relevant  person. Your company practices a zero customer service level. I am guessing like most people I spend on average £400 a month within your stores and petrol stations  meaning £4800 annually and nearly a quarter of million in a lifetime  obviously you could not give a toss about my custom so I am now forced to shop with Sainsburys instead.   I have had 3 fob off emails 2nd  9th and 18th from Amanda Clark.   This my initial complaint and responses.   Order ref:19218800  Yesterday evening our delivery arrived at our door with 12 free range eggs on top of the crates  as per your standard practice  except every single egg was smashed with all of their contents covering the rest of our order. This in turn went all over our carpet and was spread through the hallway and kitchen. We had to wash everything before drying it and then putting them away  plus scrubbing our carpet and mopping the kitchen. The driver was apologetic  however this is not the first issue we have had with the online service  although it is the first time I have decided to voice this to yourselves. We have always shopped with you guys either in store or online as I am sure you can see from my clubcard  but the so called convenience of online is not what I experienced last night after getting home from work. I encourage you to smash 12 eggs and see just how much mess this creates  plus the inconvenience of then not having 12 eggs that you ordered.  I made a complaint last week reference this order. I was called by your HQ on 27th at 10:06am and they were very understanding of my issue and said that a member of staff would call me shortly from the Aylesford depot with a resolution. Someone then called me from a mobile number 07718 534425 at 10:23am I had to explain my issue all over again to him  he then said that he will call me back in the next few minutes once he had spoken to his manager. That phone call never came  so I called back at 16:53 and spoke to a woman who was very rude abrupt and unhelpful. I asked her if someone could call me back first thing in the morning  something that again never happened. I rang the main customer service number on the 28th at 15:52 and was told there is nothing that could be done until the depot call me. We are now Monday and I have heard nothing. It is obvious to me that my custom means nothing to Tesco so I will not be shopping with your brand anymore.",

I was told by a man that I was texted at 9am saying that delivery was 45mins late. I kindly told the man that I hadn t got this text hence my call.  So I waited  and waited and waited. nOTHING! I call again at 13:52 and spoke to a very helpful man called Tom. He politely apologised for the unconvinced and said he ll look into this  he even offered to call me back. I replied with  no thank you I ll hold .. Tom put me on hold  so he could look at notes and contact driver. After some time Tom came back and said that he can t reach the driver. Drivers log states he was back in store at 12:08 as round done. Well obviously it wasn t as I haven t received my food shop. He said he will contact the branch and was I ok to still hold. Well of course i was. Tom came back and said that the store (Erith) had told him  that the driver was out of he s hours. So has returned to store with my shopping as well as another customers. This was extremely frustrating as firstly I was told after first call that it was running 45 mins behind then To be told that driver was out of there hours. Well how can they be if they already know it s running 45 mins late  then surely they already know if the driver is going too be at end of he s shift!!!!! Yet I m still waiting and no contact has been made to apologise or let me know. Tom said that the store (Erith) has said that both deliveries will be out for this afternoon drop of 14:00-18:00. This is a joke and an insult  I booked a time slot  in fact an hour time slot. The most frustrating part is that I have now had to spend this time chasing delivery and typing this post. I was due to go to hospital at 2pm as my mum has had a stroke and these are the visiting times. Now I m late seeing her and having to cut the time short to rearrange childcare. No consideration given by the store what so ever. This is not the first time either!! Extremely disappointed in the customer service given by the Erith branch. If it wasn t for Tom  I would still be in the dark as to where my delivery is. I ve now had to get my neighbour to sit at mine to wait for delivery. One very disappointed customer!!!  Whilst I have been typing I have received a good will gesture voucher for £10. His doesn t help with the lack of customer service shown and the fact I m still having to add more stress to my plate to sort out my shopping being delivered.",

I am writing in regards to a particuarly nasty and upsetting incident this lunch time.  Just been to the Tesco Express in broadmead and slipped over on a broken white wine bottle (so am here in my office with a painful knee and stinking of booze).  The staff inside the staff were not helpful or sympathetic in any way.  The way you can rectify this would be by doing 2 things: 1)  Train your staff in how to deal with spillages.  When something is spilled  get a member of staff to stand by the spill and direct people round it whilst another goes to get a wet floor sign.  This is very basic (was when I worked in a supermarket) but wasn t done.  Customers were (hurriedly) walking though the liquid and glass with no warning.   2)  Train your staff on customer service.  When staff see someone is hurt they should show empathy.  They should ask whether the customer is OK  and possibly help them to their feet.  They shouldn t just say  they re cleaning there... .  I was obviously embarrassed after crashing to the floor  in pain  worried about possible glass in my knees or clothing and got no support from the staff.  The cleaner who was in the area (I assume dealing with another spill/another part of the spill) didn t even make eye contact.",

    "post_message": "I had a thoroughly unpleasant shopping experience today in your Tesco Extra store in Hastings. Maybe not your fault directly  but your crappy customers! Turned up with my nearly 3 year old and 3 month old  only shopping here as I could park underground. Drive to the parent and baby spits and could I get one? No. drove round twice. Finally  saw one man sat in his car  door open. Clearly no intention of leaving. Drove along a bit and a woman was sat in her car  lights on. Sat indicating behind her until another driver came behind me and felt unable to see I was waiting for a spot and therefore drive around me. So I gave up. And parked over two spots to enable me to get my doors open fully so as to access the car seats safely. By the time I had the kids put the car - along with my changing bag and bag of bags - I started walking to where the baby trollies are and the second parking spot hogger leaves - with no baby or small person in her car!! Oh yes  she had a car seat  but it was very much empty!! So this selfish cow knows what it s like to take small children shopping  yet still feels so entitled that she takes a spot when alone!! (If you are reading this love  I hope you struggle getting parked somewhere suitable the next time that car seat is occupied!!)   So as I say  this is obviously not your fault but maybe you could have a few more baby spots?? Maybe some that could be parent and child OR disabled to go alongside those you already have?? Or maybe you could find people abusing these spots?? I bet a month of someone s wages would be recouped in a week from people parking there with no kids or with teenagers sat in the car! Or those really annoying ones where one parent stays in the car with the kids and the other goes in - why do they need the spot??  I m thoroughly wound up now today and blame Tesco s entirely!!",

    "post_message": "If this is true I will be changing my provider!!!  A Tesco store in Edinburgh has been accused of discriminating against state school children by making them queue outside while private school pupils are allowed to come and go as they please.  It has been claimed that students from Boroughmuir high school  near the city centre  were made to stand behind a barrier by Tesco staff and only allowed to enter their local store in small groups. But students at the nearby George Watsons college were not stopped at all.  The issue was raised by a parent of one child at the state school  who said it was a form of discrimination. Neil Pollock  a professor of innovation and social informatics at Edinburgh university  said: Everybody should queue or nobody should queue.  Advertisement  He told the Guardian: My son is at Boroughmuir. He has to stand in the queue each day. Hes not one to complain but it was getting him down - so we decided to do something. He and his friends are frustrated because they have to wait outside whilst others go ahead of them. Tesco also police the door in that they have a person there making sure they queue.  Pollock said the pupils were pretty angry about the situation  saying his son and his friends were really pleased that some one is finally taking it up for them. They dont want to get into trouble  or to present their school in a bad light but they just think it is unfair.  He said his son  who he asked not to be named  once tried to walk in behind a group of students from George Watsons college. The staff member sent him  but not the Watsons boys  out off the shop.  Pollock posted his complaint on Twitter last week and a Tesco representative responded with a series of tweets  telling him: Ive called the store and spoke to the duty manager  John... He said the private school normally have a lesser amount of children which is quicker and easier for the store.  After Pollock indicated he was not happy with that explanation  a Tesco representative tweeted: I agree we cannot have different rules.",

Loving the Xmas decs  btw.  As a reward for getting round your store without stocking up on Krispy Kremes or spending wayyyyyy too long in the clothes aisles I decided to get myself my usual refreshing treat. Your finest freshly squeezed lemonade. I know  not exactly rock and roll  but I like it! Or  at least  I did. I know that change can be a good thing  but the old saying goes  if it ain t broke  don t fix it  and it s especially true in this case.   This lovely refreshing treat of mine used to taste as if you d been hit in the face with a bag of lemons thrown out of a lemon yellow beetle on international lemon day (Tuesday August 29th 2017  btw). Now  it tastes like water that knew a lemon once. Or rather  it was a friend of a friend of a lemon  but that totally counts  right? And don t even get me started on the distinct lack of sweetness in this once wonderfully sweet and sour drink!   Wrong  Tesco  it doesn t count. Not even slightly. Please bring back my lemony treat!

In a phone call today from Andrew one of your  customer care representatives  when I asked if anyone knew what they were doing because there s so much back and forth and even now I m being told contradicting information from an email he sent me this morning to what I was told in the phone call this afternoon... Andrew response to me was  well it s actually caused us quite a lot of problems trying to sort this out on your behalf  I had tried to contact the manufacturer directly as I specified many times and they told me they had to deal with tesco directly  even sent Andrew the emails to show him this. As a customer care representative is it not your duty to help and sort out problems - not moan to the customer that it s been an issue. I m fully aware it s been an issue I ve been trying to sort this out for a month!!!! He also doesn t seem to be very happy at sorting this out for me cus he added in the phone call  well we ve done our job by offering a replacement mattress ... As if that just sorts out the whole problem... CONGRATS  perhaps you d like to deliver it to me and then I will say you ve done your job properly...... I ve asked several times how I can make a complaint and not happy with the way Andrew has spoken with me today  he even sighed on the phone when I asked him a question.... I think he might be a bit fed up....I presume all your calls are recorded. I think this whole situation has been an absolute joke and I still haven t had it sorted..... In our phone call today Andrew said they attempted to deliver the mattress last week (to an old work address) but no one was in (someone is there from 7-7) and it has been  left with a neighbour and they don t know who... And no information was left at the address it should of been delivered to about where it is.... Now instead of sending out another mattress for me which I feel would be the correct thing to do in this situation and stop messing me around ...... I have to wait for him to contact the couriers  see where they ve left it  wait for them to collect it from this address and try and get them to deliver it to my home address...... Not really sure why I have to be involved in all of that",

    "post_message": "Hi Tesco  I think your customers need to know what happened to me today because of Tesco s Direct. I ordered a TV and Soundbar to the tune of £400. It gave me the option to choose a day to deliver  and no option to pick it up from the store. I chose today and got an email to say they would be delivered today  CUSHTY! 11 oclock this morning  the soundbar arrived! YAY! I checked the tracking on the TV to see.. READY TO DISPATCH. Ok  I thought  lets wait  (I took the day of work for this). I chose to have it delivered today as tomorrow I have to drive 300 miles to my grandfathers funeral and then 300 miles back so won t be home  work on wednesday and the sky engineer coming out on thursday. 5pm rolls around  no sign of a tv  tracking still says READY TO DISPATCH!!! So I call the phone number on the website and was told someone will find out whats going on and call me back  no call back after an hour so I call you again....told someone will ring me back in 15 minutes  half an hour later I get the call to be told that the courier has made a mistake and only received my tv today so it is no where near to being dispatched  I would have to wait until thursday at the latest!!! Another day off work!!! I don t think so!   I did ask about a refund  5 days until the money goes back on my card  still not solving the problem of me having a tv by thursday when the sky engineer comes round. Absolutely shocking customer service! I even asked if we could have a credit put on the account so we can go to our local store to collect another one  but no  apparently this can t be done. I was given two different reasons for the mistake  1) the tv only arrived in the warehouse today so there was no chance it would be delivered today anyway (No call to let me know so i could go to work) and 2) it couldn t get here because of the weather!!! My soundbar made it ok so that doesn t wash im afraid! Finally  after talking to many staff members including a manager  I have been assured that I will get a call tomorrow (tuesday) to see if someone can give me a time slot for the delivery on wednesday instead so I don t have to take the whole day off. Lets see if this happens ",

I really hope this helps as I am desperate to sleep for longer than 40 minutes at a time before the dreaded high pitched buzzing invades my head!!!  This is a plea to all households and businesses situated around the Tesco store on Springs Lane.  For years a high pitched buzzing sound has been emitting from its roof top (?cooling system) and causing an extreme nuisance to nearby properties to the point that it s not possible to have any windows open during the night. This issue has been raised with Tesco on numerous occasions but with no satisfaction despite their understanding of the situation. Since last Thursday this has been particularly bad and very intrusive especially throughout the night and this his has got to stop! Would everyone who is affected by this please go into the store and resister your concern with the manager or write a post on here and I will ensure it s passed on.  Many thanks.",

    "post_message": "Dear Tesco  I am writing on behalf of my elderly parents   who have had £104 worth of online Tesco vouchers stolen by fraudsters. They only just discovered this  and when contacting Tesco were told that a person had phoned up in August  impersonating them  and had been authorised to use the vouches. It has not been explained to them how the fraudster managed to either bypass or complete the security checks I assume were in place. They are therefore understandably extremely concerned that this could easily happen again. Most importantly  the have been told that the vouches will only be returned to them in February. I m afraid that this is completely unacceptable. My father is in his late 70s  and they were saving these vouchers to use at Christmas. These vouchers were stolen through no fault of their own  and I feel it is wrong that their Christmas should suffer because of it. My parents are loyal Tesco customers  and I feel they deserve to be treated better than this. I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible and let me know how we can get this process expedited. Thank you  Emma Butterworth",

I requested to speak to a supervisor because I do not think this is fair practice  I was told they will call and they have not as yet. I won t be compensated for my time or money that is not in my bank and my son may not get what he wants for Christmas.

Thanks   Utter Utter Utter (did is say Utter??) Rubbish!!!  Wish there had been a zero star. Bought first one and experienced the issue with the memory card corrupting the screen on boot up  bought a new (expensive sandisk) memory card  and the problem remained. Went to the garage in Carluke and got a really unhelpful assistant to eventually (after an argument) to swap it out. Got home  camera worked ok with the memory card. Daughter used it on a school trip -- went to look at the pictures  and the camera had wiped them. Paid for an app to recover the pictures from the card (which it did)  only to find the picture quality is absolute rubbish. there is no way this camera is the 720 advertised  needless to say  it will be going back to tesco tomorrow. Best advice -- dont touch this camera with a barge pole. 30 odd quid then a memory card on top is a rip off for this rubbish. £5 would be more appropriate.",

Your live chat is also down so I can not talk to someone directly. I am unable to phone. I have filled our your contact form but as that might take a few days for a reply I thought I would message on here too. I have received two texts today telling me my order would be an hour late. At least you had the courtesy to text this time  most of the time it is half an hour late with no warning. It seems like since I have had the delivery saver you don t care when my orders get to me as you already have my money. I have complained before and received an apology but no assurances that it wouldn t happen regularly. If you say you will deliver between certain times then the majority of your deliveries should be within that time  something which has not currently been happening. I have used Tesco deliveries for the past 7 years and the only time  up until the past few months that I had a problem with delivery was when the delivery was cancelled due to snow  which is obviously not your fault. I am getting fed up with having to make sure I am available for 2 hours around my 1 hour time slot. I get the deliveries for convenience but having to wait around for an extra hour is not convenient at all. As I stated on the contact form I filled out  I would like this to be looked into.

I started a new job u see  so I thought  I am going to treat myself to a new phone. So I paid off my contract handset  and bought myself a nice shiny new Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. In beautiful Rose gold. I was so chuffed! Well  after shelling out over £700 on my handset and paying off my old handset  i was pretty chuffed with myself. Well imagine my disappointment when just 3 weeks (nearly 4) later I decide to get insurance on my phone  to be told by tesco I can t buy said policy. I asked for a copy of my receipt as mine had got damaged slightly in the rain  to be told flatly  no  incase I am  trying to fiddle tesco . Well I can assure you that I am not trying to fiddle you  just trying to protect my phone. To add insult to injury  the case that I Bought from your store also broke my phone slipped out of it and guess what?.........I have a smashed screen that I am not insured for! Who would have thought? Well I have decided that I have thrown enough money at tesco now  and I will take my custom elsewhere. I am disgusted. You sell shoddy goods and your staff are  simply put  Rude.  Oh and that job I got.......Yeah  I work for O2. The company that provides YOUR net work services.

I feel it is time to do this. I live very near to the small Tesco on Myrtle Parade in Liverpool  (near the university).   I have to say i don t like the shop because my ethical stance is very strongly against self service tills. Most people in Liverpool will know what machine one is describing if the term  job killer  is used. I often find the shop over crowded and don t like having to wait in a queue for a long time because of understaffing if the option is to use one of those things. I could complain about problems or sometimes other members of staff there and regularly walk past the shop several blocks to use the Co-Op.   Having said that you have at least one excellent staff member and I think it is worth Tesco noting this. I read her name badge and she is called Alison. She has consistently been welcoming  good-humoured and friendly. She is efficient and serves quickly and tonight while serving I noticed her genuinely listening to the customer in front of me. (I don t now her in case you think I am one of her friends but) I just think good staff should be commended or even promoted if possible.

I received my Tesco delivery last night when unpacking my shopping well i mean before carrying it up the stairs as I live in an upstairs flat I noticed that a bottle of bleach had been leaking and was all over my hands work pants and my carpet runner at the bottom of my stairs. Meanwhile my 3 year son was helping me with the shopping as he does every week which the tesco delivery man witnessed . I called straight away to explain the situation. The bleach had been placed upside down in a bag than did not have handles and hadn t been tied at the top. I was refunded some of my chilled items where thr spilage had went into and sent an a voucher for £5 for the inconvenience.£5 I think that s an absolute insult I ve had to go out today and replace the goods. Whole idea of doing online shopping is that s it s more convenient to me . I was advised a manager would call me back today as the guy I spoke with last night couldn t get through to the team needed but was promised a call today. So 6pm this evening still no call so I have telephoned myself to me told my details hadnt been passed on and all the managers  and all the managers had finished at 4pm.

My question is how can u send the jiffy bag to the wrong address and send the bills to the good one? And by the way  we waited from last week and didn t received the jiffy bag. My wife had to make another contract with another provider so she can have a phone so we can communicate between us and with our family.

Who now will not eat the apple as he was made to feel  naughty   I m shocked by the way we were treated  why give out free fruit to children if you then belittle them and their parents  in front of the store:   It s safe to say we won t be taking tesco up on any free fruit while we shop  if we choose to shop there again.

(Maybe have a look at your stores cleaning standards to stop issues like this especially being such a  reputable company ) I asked your colleague to check if there was more in stock due to the dirt at the bottom of the coat. She did kindly check for me and offered me 10% off the coat. So I firstly accepted this. When I went to the customer service desk to complete the transaction I was then told that the coat would be none returnable! When my friend questioned why she was ignored by your customer service colleague by the name of  Bev  so then I had to say can you not ignore my friend please  she stated it is what is because we have discounted it. So if anything else had gone wrong with the coat I wouldn t have been able to return it. And all because of how dirty this particular store was?  Bev  wasn t very helpful at all  and I was having my consumer rights penalised due to the state of your stock? How is this acceptable? I was in desperate need of a coat due to circumstances out of my control to then be spoken too and treated like that - again down to the quality of the lack of cleanliness. Absolutely shocking is an understatement. Totally disappointed.",

    "post_message": "No Toast to Tesco.  On-line purchasing. So convenient. You select the goods on the website. You opt for click and collect. The supplier confirms the transaction. Days later you go to the collection-point but leave empty handed. There is no record of your transaction on your account with the trader. But your credit card bill clearly shows the amount has been credited to the trader. Sounds like a dodgy Ebay  perhaps from the far East?  Well. Cheshunt is East of Watford but this is not Ebay. Its Tesco Direct.  My £18 toaster purchase from Tesco Direct was purchased on a Friday  confirmed on line and the money credited to Tesco on my credit card statement. But five days later my entire purchasing record showed only a lawn mower from some four years before. There was no record of the toaster purchase.  Happily a thirty minute telephone call with a courteous and very helpful Ms Tesco straightened it out.  But the moral is: caveat emptor does not only apply to Ebay. Check your purchase confirmation not just on the Tesco website  but also have you received their email with reference number  and importantly - is your latest purchase recorded in your Tesco account. Saves the buyer and the lovely Ms Tesco a lot of time",

Anyways I was then told I d been refunded  I d be charged again tomorrow and re delivered....BUT my refund could actually take a week to go back into my account. Well I m a single mum of 3 young children the money I used to pay for my shopping which you took out of my account was the last of my money  so how am I meant to pay for it again tomorrow? I literally have nothing in my kids need to be fed! I was then told the only chance of me getting my shopping without paying for it was a re-drop...which he was 99.9% sure that wouldn t happen (even though I d been offered 3 different delivery times prior) so unless I pay for my shopping again (with no money as I ve used it all on my shopping which I d already paid for) I m not going to get it or my money back for anything up to a week! So firstly can you please explain to me how I m supposed to feed my 3 children for the week? Secondly why wasn t I even informed my shopping delivery wasn t coming?

This is however normally of no concern  but I have a small amount of foods that i can eat. Literally it is about 10-15 items  most of which I normally buy from the  free from  section.   These were my one snack that I could eat like having a bag of crisps and didn t cost the earth  plus they saved me on numerous occasions from being doubled over in pain. So not only have I lost something that kept me going I am also laying with my head beside a bucket because corn flour has been added to the nachos.   I know it is not your fault that I can t eat anything else  but is there any way I can get the old ones again. Seriously I have been buying almost 7 packs a week for months. Also it would have been great to have had some sort of notice that they have been changed to prevent me spending most of the day unwell.  Many thanks",

The lady in question kept walking and informed the other lady who was assisting that I needed help. I found this to be unhelpful and wasting of time.

    "post_message": "I m rather concerned with the packaging of certain items within Tesco  I was shopping in your Transit Way  Plymouth store yesterday and liked the look of your Rainbow Coleslaw http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=291760582 I noticed that all 3 items on the shelf had their paper/cardboard seal broken  I assumed there would be a cellophane seal inside so I lifted the lid to find NOTHING  if I had been  that sort of person  I could have put my finger in for a taste  or added ANYTHING to the coleslaw and replaced the lid!! Luckily enough I m not made like that so instead I removed all 3 from the shelf and set off to find a member of staff  eventually found a cleaner who helpfully went out the back to find someone. He then came out and explained that the seals  always get broken   there s not much they can do about it  he finally agreed to remove the items from sale. but my guess is that they will be back on the shelf today. What security measures do you have  to make sure that these items dont get  tampered ?",

Sadly I have resulted in sarcastic tack ticks to get my point across  the way that this is being handled is an absolute joke. I fear that you are praying on the vulnerable parents who for whatever reasons do not want to disappoint their children at Christmas just  to get people into your stores  then to be faced with a big fat NO or we haven t had any for weeks  no idea when stock will be coming in when clearly your website which is sending alerts for local stores that you have limited stock. How can this be when you get to said store and they haven t had any for several weeks. Also when you call said store and ask the kind gentleman on the phone who then confirms they have three green draggles and two pink so you race to said store and then to be told the same story  NO STOCK. How can you be advertising online to say limited stock and then to call and be told they have 5 in total in store to then drive to the store and they have none in stock?? I feel like you need to give an explanation  The lady on Customer services said that this had happened on several occasions over the weekend but yet the local web still says as I am writing this that the shop has limited stock. This is why I am convinced that you are using underhand techniques to get people to store so they are disappointed and heartbroken that they will then chose to purchase something else from your store. Bravo Tesco on your marketing and advertising departments you should be very proud. Or is it that you are getting them in stock and staff are beating the public to it and selling them for outrageous amounts on various selling websites? Either way I think I can safely say that TESCO will not be my chosen supermarket anymore having been let down far too many times.  Merry Christmas Tesco",

After trying to pt the card on my bill i received an amended order conformation by email - this time with my savings of £7.40 not taken off the total.

Both of us were in The Monday Mood and inevitably  being 4  Aurora was frankly really doing my head in. I d much rather have gone straight home but being a Single Lady I have cats and they needed some of your finest cat food.  Most of the way round the store Aurora insisted on pushing the trolley and after too many near misses to count I made her sit in it (and yes there was an argument about it). As we reached the self scan checkouts I told her not to mess about pulling the trolley back and forth as the last time she did this she trapped her fingers. I told her this no less than four times. Of course I was ignored and the fingers were trapped.  I had very little sympathy and even less patience at this point but The Lovely Lady (who s name I missed) who works on the self scan checkouts at your store had lots of sympathy and patience. She  pulled out a bag of sweeties from her drawer for Aurora and put a big smile on both our faces and it reminded me to take a deep breath  Monday s don t last forever!  Of course this didn t last long because Aurora then insisted on getting in the car by herself and somehow managed to trap her head in the door so my deep breaths kind of stopped working.  But anyway  I thought it was lovely of your team member to be so kind and caring when I was clearly at my wits end so I thought I d share my story with you and hopefully my appreciation will find it s way back to The Lovely Lady so she can know she put a smile on two weary faces on such a dreary Monday evening. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BB>",

I m a part time wheelchair user but when it comes to shopping I have to use my wheelchair due to the pain from various illnesses. We couldn t see any wheelchair trolleys so we asked at customer service just in case they had moved them. We were told they were all broken and we re waiting for new ones  and that was that no offer of assisted shopping  which I know is offered due to working in retail over 12 years ago. I was absolutely fuming because we now could not do the big shop we needed to do or use the voucher because I cannot wheel myself or keep a basket on my lap due to my health.  Surely all the disabled trolleys did not break all at once? So why leave it until they all break to order new ones? And why was no assistance offered? Was it because we are a young couple because I always see plenty of elderly people who are in better health than myself getting the assistance they need  but younger disabled people get ignored and swept to the side with a not my problem attitude?  I barely socialise due to anxiety so shopping is my release and common place I know and we always go at a quiet time due to this but today my anxiety hit me very hard because of the way I was treated as a disabled customer! It takes away your freedom when little things like this happen  if they were all being used then ok but the fact that no one had the common sense to order new ones when they re tatty old ones started breaking one by one I do not know?! Some people will think this is a pathetic small problem but to someone who is disabled it s not small  it means we lose a bit of independence that we try so hard to keep.",

They both went above and beyond their jobs to try and help me  it is much appreciated. Unfortunately that is where the thank you s and appreciation end. My food shopping delivery which was due today  has had to be returned to store  leaving my  my husband  and my children of ages 11  9  3 and 4 months without food  nappies and baby milk. My food shopping came to £74.09  of which I was paying £51 from my clubcard vouchers  and the remaining £23.09 from my debit card. Order put through online no problems  email confirmation received and clubcard vouchers showing on my clubcard account as spent. No problems right?? WRONG!! According to your customer services  I needed the full amount of £74.09 in my bank account in order for you to take the payment  and as this wasn t the case I couldn t have my delivery. Not once on my order  emails  tesco website... In fact NOWHERE  does it state that the full amount needs to be available funds - if it did  or I actually had the full amount available  I wouldn t have wanted to use my clubcard vouchers now would I?! Because of this I now have no food  no baby milk and no nappies  and I am going to have to drag my 4 children out in the cold and borrow money to do my food shopping until my clubcard vouchers can be reissued and used. Absolutely appalling service tescos  I am disgusted at you.",

There s hardly any food to choose from  but theres chips of course  with a side of chips if you like! But that s fine  I got a sausage roll with some. The staff as lovely as they are  dont really seem to know what they re doing and struggled with taking payment and serving customers.

    "post_message": "I tried to return two pairs of girls boots yesterday with no joy.  I have a new dog with a fetish for shoes!  17 pairs to date have ended up in the big shoe box in the sky.  I bought said shoes for school in September as they seemed a better price if they did one day end up in Rupert s paws £16 each pair.  After 6 weeks the sole came adrift on one of the boots right up to the heel.  What a state she must have looked her teacher had celotaped it back together to get her home.  Oh ek. I thought.  Knowing I hadn t paid so much for them still left me disappointed with the quality.  Tesco is a good brand!  Oh well as I don t live in Bridlington I m not making a special trip.  Last week my eldest girl came home with exactly the same issue.  I took them back yesterday and was greeted by the clothing manager.  I explained my disappointment.  She told me they looked far older than 6/8 weeks old and as I hadn t got my receipt I couldn t prove it.  I said my girls were only 8 and 10. I would have expected them to grow out of them before they fell apart.  The manager pointed out that they were not leather and we re very scuffed.  I pointed out that I was not complaining about them being scuffed that they had not my expectations as a Tesco product.  The manager was very curt.  she made me feel humiliated and embarrassed in front of other customers basic asking me to prove it.  I am very disappointed with how a Tesco manager could be rude  I felt she was questioning my integrity.  Every little helps.. I don t think so!",

Although I am aware that Tesco must get inundated with a multitude of promotional requests  I would like to think that you care enough about aiding our childhood obesity crisis to at least acknowledge someone who is trying to aid the weight and well-being of children for free - particularly as you ve recently introduced a free fruit for kids scheme!!

    "post_message": "I have to say im totally disgusted at the treatment of my da by tesco yorkgate. My da is 72 and has suffered from alzheimers for a number of years. We live less than 100 yards from the store and my ma and da would be in the shop everyday  however they were stopped by security today and informed that my da wasnt allowed in and was barred for 3 months.  Every morning he would take a walk for 5-10 mins  usually to yorkgate and back up  apparently this morning he went into the shop picked up a paper and tried to walk out before being stopped  due to his illness he would a been unaware what he was doing and removed from the store.  When they were stopped and informed of the ban my mum explained his condition to the security guard who got the manager   again they were informed of my das illness and that he would a been unware but the manager didnt care he said that he was barred. This flies in the face of the other staff especially in their post office part who have been brillant with my da  if he gets to the counter and its clear he is on his own they would ring our house and keep him there till we get there.  You would think they would use common sense  but not in this case. Instead they would rather stop and embarrass two pensioners. Customer services are a joke they asked me to speak to the manager and explain the situation despite me telling them the manager was informed but didnt seem to care .  Id be better speaking to the wall.",

My young son was unfortunately sick in store and both ladies were so kind and helpful that they made a very stressed mummy feel at ease and calm.  They arranged to choose some replacement clothing whilst I stripped and cleaned my son up.   They brought water and replaced my trolley and some shopping which he was unfortunately sick over.  They also gave him a lovely gift once we were all cleaned up and ready to leave.  Unfortunately I didn t get their names but on checking the box from the Toy they gave him noticed one of them had written Katie on it.  If you could find out who they were and pass on my heartfelt thanks I would be most grateful.  They were indeed a credit to customer service at Tesco.  Kind Regards   Caroline Reynolds & Theo",

I have a very poorly one year old and a very active 3 year old and needed to get to Tesco to collect medication and do a quick food shop! I go to my local Tesco in Twickenham to find that the car park is FULL of cars that do not belong to Tesco customers but to people that have gone to watch the rugby! Cars where parked on path ways  in front of trolley parks and to top it off not one car in the parent and child spaces had car seats in them....meaning they had no children with them! When I approached a member of staff he laughed at me  and asked me what I wanted him to do?!?!? While continuing to eat his pringles!!! It took me 25 mins just to get out the car park and get on my way to the next Tesco.   I then go to Tesco in Osterley....car park pretty busy...disabled bays and parent and child spaces filled with dumped trolleys! I finally find a space and do my shopping..... At the check out the young lady serving me did not offer any help...gave me only 3 bags for a full weeks worth of shopping  and kept shouting to other members of staff to ask when her break was! She scanned my shopping so fast and was asking about her break so much she ignored the fact I was asking for more bags and that my shopping was piling up with no where for me to put it! To make things even worse I get home and find that she didn t even scan my coupons and that I had been charged in full for everything!  What an awful service and truly stressful experience! Looks like I ll be going to Sainsbury s from now one!!!! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1>",

Tosay my son suffered a bad nose bleed (he is prone to them)  while in Tesco. I approached the counter that makes fresh pizza for some tissue. The woman behind it got some blue tissue straight away and asked if we needed a first aider to help. I told her no we would be fine  she then said if we felt we needed it at any point just to ask. We where then approached by a male worker (I think from the same counter or a nearby one) who told me he was a retired paramedic  and could he take a look. He was very friendly and joked with my son. He stayed with us untilbthe bleeding stopped.  Both members of staff were polite  helpful and couldn t do enough for us.   Thank you tesco",

    "post_message": "In grabbing some shopping at Tesco Brockworth  have my two kids with me  5 & 7  it was 530. Decided to visit In store cafe  after all it was DINNERTIME and we were hungry. I was informed  along with the lovely old lady in front of me  that that stop serving hot food  ie pretty much their menu at 5pm so they can get tidied down so they can leave at six.  Ultimately we all left bemused why a cafe would stop serving at a prime time of day  little pee d off because the guy on the counter was pretty unfriendly and more concerned he could get out the door on time and more than anything HUNGRY.  I can not understand why A) Tesco Cafe would want to lose trade  and money in the till? B)  other cafes in Tesco s stay open till 7 and serve until 6.45  I know this as my wife s grandmother works in one.  C)  bother displaying opening times as they in effect close at 5 not 6pm as stated? D) think is acceptable to offer people who want a hot cooked meal  a cake or crisps as a substitute?  I like Tesco  we shop there regularly  its local and selection of products of goods is great. But this Cafe takes the biscuit  which ironically is pretty much what you can get in there at dinnertime.",

I choose to shop with Tesco and collect points on my ClubCard the thought that I being rewarded makes the shopping trip less hard.  This year Ive save up all my vouchers and then  when I had a nice amount to spend I decided to treat my little daughter to a snazzy little friend.   I ordered her a BeatBot Belle and we chose to collect in store because were busy girls and did not want to miss her arriving at our door.  The text came through to say that BeatBot Belle was waiting  please come and get her and so when we had the time to spare we drove to the store together.   When we got BeatBot Belle home  we opened her that night  it didnt take us very long to discover that something was not right   Im handy  so I took her to the kitchen to start a full investigation the batteries had leaked!  I didnt want to complain or cause frustration to my little girl (who at 15 months does not much enjoy waiting)  So I cleaned the chamber and changed the batteries with no hesitating.  BeatBot Belle sprung into life but still  there was something wrong BeatrBot Belle couldnt make it to the end of any of her songs. Now to most parents this will seem a blessing  these toys  they do go on... and you seem to spend your whole life humming along to their song   and you wonder with all the new tunes that get lodged inside you head  what information are you losing to make space for them instead?!  But thats not the point  I really couldnt let this baby of mine  have a counting toy that gives up once it gets to number 9; It seems that battery acid has probably been the downfall of this toy   and so I took to twitter and spoke to a friendly  helpful boy  who said he would order a replacement that would be delivered the next day  between 7am and 7pm and theyd take the old BeatBot Belle away.  A 12 hour window is not ideal when youre two girls who like to get out and play but I made provisions to keep a 15 month old entertained at home for one whole day. Imagine the disappointment at 7:30pm when it became quite clear  that on that day a delivery was not taking place here.   Again took to twitter looking for someone to shed some light  that is when I saw there had been a problem  there was a problem with order placed last night.An insincere  apologies you were not informed I was told - Clearly this lady has not spend a day with a cabin-fevered 15 month old!

And that no real apology was offered for our wasted time and so thats the real reason of this (not to little rhyme).  I asked 3 times for an official place where I could formally complain   each time the ladies answer to me was always just the same  that she will feed my comments back  I said I wanted to do it personally but 3 times she failed to provide those contact details for me.

    "post_message": "Long story short don t bother with Tesco home delivery service. Only been using them for a month and have had three time slots missed  each time being due to Tesco vans breaking down  (which makes me come to the conclusion that they don t maintain them very well). Tesco send text messages notifications of new arrangements  but with no contact information to talk to anyone. I again make another assumption that this is because they don t want people to ring up and tell them that this is unsatisfactory or inconvenient.   On talking with the customer service department the only option is to either wait for the new time slot that Tesco have chosen or to cancel. They have no capacity to make any amendments on the day that suit us the customer but they can make amendments which suit them. I am not allow to go to store and collect the items  I can t have it rearranged for another slot of my choosing today because that might potential mean that other people might also cancel. Yet the only option that I am getting is to cancel my order for today  because Tesco computer system won t allow for such changes. In other words the computer says no!!!!!    I have chosen home delivery because I have a 6 week old baby and it can be difficult to get to store.   Your customer service is appalling. If you re going to mess with customers plans you need to either  A) have vans that don t keep breaking down  or have some spare to account for break downs. B) allow customers to change to another time slot on the same day that suits them or C) allow people to go and collect it from store instead. Just saying cancelling is a rubbish option which doesn t help your customers.   Overall my 12 month ordering subscription will be cancelled.",

My so has contacted the store manager on several occasions to no avail. He has suggested applying for a new position using the store managers if code. All in all the experience has been poor  at least one other young adult who passed the course in September has not started work  my son now risks sanctions from his benefit  though he has done nothing wrong  he has done everything asked of him.

Unfortunately nothing turned up  after calling at 6.30pm we was told the van had had an accident and we may have to re-book for 6-7pm today  but there was still a possibility that we may get our shopping.  We waited till 9.30pm and called again as time was getting on.  Spoke to a woman who put us on hold to call the store to see if it was coming.  We was told she spoke to the store manager who confirmed they are out on delivery and are definitely coming tonight but with no ETA. 11.30pm came and we gave up and went to bed as I have to be up at 4.30am for work.  We gathered it was re-booked for today at 6-7pm.  Today I was talking to a friend who lives up the road from me  literally 30 seconds drive. He received his tesco shopping yesterday just after 7pm.  So today nothing turned up again.  7.20pm my partner called up to find out where our shopping was. She was told the payment hasn t gone through  after my partner explained you took the money and its gone from our account she was told you take the money but only to refund it which takes 3-5 working days  then you try take it again the next morning. During this process you attempted to take payment 4 times this morning.  When I got home I called up and spoke to someone about the situation who was extremely helpful. He done all he could but unfortunately there was not much he could do without taking more money. Which I have to go to the bank to put in and at 8.15pm isn t possible. He gave me £25 compensation which will also take 3-5 days.  I understand accidents happen  but its how a company as large as yourselves deals with the situation. It happened to me about a year ago with asda  the store manager personally drove her own car to deliver my shopping.  Why do you have a van up the road at 7pm and another down the other end (if it arrived) who plans your routes ? Why refund something and try to retake a matter of hours later but not attempting once but four times.  Your service has been appalling.",

    "post_message": "Tesco   It takes a lot for me to complain about something. Apart from the time a wild Pikachu appeared on Pokémon go and quickly evaded me  I really can t remember the last time I was stirred from anything other than a placid temperament  but today I am quite angry.  I m a regular shopper in your express store in Kensal Rise  London  almost daily in fact.  At the weekend I was in there with a couple of friends on the way home from the fireworks. I d stopped to buy tonic water.  After paying I was waiting near the exit  with my friends  for the last of them to finish up at the tills. The security guard approached us and said to me in no uncertain terms that I had NOT paid for my shopping. I was surprised as I d heard the machine beep when I paid with my contactless card. I don t mean to brag but I m no beginner at this paying thing  especially in your Kensal Rise shop. Hell I can even tell you which self service tills are your best option. Till 1 is a good work horse  as is 5 for that matter. 2&3 seem to dance some form of infuriating tango of only being able to accept card payments  and till number 4 normally behaves but sometimes only takes coin  you know  if you re ever in there.  I m digressing. The security guard was insistent I hadn t paid and escorted me back to the tills. Starting to feel a little embarrassed I asked if he was sure I wouldn t be charged twice. Again  he very publicly insisted I hadn t paid. So  with the eyes of the shop on me  I foolishly took out the tonic water from my bag and paid once again.  I asked a final time if the security guard was sure I wouldn t be charged twice  and even more rudely this time  he told me I hadn t been charged once yet.  So  you can imagine my surprise this morning when I checked my online banking to see I have been charged TWICE.  I m not too miffed about the double charging of the 63p slimline tonic water  I ll make my financiers aware of the slip up and we ll power through. I am very displeased at the approach of your staff in the Kensal Rise store though. I was made to feel like a bit of a mug last weekend which I thought was a bit unprofessional at the time. Still  I could have made a mistake with the machines and walked away without paying by accident. Now that it turns out I had done nothing wrong  I feel that your staff should have double checked the records to see if I had paid rather than just accusing me straight off the bat and marching me back to the tills. Surely the self service machines have those capabilities?   Overall  I am unimpressed and thought you ought to know.  Steph",

I hadn t placed an order and when it was being unpacked my mum realised as she saw the name on the order and the address. So she told the driver and they packed it back up to take to the correct address. However during the time it was unpacked my little boy saw a Thomas the Tank Engine Magazine and a toy train attached to it and was beside himself when he realised it wasn t his and was going back. Later that evening when we were having dinner and myself and my husband were back  we had a knock at the door... it was the delivery driver from earlier who had bought my little boy another Thomas magazine!  It s not often someone would do something like that nowadays and I just thought he should be recognised for his kindness and thoughtfulness!!

We re enjoying a couple of days in Canterbury and  you know  tight budget  we decided to visit your store to get a sandwich and a drink. We found the refridgerator and took some fruit juice (£1.19) and a sandwich (£2.20). Together £3.39 and the £3 Meal Deal brings that down to  well  £3. Sounds nice! We went to pay and there - surprise: £6.93 (2 Meal Deals). Uhm... but wasn t it supposed to be £6? The gentleman at the cash desk explained:  That price applies to a complete meal package and yours is not complete. It is a drink + sandwich + snack. You have to choose something more  like a chocolate bar or a bag of crisps.  You must be kidding me? Is this how Tesco promotes healthy eating habits?  Frankly speaking I also don t know how that makes sense   the employee added.  So we took some chocolate bars which we didn t need and which we don t plan to eat soon  but the price went down to £6.  There s so much going on about healthy eating habits  your fellow Englishman Jamie Oliver is a warrior at this area  increasing concerns about obesitas  discussions about sugar tax... and what are you doing? We were happy to spend £6 on 2 juices and 2 sandwiches but had to take chocolate bars as well or pay more.  Please be ashamed of yourselves  go back to school  do your homework again and correct this error (because I want to believe it s something you all just overlooked rather than producers of chocolate bars and crisps bribing you guys to force their products onto consumers).  I hope you (and other readers) will understand I m not crying about £0.93 price difference here...",

Their kindness had me in tears. I had a home delivery and there was an exchange on some ice cream  my son needs to eat the free from range and without really checking my husband accepted the exchange. however  the exchange ice creams have hazelnuts in which our son is severely allergic to. He is anaphylactic to them and stops breathing which  is as you can only imagine quite difficult so we don t have any nut products in the house. I decided to try and take them back to our local store in Gosport and knowing that the delivery didn t come from them I went up to the counter and explain the situation. Karena and Danny said the situation could be sorted and they would never want to see a little boy sad in the morning  this store doesn t even stock the free from ice creams i was returning!!!  they stop the ones that my son can eat. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0081><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0081><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0081><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0081>These two people s kindness is beyond special for a Mummy that find buying food so so difficult for a little boy that just wants to be as normal as possible and eating ice cream <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+00A6><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+00A6><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+00A6><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+00A6><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+00A6><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+00A6> is one of the things little boys do.

When packing my shopping into my bag I noticed some sherbet which I brought had split  obviously I didn t notice when I picked it up! It had gone over everything in my handbag as I put it in  I wasn t happy so I moaned a bit  didn t get an apology at all. I asked Matt if he would get me another one  he rudely said go and get it yourself  to which I replied  I beg your pardon   i asked again  I was trying to empty my bag of sherbet  I said that s the least you can do considering you put it on the shelf split  he said we didn t put it on the shelf split!! I appreciate it might not of been noticed  but a little help and understanding would of been appreciated. Then I asked to see the manager  no manager in store I was told! Matts colleague then appeared and sniggered behind the till  I caught them both laughing when I came back. I have never been treated with such disrespect  Matt has attitude  I heard the way he spoke to other customers  and your other member of staff turned up at the till just to laugh. It s funny that I have sherbet all over the contents of my handbag is it? I am appalled by your customer service  do you not train your staff??",

    "post_message": "Help reduce plastic pollution in UK rivers and seas by asking retailers to switch own-brand cotton bud stems from plastic to paper.  Why is this important?  Plastic cotton bud stems are the number one item of plastic  sewage-related debris on our beaches and rivers [1] - yet retailers could help prevent this by switching the stick from plastic to paper.  In the marine environment  plastics can be eaten by marine life  often with fatal consequences. Plastic is found in the stomachs of Loggerhead Turtles  Seabirds and many species of UK-caught fish. And pieces that don t get eaten break down into microplastics  forming part of a dangerous plastic smog in our seas.  Retailers are listening - earlier this year  Waitrose and Johnson & Johnson announced they d make the change to paper  and the Coop and Marks and Spencers sell paper-stem buds. Now we need to make sure the others do the same.  Tesco  Sainsburys  Boots  ASDA  Morrisons  Lidl  Aldi  Superdrug and Wilko are currently reviewing their policies on cotton buds ... which is why we need to show them how many of us support the switch to paper!  Even paper stem cotton buds shouldnt be flushed down the loo. But if they are  they re less likely to pass through sewage filters and will quickly biodegrade if they escape",

I just Hate having to go and ask one of the till staff the price of things as the shelf price was unclear . Today it was a notebook   on the shelf it said £1    i thought it was wrong so i had to ask   the price was £4 . Just a bit of difference maybe but for a pensioner it may be the difference between being able to pay for my goods at the til or not and then holding everyone up . Sorry to complain but in future if things are unclear i will buy them elsewhere where the prices are clearly marked . I was always told that the price on the shelf is what you pay   not in your case .",

Cue one inconsolable child and frustrated mum.  I asked at Customer Services and was told it only gets filled  as and when .

Went to Pharmacy to collect my repeat prescription that was sent electronically to them from my GP on 25th October. Was asked to come back for it and they would have it ready. There were 5 staff behind the counter  but they claimed they were short of staff and thats why it wasnt ready. Oh and by the way  I know its important to stock the shelves  but to ignore people waiting then stop the stock up to speak to a staff member that comes to the counter?

    "post_message": "Yesterday we were disappointed to receive a letter from Highview Parking on behalf of Tesco telling us we would be charged £70 (£40 if we pay early) for using their carpark at Silverburn for over 3 hours. I was totally unaware of any time limits and assumed  as many would  that this carpark is free like the rest of Silverburns parking. I understand that you do this to deter people using the shopping centre and not going into your store but when we do use it for our Tesco shop aswell  it s a kick in the teeth. On many occasions we park here to go to the shopping centre/cinema and then into Tesco to do our weekly shop. Do you suggest we park further down  have a wander around the shops  go back to the car  then drive up to the top of the carpark where I suppose we must cross the threshold into the  Tesco carpark  to go and do our shop. In this letter it was stated that we had infact gone over the time limit before but were let off. Might I suggest that you ask the company you employ to manage your carpark  to send out a letter the first time informing your customers of their indiscretion and be careful to not let it happen a second time to avoid a fine. You can be assured that we will no longer be using Tesco for our weekly shop. My husband and I have informed our family  friends and colleagues whom we know use Silverburn and Tesco and not one of them knew about this time limit and have told us that they will no longer shop with Tesco. We are really disappointed and feel this a cheap way for you to make money off your customers.",

    "post_message": "Hiya  on the 7th November 2016 me  my mum and my 10 month old son went shopping at Tesco in Burnley on Centenary Way. We decided to use the handheld scanners and went around scanning all our shopping as we do normally. Everything was fine. We went to the check out with our shopping at roughly 9:15pm. At the check out I was served first for a few bits I d got while my mum queued behind me. A cashier then called my mum over to the next till as there was a large queue behind her. My mum went over to the cashier and I bought my shopping placed it upon the pram and then went over to my mum. As I got there the cashier serving my mum had taken the scanner and then performed  the random check that came up. The cashier then went back to the till and told us the total to pay is£15 something. After being told this my mum replied that the total was not right it should be more. The woman then said very promptly that we hadn t scanned the milk for starters. I told her that I had and there must be some mistake. She then told us we hadn t scanned quite a few of the items (which I knew we had) and was ordered to put all our shopping on the check out. She went through all the items that came up on her display and put them to the side. There were quite a few items that hadn t come up on her display. The cashier then asked Again if we had scanned the items on the handheld scanner in I dubious demeanour  to which I responded that i had checked the scanner myself just before coming to the check out with my mum. She proceeded to call a security guard (1) over. She told him that we hadn t scanned a lot of items through and he questioned me on whether I had in fact actually scanned these so called unscanned items (as I usually use the scanners for my mum with her being a lady of a certain age)  to which I replied that I did. I had checked  the whole list on the display of the scanner after finishing our shopping before proceeding to the check out. I then told them that i could remember the total and it should be £36.70 something. More Tesco workers crowded round us watching what was happening along other shoppers like some sort of big event was happening. This made me and my mum feel extremely  intimated  uncomfortable and embarrassed  worse was us having my 10 month old son asleep with us in his pram. One of the Tesco staff members who came to spectate (after the security guards was summoned) then pointed to my son s pram and said she got all these on her pram. To which I told her I had bought them separately just before my mum and I had the receipt for. She then went quiet and stood next to the cashier and continued to spectate. The security guard (1) then called for another security guard (2) to come talk to us which then made us worried futher. In the meantime the cashier at the check out was turning other customers away saying she had a problem with us  so they were all staring as we had security guards and tesco staff around us. The security guard (2) came and spoke with the cashier. She told him we hadn t scanned the items through in a way that made it sound as though i had done this deliberately to avoid payment for some  of our items  despite the fact of my mum telling the cashier that the total was wrong in the first place and they must be an error when told the shopping came to £15 something. The cashier said I hadn t scanned half the items because they are not showing on her display. The security guard  (2) then asked me if I scanned the items to which again I said that I had and that shopping should total £36.70 something as shown on the scanner before we gave it the cashier. The cashier then inturpted us to asked the security guard (2) if she should proceed to void the sale and let them deal with us to which the security guard (2) then ask her to scan all the items before they  dealed with us  to see what the amount of the shopping totaled to see if what we had said the handheld scanner total had said and unsurprisingly to us when she did this (which she should of done in the first place)  the total of the items came to £36.72. She then asked the security guard (2) what she should do. The security guard (2) said then to the cashier  that it s fine  turned to us for a split second and said the words I m sorry (nothing else) before promptly walking away. The rest of the staff who was watching us like a major event was going on just then all went away. The cashier then apologised to JUST my mum and said she d never known the scanning system to do this before and then finally allowed to purchase our items. We was stopped at your tills for 15-20 minutes whilst this was resolved which led to my mum missing her bus home leaving us with no option to sit on the bench at the end of the check outs where my mum was almost in tears until other travel arrangements was arranged. Not really what I expect when I go to do my shopping with yourselves  and i think it s appalling customer service. For me to have to be made to feel that way with my baby was bad  but my mum is 62 years of age  that is disgraceful........ please feel free to review your cctv where you will see me clearly scanning all items for both me and my mum.",

My son who is 3 was having a bit of a meltdown he was tired  fed up and excited for the party. He was in the trolley having a cry while I was trying to  scan my items through the self serve as fast as possible so we could get out before irritating all the other shoppers. One of your sales assistants called James came over and tried to talk to my son  then he disappeared round the tills and came back with a store catalogue filled with toys and stickers to stick on the toys you like. He instantly stopped crying settled down and was engrossed in the pictures of superheroes that James had found. This in itself was great customer service  but James didn t stop there. He asked what fruit Noah liked and ran off to fetch him a banana and told us about their fresh fruit for kids policy. I haven t experienced customer service like this ever before. He is a credit to Tesco and I hope you will thank him again for me  he definitely deserves some kind of recognition.  (This was about 2:40pm Monday 31st oct.)",

    "post_message": "A bit of feedback on Tesco s freefrom range...i m allergic to all dairy and always look out for some dairy free treats in the freefrom section.  At the first glance I get excited seeing cakes and sweet snacks which I ve never been able to eat. But then I get really disappointed when it soley says gluten free and wheat free on the packaging and find that its not actually dairy free.  I m sure alot of other people feel like this. To be honest I shop more in Sainsburys and Asda for freefrom products because I feel like they actually have products which are both gluten and dairy free. That way no one is dissappointed.  I think Tesco need to do this too! You need make your freefrom products completely free from gluten and dairy. You ll appeal to more people that way. This goes for your Tesco finest gluten free range too  it would be nice if they were dairy free. Let me know what you think of my feedback. Thanks  Anisha",

    "post_message": "On Nov the 6th the gf fairy awoke from a deep sleep  and looked outside and thought what a cold winter s day. I know  she thought Ill warm my tum with a fine gf spiced pear pie. So off she flew in the cold  cold wind across Tescoland to the extra store in Corstorphine. Yes  boxes in plenty were stacked on the shelf. The fairy was happy with the thought of a full tum.   But no! shouted the fairy  the first box was a week out of date. Never mind thought the fairy  boxes were still on the shelf. She tried another one  and another. On and on the fairy laboured but all of the boxes were well out of date. The fairy was feeling weaker and weaker  she needed food to fill her small tum. Oh thought the fairy  I know what Ill do. A nice toasted gf bagel will suit just as well. She turned to the shelf  but alas and alack that shelf was as empty as her poor rumbling tum. Getting weaker and weaker she had a last thought  a gf chocolate muffin could do the trick. With tears in her eyes she reached for the shelf  but not one gf muffin was in sight..No gf muffins  no gf bagels and only pear pies that were out of date.   The tears started running  what would she do now. And then through the hunger a dim light arose. Back across Tescoland she would go. So to the Broughton Tesco she flew  her wings flapping slower and slower.   Yes there were the gf pear pies all lined up on the shelf. She felt stronger and stronger at the thought of the warm spicy pears in her tum. But no  surely it couldnt happen twice in one day. The first packet was out of date by two days  and the next and the next and the next more than week out of date. Surely there must be a packet to be had that was still in date.   Oh goodness what could she do know  her energy was low and the thought of trying a third Tesco Leith seemed too much to bear but then as her thoughts started to turn to the closest rival store she reached up on her very tiptoes and right at the back behind all of the boxes  she found just one box with at least one day left on its date. She took the box and flew from the store  home  home she thought and warmed up the pie almost as rare as gold dust.    As she ate it she thought  please  please Tescoland  I may be gf but I get as hungry as everyone else  please keep your stocks up to date or one day all the gf fairies will shop elsewhere for their favourite free from food.",

There was no Money  Travel  Home or other sections.  I rang the store  and the very abrupt  snotty assistant manager said very tersely there were signs in the store to say there were sections of the paper missing.  Well  not on top of the pile of Times there wasn t!  She said they had been left in the rain by Menzies  were soaking wet  and they were waiting for more to come in.  Well  my knowledge of Menzies tells me that no way will they deliver replacements on a Sunday!  She said to pop back later and I could pick them up  but could give no indication as to when (as I said - pigs might fly if they arrive).  She couldn t get me off the phone quick enough  was downright rude  and I have made a formal complaint about her unacceptable attitude.  BUT surely in a situation like this incomplete newspapers should not be put on sale at the full price?  She told Customer Services when I complained to them it was the supplements that were missing  but she is lying.  The supplements were there  wrapped in polythene  it was half of the main paper that was missing.  This is blatantly dishonest to let customers buy half a product at the full price when you know the paper is massively incomplete.  What is Tesco s policy on this sort of thing?  Fleece the customer?  I am still seething at the member of staff s attitude  and even more disgusted that she called herself Assistant Manager.",

Yesterday I collected my order from your Tesco store Gunton  Lowestoft.  Four items from my order were missing.

This is not the first time this has happened and I have actually lost count of the times I have had things missing.  I now have to find time to back and get the missing items which is costing me time and petrol money as I live 3 miles away.  Why can t Tesco just put the missing items in one of their delivery trucks and get the driver to drop it off?  It s their incompetence and they should put it right.  I have two young children which don t particularly want to be dragged around a busy supermarket on a weekend which is why I done click and collect in the first place.  I am feeling very disheartened that this keeps happening and am wondering why I use Tesco when they can t get an order right.  I know people make mistakes however as I mentioned before this is not the first time.

Please consider putting a syringe in the box already instead of a spoon or offering them to parents to make our lives a little easier when our little ones are poorly because as you say  every little helps  !",

    "post_message": "Hmmm...Interesting to see that the four packs of biscuits (EAN: 5010204464190 I bought from my local store this evening were each found to be one biscuit short when compared with two previously purchased packs that were already in my kitchen cupboard. The newer packs are clearly 6mm shorter in length  and thus at least one biscuit fewer.  Neither EAN  given pack weight  nor price has been adjusted to take this adjustment into account.      A quick calculation (Based on the count of 12 packs in an SRP box) shows that this gives Tesco just under one extra packet out of every two such boxes  or roughly one extra SRP box per pallet.  This also scales up negatively for the customer  who will inevitably wind up having to purchase an extra SRP box (At extra cost) to obtain the same quantity of product. As someone who consumes these at the rate of about two packets every three days  this extra volume in purchase will be encountered pretty darn sharpish. :-/      You didn t really expect customers not to notice this  did you? I hate to use a cliche  but this REALLY takes the biscuit! :-o :-p",

    "post_message": "High praise for Manchester Gorton Extra (Hyde Road) store:   We found ourselves in Manchester late last night (around 11.30pm/midnight) without any cash or cards and in need of petrol to get home to Lincolnshire.  We called in to Tesco for petrol thinking we could use contactless payment via our phone but this was not the case  nor could we get cashback from the store using our phone.  Despite 3 or 4 members of staff  suggesting different ways of trying to help us out of our predicament  it seemed like there was not solution so we left the store (grateful for their help  but worried as to how to get home).  We were nearly at our car when the lady working on the security desk (sorry we didn t get your name) came running across the car park with another solution which we tried & it worked :-)    That the staff were so helpful initially was lovely  but the fact that the security lady carried on thinking of a solution and took the time and trouble to leave the store and fetch us to try it (when it would have been very easy just to let us go and try to figure it out on our own) was  to me  above and beyond.  I really wish we d thought to ask for your name so that I could mention it here - I do hope this message & our thanks finds its way to you (and your manager).  Keep up the great work!

Just as we walked out the door the customer service team rang back and said the driver is on your road and you next drop. After agreeing this would be acceptable and we would wait. Another 25mins passed and still no shopping we decided at this point we would not wait any longer and rung back and said please move to tomorrow. We was told that we would be charged for today s shop and tomorrow and then have to wait 3 working days for a refund. (Why should we be out of pocket for your error) I work within customer service and all that was needed was a call/text saying we are sorry but we can t make the agreed time and agree another time.

    "post_message": "I ve been a customer at your Brooklands store for years. But yesterday I felt like I was an inconvenience to your staff. I had a query about my receipt so I went to the customer service desk. The customer service desk is right next to the tobacco counter. 2 people were serving on it after 15 mins of waiting and my 4 year old son was having a meltdown not once was I acknowledged. In the end my husband went over and grabbed a member of staff (checkout supervisor I think) who came over and got one of the staff who were serving to see me (one of the 2 that ignored me whilst on tobacco counter) . The young lad that saw me was in such a fluster  although he gave me a refund it seemed he wasn t really taking any notice of my complaint and just wanted to get it over and done with. After years of working in retail myself  I find this shocking customer service - especially as its a designated customer service desk. If my son wasn t in such a state I would ve taken this up with the store general manager. Could you please pass this on to him/her please. Many thanks.",

After arriving home  we tucked in to the toffee apples and to my utter horror and disgust a big fat caterpillar crawled out of the toffee apple that I  yes I  was enjoying  grabbed hold of me and dragged me inside the toffee apple.  Now I wouldn t have minded if the caterpillar had asked me first  would you like to adventure inside my toffee apple home dear sir?  But no  the detestable little oik just yanked me in with not a care to be had.  Now as you may know apples are quite dense and hard inside unlike a peach (that James was a lucky tike) and I suffered some bruising  now that wasn t the worst of it sir  oh no!  After he viscously pulled me in he took me to where I figure must have been the controls to fly his toffee apple craft and I was amazed to find that he had been shopping at asda (go figure right?) So I confronted him about this and he answered with  well  I do like an asda apple crumble  the cheek!!!! Anyway he flew me round for a bit  then dropped me back off at home  anyway my point is  why was this allowed to happen and why weren t the toffee apples checked before being put out of the stock room?  I am not only outraged but rather puzzled. Can you explain yourselves to me please?  Cheers.",

I could understand her asking if my brother had been touching the bottles  carrying them or saying clearly which one he wanted. He did not  he just came along to get some food which we would get after the alcohol. I told her  it was not a company rule - but something a colleague would decide  both my friend and I work for another supermarket and know that if we were to treat a customer in such fashion  action against us would have been taken swiftly and we would have been punished. She called a manager over and I explained to him the situation - HE UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY  he did not have any reason to believe that I was buying it for my underage brother so he checked our ID s and approved it. The girl who had previously refused me  went to her other two colleagues - all three of which stood  giving us filthy looks and outright staring to the point where I had to tell the female manager there that they were making me very uncomfortable and could she please ask them to stop. This kind of behaviour is disgusting  not only to cause trouble in asking for ID  but to then purposefully attempt to make a customer feel distressed and uncomfortable. Absolutely disgraceful. I WILL be telling friends and family of the encounter  as well as anyone else who speaks of Tesco in a good light and I will not be coming back to your store (neither will my family) for such actions.  Unneeded!  (Friday the 4th  between 10 and 10.35  Tesco off Ipswich Road.)",

We had no intention of looking at the fish counter but it caught my 10 year old son s eye and George came over and showed my son the detail of each fish  the teeth  scales etc and even gave him gloves to hold each fish. The end result was my son having the enthusiasm to choose his own fish to bring home to eat.  George even wanted my son to let him know if he likes it. I know it was quiet but the time he put aside for my son was really appreciated and to see him excited about fish was great. Getting kids to eat anything healthy nowadays is so hard so thank you George!  Please pass on my comments and maybe reward him for great service as this should be encouraged. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+00A1> <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008F>",

But with the stand you took against unilever and with the promise of your  brand guarantee   I decided to give you another go. Imagine my disgust when I was charged 1.89 and 2.00 for 2 items that I could have bought from asda for 1.50 each. When I queried this in store   it was explained to me that you actually compare ALL branded items and even it out. So overall my basket of shopping was 2.20 cheaper than other supermarkets  but you don t tell me which products are cheaper and I m still charged the higher amount for 2 of the products I know for a fact are cheaper elsewhere. Our basket of shopping came to a grand total of £155.77. It s not pocket change  that s a lot of money. So a measly 0.89 pence has cost you 2 customers who used to spend in excess of £600 per month on groceries and another £160 per month in petrol.

I am so tired of my 5yo daughter having to wear boys super hero items that look like boys clothes. After all  you can get plenty for Women! Its very sexist to still believe that girls should like only girly things. Black Widow is a girl. Supergirl is a girl. But even the males superheros are just as important and don t need to be glittered or changed to pink logo s. Just a nice girls fitted shirt  or pjs would be a start.Superheroes clothes that look like they are for girls! My girl needs to dress like she wants! She is a big superhero fan and I know she is not alone!! She doesn t want any more fancy dress dresses  she has supergirl outfit hanging up with her elsa dress. She wants Tee s...Hoodies  Pjs!!

Our Tesco delivery arrived yesterday evening and 1 of the 3 chickens had 5th Nov as an expiry date  whilst the others had 10th. This was too short a shelf life and I handed it back saying it was a shame as I was planning to cook all 3 of them at once on Sunday.   Charlie was the delivery chap and unprompted he offered to come back at the end of his delivery rounds and drop an additional chicken. We said that would be great if it was possible.   Low and behold there was a knock on the door at around 21:30 which was Charlie back with an additional chicken (and also a pack of pancetta as I hadn t wanted the substitute available).   Absolutely amazing  well done Charlie and well done Tesco!",

    "post_message": "Hi   So on Tuesday  I visited your Sunderland store with my family  as it is my local and we do all of our shopping there. Now we ve never had any problems before but one of your staff members was rude and extremely unhelpful to us. My 3 year old son loves Disney s Lion Guard  so whenever we visit and he s been good  we treat him to the little figures that you sell. He was particularly good on Tuesday so we were treating him to 2. He was excited to find that it was the new range of figures and couldn t wait to open them when we got home. We went through self checkout as usual and the figures wouldn t scan. So we contacted a member of staff  who then proceeded to tell us that they weren t on the system. He then wandered off and came back a moment later and said we can t sell you them and then took them from us and walked away! Not trying to resolve the issue as your  Missions  say on your page. My little boy then thought it was his fault and got upset  we then had a tantrum on the way home. All of this because your staff member couldn t be bothered to help. I m more disappointed for him but the lack of interest annoyed me because usually the service is great. Regards  Mark",

Every day for the last few months shortly after 6pm the Manager at the store blocks off the rear entrance/exit with a large bin that is normally sited outside the building. He does this so that he can start stacking the store trolleys inside the porch just immediately outside the door.  This is particularly annoying  because as a shopper I now have to take a bit of a circuitous route to get in the store through a till that is actually open (either that or open the closed till security gates and set off the alarm as the till at the end of the store where he blocks the entrance are almost always closed).  Id be very surprised if it doesnt also break a few Health & Safety regulations  which is why Ive also reported this matter to Broxbourne Council.  I thought part of the reason for having a store manager is to ensure a good service is provided to the customer.",

My eldest boy came out of school  with a piece of Velcro in his hand  it was the top strap of his Tesco school shoes bought for him only 8 weeks ago. Now  I know my boy wears his shoes hard  they don t last on him  that s why I buy cheap ones!  We head over to the BR store straight from school  thinking  I can get a new pair for him to wear tomorrow  so that he doesn t break uniform rules.  Head into the store and there is ONE pair of shoe which is suitable for a school shoe. In sizes 8/9/2. No other sizes available says the customer assistant I spoke to.  There were two pairs of black trainers with decoration  which I and many other don t Class as school shoes. They would be against the uniform rules of the school and are not good for growing feet to be in all day.  So now  due to no choice or fault of his own  he has to go to school tomorrow in his casual trainers and break the rules.   I am continually disgusted by the lack of choice of boys clothes and shoes available in Tesco Stores  but this really takes the mickey!   Regards   Disappointed in Bognor Regis.",

I proceeded to the ready meals aisle where there is a 5ft tall poster advertising this promotion and chose my main  side  dessert and drink from the Finest products on the shelves.  However  when I went through the checkout the promotion was not applied so I went to customer services to query it.  The member of staff at Customer Services duly went off to take a look at the shelves and returned to tell me she d spoken to a manager and Tesco are no longer running the meal deal promotion.  So I queried why the poster is still up if the promotion is unavailable and was somewhat bemused (and irritated) to be told that it was okay to still have the poster up because the POS stand had been removed therefore making it clear that the promotion was over!  Erm  no  sorry  there s a life size poster next to the shelf displaying the Finest Ready Meal products  not to mention the small stickers next to the wine and beer on these shelves.  So customers are supposed to see the poster and ignore it then! Makes perfect sense!",

I emplour you to rethink this item and how it would affect the millions of mums or adults who have them to be out shopping and come face to face with this  I would also request whoever it is that chose to stock this to sit down and watch a video no doubt there are are some out there and see how heartbreaking it is to watch a serious meltdown and not feel ashamed of themselves for this idiotic item on sale in a store that has supported charities of those with autism aspergers and many other special needs in the past  rise above your competitor and don t brush it of as a joke  it is not funny  regards and merry christmas",

    "post_message": "So Tescos you are adding to my already time consumed busy working mum life. Christmas is now approaching and I want to get my son the Amazon fire kids edition with blue case. I see you currently have a great offer on and I also have clubcard vouchers I would like to use towards the purchase. All sounds simple so far doesn t it?  Well I see you are out of stock on Tesco Direct so I promptly add a stock alert to the item (not that I am now convinced I will get one). I also thought to check my local stores for stock online. Pitsea shows low stock so I race over to find they only have pink fair enough. Whilst I was awaiting for a member of your customer service staff to tell me this I enquired with another colleague there that I could redeem my points off my clubcard. She said no instore they need to be printed. I don t receive vouchers as I only moved house a year ago which I thought after a few calls to clubcard I had amended apparently not. No worries though as they have a machine at pitsea you can print off your vouchers so I just input my old address. When they said they didn t have it I thought ok won t print vouchers now then as it was late and I had a ridiculous early start for work the next day. Checking stock again I saw your Southend store had stock and thinking ahead decided to call the store in advance to be advised yes 2 blue in stock. So once I returned home from my long day in London sorted tea  bath & homework for kids I raced down before electrical desk closed at 8. On arrival I asked customer services where there voucher printing machine was to be told they don t have 1. Anyway I thought worse case scenario I would ask customer services to hold the tablet whilst I raced to pitsea & back. Get a store map to see the inconvenience this would cause me. However I thought go see for myself the tablet. Guess what happens next  you don t have any stock at Southend even when I annoyed the guy on electrical to check again. Now fuming I head to customer services as apparently the guy on electrical couldn t check the stock on his computer as it didn t recognise like probably one of the top 10 kids tablets. Even with a ticket in his hand which with my previous experience working in a supermarket I can only assume it must have a ref no on it to identify stock(just guessing it would be a useful thing to have on it?) so I go to customer services to ask why I was told your store had stock. Well without a blink of her eye she said yes you probably spoke to Cardiff. Well why in hell would I be phoning a store in Essex  to speak to someone in Cardiff? She said yes they look on a computer to see stock levels. So I said so you must have the stock then  she said no the computer isn t always right. I d like to also add at this point no one had apologised to me for all the inconvenience this had caused me. That was the reason so basically tough is what I was told. I then enquired if she could look the item up to see when stock was likely to arrive. Guess what she couldn t do that. I returned home livid  tired and again stressing on where I could possibly get this tablet you have on offer.  Well Tesco I would like to know? Your computer systems don t appear to be very helpful......kind regards Clare Louise Hall-Guy",

Your solicitor sent paperwork wich I filled im. I waited and waited for a response eventually I got a letter asking for extra time to investigate. I then got quite a patronising letter back saying we wouldn t be getting anything. They even put the cleaning log in to say the floor wasn t slippy. I found that very patronising. It took weeks for my sons head to heal and it can still be tender sometimes. I didn t post anything on social media because I wanted to give Tesco the benefit of the doubt but I m sorry I think your customers needs to know how callus you are. The main point I raised about the shelves hasn t been delt with they are still in the store and still have sharp edges. Just because my son is the only one to be hurt shouldn t mean they are ok. One accident should be more than enough.",

However  after searching in three - count  em  THREE - different stores  as well as sending my girlfriend out and about to try and find some. No luck.   I used to literally buy four pots a week  and now I am on an inflicted fasting of my favourite hummus.  If I was a fairytale character  I d be Goldilocks and your hummus would be  just right . If I were a wrestler  I d be The Rock and asking the fans   do you smell what The Rock is cooking?  And they d respond with   something to go with your hummus!     If I was Charlie Bucket given the opportunity to run Willy Wonka s chocolate factory  I d say   No ta  I m holding out hope for Tesco s caramelised onion hummus factory .  You get the picture  I really like it.   Please tell me you haven t stopped production of this fine product! I don t care if somebody accidently dropped shards of glass in the mixing pot or some fella lost his thumb in the production line - I d rather have the hummus and take the risk.   Please let me know  so I can have my mind put at ease  and know that I will once again be enjoying my favourite hummus in the near future.   Many thanks   Stefan Armitage (Clubcard Holder)  PS.

Never mind  I ll post this on my own timeline   alongside the original. At least  that way the people that mean anything to me will know how I feel about your organisation. I realise that you are busy dealing with all the pictures of Halloween masks and are only too happy to respond to people giving you a pat on the back. but I would hope that you could  at least acknowledge one of your customers  that has suffered an injury at the expense of one of your products. Yes  my post was done in a light hearted manner and was not threatening legal action in any way (perhaps I should have)  but that is no reason for it to be ignored. I estimate that between my wife and I  we spend between four and five thousand pounds per year in your stores. If you wish us to ship off to another supermarket  just say the word  there are no shortages these days. I wasn t after compensation  all I wanted was an acknowledgement and some empathy from your organisation to one of your loyal customers. If that is beyond you  I know what I need to do in the future.",

    "post_message": "Hi Tesco. I have always been a big fan but today your customer service has let you down so much that I want the world to know how appalled I am. My daughter (4 years old) had set her heart on a pair of your school shoes so I bought them for her to start the new term with. She was so happy! And so was I at £13.00 that was a big saving on school shoes :) they ticked all the boxes and most importantly were labelled scuff resistant. So after her first day of wearing them to school yesterday her heart was broken that they were  ruined  with a big scuff on them. I was not impressed but reassured her that we would get her another pair. I never for a moment doubted that there would be a problem. After speaking to Lauren at your customer service desk at Swansea she advised us she would need to speak to a manager as we did not have a receipt. Understandable but obvious the shoes had only been worn once and still looked brand new despite the scuff! Lauren s manager Paul then approached us to say they could not be replaced or damaged as it was not a fault with the shoe it was a scuff and these things happen. We agreed that yes you can expect shoes to scuff on a 4 year old however these were advertised as scuff resistant and had been worn once!!!! Paul was very condescending and would not listen to a word that me or my husband were saying refusing to exchange the shoes. I argued that Tesco pride themselves on school uniform lasting and false advertising and he reluctantly and rudely said go and exchange them then but they will still scuff! We picked a replacement pair and Paul had disappeared from sight. Lauren replaced the product for us and as she was doing so another of her colleagues Lisa leant over to us and said  I m not being funny but they will do exactly the same  again very rudely. If we had our receipt we would have had a full refund and never bought school shoes from you again. As it stands we exchanged our shoes but are not holding out hopes as to how long they will last. Absolutely shocking that you are advertising them as scuff resistant school shoes however they are obviously not fit for purpose. I will be very interested to see how many people comment with how their Tesco shoes for school have lasted their children. Your motto is every penny counts and it certainly does £13 for school shoes that lasted one day! Leaving us out of pocket and with the extra hassle of an upset 4 year old and a trip back to Tesco. With a history in customer service I am aware of exactly how a customer should be treated and can t believe just how appallingly we were treated by a manager at Tesco! Very disappointed Tesco I shall be shopping elsewhere from today onwards.",

    "post_message": "Regarding order number (message me for it)  I would like to make a serious complaint.  On Sunday I tried to make an online order to by a tv. Catalogue Number: 714-6584  I needed to order it with a note to the courier to call me 15 mins before they will arrive so i can leave my office and go home to greet them. So I called up on Sunday to see if this was possible.  On the phone  the girl told me that:  1. If I order express next day delivery  in the morning I would receive an email from a courier giving me an hours window in which I could go home and sit and wait for the tv. She checked on the catalogue number that this would be ok for this product and if it would get delivered by the courier that gives this option. 2. She could set up an account for me then and there and take my payment over the phone.  So I did the above.  I did not receive any email to confirm my account  or the invoice  or the order. This got me worried so the following morning (Monday) I called you.  The man on the phone said it was strange  confirmed my email  and just told me to sit and wait for the email invoice to come. he told me he could not resend the confirmation or invoice (which I think is weird). This was not a helpful conversation.  Later that day I called again as nothing arrived.  In this conversation I was told.  1. I should never have been told that my tv will arrive on Monday  as that is not an option - but why? (although it was an option online) 2. My email address is wrong - you forgot to include the s on amandameadows363@gmail.com. which is absolutely silly as this was confirmed in the previous phone call  AND the first phone call- your customer service advisors are not being accurate enough. 3. No one has the ability to change it (why????) and I cannot wait online for their colleague to do it - they needed to log a ticket elsewhere (which has not been done as I still have had no email) 4. The girl I spoke to was leaving and would ask her colleague to call me within 7-9pm that evening  every 30 mins until I pick up   and everything will be rectified.  I received no call.  to my knowledge i bought and paid for a tv  (a huge purchase for me)   I have no idea where it is  it should have arrived  I have no email correspondence from you  and all i am doing is wasting my money and time calling you  no one can help me or even return my calls. Do you expect me to keep calling you?  Where is my tv  when is it coming and does Tesco even care about me or my order or want me as a future customer?  To my knowledge its it could be sitting on my doorstep waiting to be stolen.  Amanda -message me for phone number",

I visited the Cleckheaton Tesco petrol pumps last night at around 8pmish after going to my usual filling station and seeing it was closed. I was trying to fill my car and realised it was a pay at pump filling point  I must confess I ve never used one before and the gent that was working with the lady came to help and show me how.  For one reason or another after 4 attempts the pump did not want to read my card. They advised me I can t pay cash as that side of it had been turned off. Then the lovely lady  offered to pay on her card amd fill my car while I ran across the car park to draw the cash out to give to her.  She was so helpful and I can t express my thanks enough. I only wish I caught her name. Please can you pass on my thanks and ensure that she is recognised at the store for her fantastic customer care.  Mrs Emma Harrison (Now a Tesco shopper)",

I put 12 items in my trolly coming to over £300  when I went to checkout it said saving of £39! So I removed 9 items & left 3  it showed no discount. I then put 3 items in the basket marked 3 for 2! The discount applied  so clearly it s false advertising as the promotion is not on ALL toys & only on selected toys. I processed my order & recieved my confirmation email saying my order is being processed. I then recieved another email saying problem with my order  refund of £20.05 is being processed! No reason why. So the most expensive item can not be processed  that s convenient. I do not want this order as there is no promotion that in benefitting from. So not only is Tesco advertising falsely  but you don t benefit from any item you do buy as there s problems with the order! Tesco I m very disappointed & feel ripped off by yourselves.
