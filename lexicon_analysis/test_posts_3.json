    "post_message": "Was really disappointed with your Port Talbot store yesterday  we had ordered a number of rolls from the bakery for a 9am collection as my mother and I were providing a buffet after my Aunties funeral. When we went to collect them they said they didn t know about the order and then changed to say they had a problem and they were being proven and would be ready in an hour and a half . We expressed that we were not happy but would return in an hour and a half. We then went to complain to customer services who said they would check what the problem was and would phone me to confirm the problem. My husband returned at the specified time to be told there was no order in the book  then they found it  and was then told they hadn t put them in the oven yet!!!! Confused??? Me too  it seems there was a catalogue of errors in the store yesterday as we had no phonecall from customer services either! We finally had our rolls which we had to then cool under fans in order to use them . Yesterday was already a stressful day without all this. I don t usually complain but I was really upset. I would like to add though in general I love shopping in your store  the staff are always friendly and helpful. Thanks",

I have had tonsillitis since last Thursday and I am on cocodamol and cannot drive due to my tablets that is the reason I ordered a delivery  now I have no food in my apartment and no way to go out and get any. Sophie from stretford tesco put her manager on the phone and he stated that he has no drivers coming to my area for the rest of the day and offered no alternative to this situation. I am now \u00a391.00 down due to your incompetence . I am now without food. What are you going to do- bearing in mind this delivery was meant to be here between 10-11. I am not happy at all.

I will then take my bill into Tesco Inverurie and show it to the Duty Mgr so they can see just how much custom they are losing in me alone. I have already emailed Tesco Customer Service to advise them of this. I suggest ANYONE can do this - there is no need to be confrontational or rude about it....just save your alternate choice grocery bill  head for Tesco afterwards  speak to the Duty Mgr & continue to do this every time you shop until they get the message. If enough people ALL OVER the UK do this it will get our point across in spades that Tesco shoppers are NOT amused and their bowing to what amounts to anti-Scotland racism will cost them millions.

It seems as though they are as attainable as a unicorn steak and not only that  your customer services team in fact know nothing about them.  This issue first arose after making a special effort to try and locate them in the London stores listed as stockists on your website.  None of the stores had them in stock which is why I contacted Customer Services.  The first person told me to check in the stores listed on your website (which was a point I had made clear in my first email) and then told me that there are supplier issues and they don t know when they ll be back in stock after telling me they are not in stock.  Another person apologised for the  rigmarole  and said that the confusion has arisen from the fact that Carolina Chillies go by another name and that they are the Komodo Dragon chillies and widely available.  I was stunned  especially given that the recent press release not only includes a graphic showing that Carolina is hotter than Komodo but that you started selling Komodo chillies in 2015 and that of course they are two entirely different chillies - I am still waiting for a response from Customer Services regarding this.  Your press announcement remains online as do the fanciful stockists and I really would like to know if  when and where in the country they will be available?",

In April I took my car to be cleaned along with a soft top clean. This cost \u00a320 and took 40mins plus 1 hour 30mins wait. When I got the car back they had only done 2/3 of the roof and missed the middle completely. I complained and they offered a free wash and roof clean. Today I have taken it back to get my free roof clean and they told me that it was to long since I d had it done. At no point was a time limit mentioned on the free clean. He would not honour the free clean even though they failed to clean it in the first place. After I told him that there was no time limit stated he agreed to wash the car but will have to wait 1.5 - 2 hours. I can t wait 2 hours  When I asked who was waiting he couldn t say as there were no cars in the waiting bay. He has avoided cleaning the car from the start so I told him to forget it today at this point he ripped up the free car wash token so I could not have it back. So not only will I never use this diabolical service again I will make sure that all friends and relatives know about this as this is not the first time I have heard bad things about the car wash facility there.",

Is it possible that a company like Tesco deals with delivery companies like Arrow XL which are unable to give correct information and  not only that  but also tell lies? I have been waiting for the delivery of my wardrobes for over 1 month and a half. Been regularly given the wrong information  been told a date and then delivery not even going out of the depot. Been told that I was contacted when it never happened (by Arrow). Dealing now with 2 managers at Tesco customer service team: David Petrey and Lorraine Craig  still not getting anywhere.

    "post_message": "Dear Tesco   So it is now 6 weeks since we first reported that a pubic hair was found in one of your \u201cTesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurts\u201d.  We first reported the incident in store on the 2nd July and then having heard nothing from your customer service team (I asked for the incident to be investigated and then a letter from Tesco explaining the reason for the genital pube in the yoghurt) I raised this via Facebook.  As you can imagine we got an instant response  excellent I thought  we are getting somewhere.    The issue was reported via Facebook on the 27th July.  It is now the 14th August.  We have been away on holiday during that time and still no letter from Tesco when we got home.  A big disappointment.  Perhaps I was wrong and pubic hair is a key ingredient in your Tesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurts  if so would you please be kind enough to highlight this on the packaging so that the customer does not get a surprise when they find the pube located within the half eaten pot.  Happy if pubes are part of the manufacturing process  but as I said please can you make this clear on the packaging in the future so that we can avoid having to purchase any products that contain them.  It would be nice if somebody at Tesco could take this seriously as it is a major failure of your GMP processes to allow genital hairs into your products.  A hair from somebody\u2019s head or face you can understand if something finds its way in a product by mistake  but not a genital hair.  Seriously though customer service should be your number one priority  without customers you are not able to function correctly.  One customer has a bad experience they tell 10 people  if they have a good one  they may tell one.  Basic customer service is not hard and an organisation like Tesco should have it down to a fine art.  Perhaps you have just got too big and you no longer care about the people who buy from your stores and pay for your wages.  Once again I look forward to hearing from you (maybe)  an apology would be nice and possibly an explanation about how it happened  how you intend on changing your procedure to hopefully stop it happening again  and also how it has taken you so long to send a letter.    You could have walked and hand delivered a letter by now.  Many thanks.  Kind regards   Paul",

But I d also like to apologise for a) my daughter eating copious amounts of the fruit  and b) for my youngest that often chews a bit and throws it on your floor and whilst I do try my best to pick it all up in sure I miss bits. But more importantly I want to say thanks. Thanks to a young lady working in your Loughborough The Rushes store. A few weeks ago she served me and asked how I was  I explained that my youngest had just had a big operation and so we were all tired but relieved and just adjusting to life whilst she s in a big cast (being treated for hip Dysplasia so the cast is from her chest to both ankles). I left and thought she was kind and friendly but nothing else. However  this week whilst shopping again she happened to be serving us but I didn t even realise until she said  oh hi how lovely you ve brought your little one today how s she getting on with everything ? I was speechless. Instead of the usual stares and funny looks at her cast someone I didn t know was asking how she was! And she d remembered her and us as a family. I was really touched and it made me smile for the rest of the day. So thank you I have spoken to customer services at The Rushes store but I would equally appreciate you saying thank you/well done to the lady. I am determined to find her name and thank her personally too as I was so touched by her thoughtful comments at the time I completely forgot to check her name and say thank you. As you say  every little helps! And it really does x",

I booked a delivery for this morning but didn t check out in time and lost the slot. When I booked another slot I forgot to amend the address before I checked out so I got a call from the delivery driver at 7.30 this morning asking where I was. Once we d established he was outside my old house he gave me the number of customer services to call to try and sort. I spoke to a lovely lady in customer services and she pleaded with your Crawley delivery centre to deliver to my new address (sadly they wouldn t  that is my only issue with today s service though). Anyway  she was lovely  she deleted my old address from my account so it didn t happen again. Anyway  a bit later on the delivery driver calls me back. He says he was just checking in on me  he said he d seen baby formula in my delivery and had I been able to sort a delivery for today and did I need the formula? I d already rebooked my delivery for tomorrow so was sorted but he didn t have to do that  he didn t have to make sure I was ok. He was lovely. I d like to thank him again  and you should certainly be pleased you have caring staff such as him  and also lovely people like the customer services lady that commiserated with me at 7.30 this morning!

    "post_message": "My village store is Tesco Express  Belton  Norfolk.  During the week  the regular staff are brilliant  the store is welcoming and customer service is excellent. At weekends it is a totally different story.  The weekend staff have no concept of customer service. This morning - and this is normal for a Saturday - the newspapers were in a complete shambles. I could not find The Times  then realised another gentleman was also looking for one. We eventually found them  under a pile of Daily Mails! We then realised there were no magazines in the paper. We discovered them in a pile  nowhere near The Times. How many people got home to find their paper incomplete I wonder.  I told the girl on the till the papers were in a mess  to which she replied  they didn t arrive in the right order . What on earth does that mean?  To add insult to injury the lottery machine is out of action for the second weekend in as many weeks. The reason  It has run out of paper and we are waiting for it to come in.  Unbelievable.  The store is so bad at weekends  I regularly phone Tesco Customer Service who assure me they take up complaints with the management. But nothing ever happens. What a shambles!",

Ordered some furniture from tesco direct on Monday  chose a delivery slot for today (standard delivery 7am-7pm) I have sat in all day  after noticing on the online tracker that it hadn t been updated that my item had been dispatched I phoned tesco direct at 6pm to be told my item was not being delivered today! Nobody had contacted me  I spent over \u00a3150 on this one piece of furniture to finish of the collection of the rest of my bedroom furniture that I purchased from you! The only suggestion that would be made by the customer services advisor is that she could knock off the \u00a36 delivery charge and rebook my delivery slot for over a week away! This service is simply not good enough! I have asked for a refund but as it is I have been told that will take around 5-7 working days! Tesco you have some explaining to do!!",

I also commented that it would be so lovely and helpful to parents to have a free fruit snack for their children whilst in store (as I d heard about other supermarkets doing this).  This week my local store is offering free fruit for kids!  Don t know if this was a coincidence or that it was prompted by my comments but either way i m thrilled with Tesco! Thank you!",

    "post_message": "I think you need to sort out your arrangement with hermes. Ordering school clothes online was easy but delivery was terrible. Most of my order was missing. Tesco rearranged items to be sent ASAP (thank you tesco) Missing items were then received with extra trousers that I d already received (rang back to be told that I could keep them for inconvenience caused by the screw up) kept receiving 2 items I hadn t ordered for me to realise yesterday after receiving a delivery it was because they shared the same order number with the item I ordered.  Again rang back to explain why you kept sending me wrong items and what could I do with them (told me to take back to store for refund). Got woken up this morning by a delivery driver with original missing items. Rang tesco yet again as you was waiting for jumpers to come back into stock to send to me and these came this morning. Spoke to a rude person who told me under no certain terms I had to return all duplicate items to a tesco store ASAP other wise you would charge me for the extra you sent including the trousers I had been told I could keep. I ordered online as it was an easier option with 3 young kids (one with severe learning and behaviour disabilities) it s not my fault that hermes screwed up my order. It would of been easier for me to take all 3 kids in store to buy the clothes in the first place and put up with my son s meltdowns in store as I now have to go there anyway with them but this time they will have to wait patiently (not going to happen) in a line at customer services and then wait quietly (really not going to happen) for me to explain this whole mess to the staff at customers service ............  Thanks for the hassle guys",
