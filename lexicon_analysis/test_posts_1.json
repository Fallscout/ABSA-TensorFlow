You have recently changed the recipe and the bread itself!! \u00a31.80 a loaf is a staggering amount for a load that is only 380g but unfortunately my other half is polish and can not stand English bread !!! Before the recipe change it was delicious and real sourdough now it s horrid!! The otter skin is different and the cut in the top is awful!! Before it has 3 small cuts now it has a huge cut down the middle which often cuts the roof of your mouth and makes it impossible to cut ! For the past 3 days I haven t been able to buy it due to the St Andreas fault line running dow the middle!!! I was originally told via your customer service that they would check in store re baking to make sure all was being cooked correctly as its a express store i know the staff and we have had many a conversation regarding the cooking process  I have even purchased frozen and cooked myself to check it and it s the bread not the store!  Can I also add the staff at the express have been fantastic and very helpful but I am now having to complain again !!! For the fact that the store offer nothing else as a alternative and \u00a31.80 a loaf is crazy I can easily do \u00a310 a week just on bread!! I was told yesterday that the supplier was meant to be writing to me but I have heard nothing and I am getting fed up I feel I am being brushed off!!!",

This lady I think suffers with some sort of mental and learning difficulties. She was very upset and shouting. The lady at customer services called sue really showed the woman comfort and support and mostly compassion and helped calmed the lady down. She took the time to talk to this woman while everyone else was staring. The lady said she had no family to turned to and I heard sue say you can always turn to us (tesco) This woman at your superstore is remarkable she didn t have to spend the time with the distressed lady but she did with a kind loving heart. I just want to thank you for hiring a remarkable woman  I worked with people with mental and physical disabilities and not many people cared for those like sue did today with that lady. This visit to your store just for a little shopping left me feeling happy and it filled my heart knowing there is still kind people out in the world today!",

Obviously he was heartbroken  (little things matter a lot at 5 years old) I returned to the store where the item had been quickly removed from the shelf. I asked at  customer services  and was very quickly passed to the store manager  who apologised and gave (free of charge) the muchly desired chocolate log. Thus ending my boys sobbing!  So  bad point....... Abrupt staff who didn t care less about a boys feelings.  Good point... A very nice  competent manager who solved the problem in seconds.

    "post_message": "I don t normally post very much but I felt it is needed after the experience we have had with Tesco today. A few hours ago  after just having our hair done (my 13 year old daughter who is on spectrum and has dyspraxia as well as other disabilities and I) we popped into tesco.  I have been really ill since last July with acute bacterial bronchopneumonia (had it back 7 or 8 times and have had countless steroids and penicillin) and it was a treat to have our hair done as I have only been out 5 or 6 times since July. Anyway  I parked in a mother and child bay thinking it was a disabled bay.  As we got out of the car the man parked in the bay beside me said  you aren t meant to park there  and words to the effect that I had to move. I asked him why & he said  it s for children!   He was really getting quite rude and obnoxious.  I said I would move but said to him there was no need to be rude. He said  my wife is the manager at Tesco and she will tell you . The wife said  your  parking is over there!  Said in the same tone as the husband quite abruptly.  The husband then went on to say  we aren t allowed to park in  your  bays  I said OK  went to get back in my car and the man said  anyway  what is your disability  being fat .  This is an utterly disgusting thing to say and in front of my daughter.  This comes at a time when the dispatches program  which was on the other night  exposed one of their assessors bragging that he got paid \u00a320 000 a month to do assessments and all the other derogatory and inflamatory things that he said.  Genuine people that have disabilities are treated badly enough by the government  as it is  with the horrendous assessments we have to go through but you certainly do not want or indeed expect to have this type of abuse when you are just out and about minding your own business.  I was upset so I went to customer services in the Lowestoft Yarmouth store and a manager called Steve (that had been there since 2001) came to see me.  The lady on customer service practically had to almost beg him to come down and explained everything that had happened to him on the phone.  He said  what s the problem!   He said there wasn t much he could do because it s probably just a shopper!  Perhaps I could check CCTV but then I am not back in until tuesday etc  etc! This is how the conversation went until I asked my daughter  is it me or does he seem like he is not bothered about what had just happened? My daughter agreed and I then asked him why he didn t even want to take my name etc. In the end I just said don t bother and we walked out. I rang head office and first of all I was told that the child bay s are up to 5 years old as the bay s are for getting children out of the car safely. I said that I didn t know that but with a daughter on the autism spectrum (she is not road aware) and also falls so I have to hold her hand etc  then the bay s should also be for children like this. He went on to say that because it was a shopper saying what he said  there was nothing they could do! My daughter reminded me what the wife (the tesco manager) said and he then said that he would investigate!  I have been really upset all afternoon and so has my daughter and that is why I felt I had to post this.  Because the little weazle of a man wound his window up after he called me fat he might not have heard my reply so here it isn t!   One. You must be very proud of the example of a father  man and human being  that you are showing to your children. Two. I can lose weight but you are stuck with that face for the rest of your life! The way in which Tesco has handled this is utterly disgusting and the 2 poor excuses of human beings need to take a long hard look in the mirror and really think about what they did today in front of my 13 year old daughter. Please feel free to share this post and sorry it s so long. Thankyou (X-Tesco shopper)",

I have just been told by Indesit that the washing machine I was expecting today can t be delivered because the driver has a bad back... seconds after I saw him drive off.   While I ve always been satisfied with the level of customer service Tesco has continuously given me over the years I feel Indesit have totally let you down today.   Here is a copy of the email I have sent to Indesit customer services:  Dear Indesit  RE: Order number 49GXQQW6G-1  After placing an order for a washing machine (plus free recycling) through Tesco directly on the phone and stating very clearly that I live in a block of flats  I have just been told that it\u2019s not possible to get it today as the driver has a bad back.   I saw the truck pull up outside. A guy knocked on my door and said \u201cI thought it was one flight of stairs  I\u2019ll have to go and speak to the driver\u201d.   He went away and I watched the lorry drive off.   He then called me to say that  because it was 3 flights of stairs  they\u2019d have to reschedule delivery.   I telephone your customer services only to be told that a traffic warden had moved them on.   My wife was standing on the balcony all the time the lorry was there. We have deliveries daily and never has a traffic warden moved on a delivery truck. That was the first blatant lie.   When I contested this I was then told that the delivery driver \u201cmay have been alone\u201d  which wasn\u2019t the case as the driver\u2019s mate said to me that he was going to speak to the driver.  Then I was told that the delivery driver has hurt his back.  Did he hurt his back driving here? At what point did the guy who delivers washing machines for a living decide that his back was too poorly to deliver a washing machine today?  When he took one look at my stairs no doubt.  I now have to take more time off work on the hope that a guy with a good back can deliver it on Monday.  I\u2019ve decommissioned my old washing machine so can\u2019t even get a wash on until then.   Absolutely pathetic service.   Don\u2019t even bother apologising  it means nothing.   Regards   John Squirrell.  While I fully appreciate this out of your control I think someone needs to have a very stern word with that lazy delivery driver who couldn t be bothered to get my order up a few flights of stairs.",

So she did not check to see of there was the size I wanted in stock  claiming there would be none out the back. I asked of she could please explain how to use the click and collect service for clothing and she grunted  she did explain but in a tone of voice which was pretty clear she did not want to help me! Not the service u expect from anywhere. I worked on customer service desk in retail for many years and still work in the same supermarket now as a teamleader.

    "post_message": "Just relating to you my experience with your home delivery service. I have already contacted your customer service team via online message and have received an almost duplicate reply as the previous week (although this was through a phone call). This does not fill me with confidence as to the possibility of an improvement. A bit of back ground I have been a loyal customer of yours for several years and spend in excess of 7K a year across your brands and have been using your home delivery service approaching 2 years. Below is a copy of my Messages for the past two weeks and the one typed reply (dated today) I have received.   I hope you can agree that this really does not make for good customer service and would appreciate another view point from Tescos.   My messages (the two I have copies of) Hi  I have just unpacked my delivery and once again I have items that do not meet your use by date promises. As follows: Clementines dated 14/4/16  Spring Onions 13/4/16 Crumpets 14/4/16 Last week I was promised that the store concerned would be informed and this would not happen again. Unfortunately things have gotten worse.  Additionally while the other items meet your use by date promises  I have only two products that actually exceed them. Whilst I appreciate that by their very nature fresh products have only short dates  I know by experience that longer dates would be available on most of them. Can I ask are you re pickers instructed to pick those items with the shortest date but that meet you re minimum promises?  I hope that you will be able to help with the above    Hi  As a follow on from last weeks feedback  this week all items are in date. But as last week  every single item matches the guaranteed days and apart from the dairy goods not a day more. I was assured last week that you would speak to the store as I was assured that the pickers should not be picking to only the shortest dates available. Today I was in a Tesco store and looked at the dates for the products. Apart from a couple of items (fresh fruit) the other items were available for longer dates then your minimum guarantees. So it is somewhat unbelievable that out of an entire shop not one product exceeded your given dates.  Unfortunately I shop on line to shop for the best I can for a week  with this situation recurring that is not possible. I will no longer be ordering fresh produce from yourselves and will stick to dry goods  and at the end of my delivery saver I will be looking for a alternative seller.   And Tescos reply. Thanks for your email. I\u2019m responding on behalf of my colleague Russell  I hope you don\u2019t mind. Firstly  I\u2019m sorry if a number of items received as part of today\u2019s online grocery order were at the minimum of our advised freshness guarantees. I can appreciate any disappointment this would cause  particularly if you contacted us last week with similar concerns about the dates that you\u2019d received. Whilst I\u2019m unsure as to which store you visited  I can advise that your orders are sent from our Dereham branch if you were unaware. Following on from my colleague\u2019s report to the store last week  I\u2019ll be sure to address this with the Home Shopping Manager at Dereham in an effort to ensure that the pickers are offering the longest possible dates available to them at the time of picking as we would expect. Now it might be the case that you were offered the longest dates that they had but I\u2019ll happily raise this with the store and I\u2019m hopeful that you\u2019ll notice an improvement going forwards. In conclusion  I appreciate you taking the time to get in touch but if you have any further queries  please don t hesitate to contact us at: online@tesco.co.uk.",

Only realised when I went shopping back here in Kent earlier today. Phoned the store spoke to customer services. Confirmed card was there. She suggested my brother could collect it. I said no as he s a vulnerable adult. But asked if my husband could as I had to go to work. Bear in mind it s a 120 mile round trip  fuel and crossing charges. She said yes that s fine. Tell him to bring ID. Told her we have same account so he can show her his bank card and drivers licence. She said that s perfect. He gets there an hour later only to be told they can t give him it and only I can pick it up. So now I have to do another 120 mile round trip more fuel and crossing charges! Yes my stupid fault for leaving it there. But just as much your fault for wasting my time and money running around because your staff are poorly trained!",

One time the sandwich dried out before I could eat it  I still had to as there was no choice. Another time the filling leaked out into the rest of the things in my briefcase.  A month ago  I was charged full price for sandwiches that were marked down for immediate sale. This was because the floor staff did nothing to obscure the normal barcode.  What is the response each time? Bring it back with the receipt and we can give you a refund. How useless is that? If I don t eat it  I have no lunch that day. There is no where to buy a replacement within miles.   This is why I go to the Coop or Sainsbury s when there s a choice.

    "post_message": "Hi Tesco. I just received a very poor service from your customer service team through Tesco Direct which I was very shocked with as I have always had a good experience with your team. I received a faulty item from one of your partners and the woman I spoke to about it was very rude  patronising in her manner and very unhelpful. At one point I couldnt hear her and she shouted down the phone. She just sounded like she did not want to be there and after I said that I could not be in from Monday-Friday for the partner to pick up the faulty item and could they issue me with a returns label instead she sounded very irritable and said that the partner has only said between those days which I think is unfair as why should I take time off work to wait for somebody to collect an item that was faulty to begin with?? Her attitude was terrible and she practically put the phone down on me. After the call I am still none the wiser on what to do with my faulty item! Could you please advise? I feel very let down.

Cancel there order and replace it.   Ah  says I  that s a bit awkward as I placed the order via a special offer  and used Clubcard points to do it. I don t think you d be refunding me the value of the game so that I could simply reorder it? Or do you have any other suggestions or solutions? Could you change it to click and collect?  Nope. Only suggestion is to cancel. No options. No suggestions. No help. No customer care. Just cancel. I pushed a little  and subsequently was replied to by someone who called me by your staff members name ( Dianne? Really?) And then when i requested the issue was treated as a complaint  I was essentially told that the onus was on me to ensure that I PAID for a redirection  despite the fact that I was giving you a month s notice to change the address.   To call the service poor is an understatement. To say I m annoyed  even more so.

I have had to drive around using all of my petrol to find somewhere else and I didn t need to! I ve been so pleased with tesco here since day one but  recently they re letting slip - one minute having a box full of fruit for kids to have one of and then when my kids get used to it  it s taken away - myself and my wife when using the CONVENIENT scanners while we shop have a RANDOM security check EVERYTIME we enter the store and now the pure inconvenience of this! Since moving here I have spent between \u00a3150 and \u00a3200 at your store a week and I am so angry right now I have a good mind to take my custom over the road to morrisons! I suggest the staff there aren t trained properly  lazy or just full of crap but  I am not happy. I will be calling the tesco customer service first thing in the morning with my complaint and telling them about the awful service I ve had the last week! I ve just lost my dad  I ve been back here 5 days and all of the above has happened  I have a brain cell and I will not be giving my custom to a store that obviously doesn t know it s backside from its elbow.
