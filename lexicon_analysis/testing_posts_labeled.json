You have recently changed the recipe and the bread itself!! \u00a31.80 a loaf is a staggering amount for a load that is only 380g but unfortunately my other half is polish and can not stand English bread !!! Before the recipe change it was delicious and real sourdough now it s horrid!! The otter skin is different and the cut in the top is awful!! Before it has 3 small cuts now it has a huge cut down the middle which often cuts the roof of your mouth and makes it impossible to cut ! For the past 3 days I haven t been able to buy it due to the St Andreas fault line running dow the middle!!! I was originally told via your customer service that they would check in store re baking to make sure all was being cooked correctly as its a express store i know the staff and we have had many a conversation regarding the cooking process  I have even purchased frozen and cooked myself to check it and it s the bread not the store!  Can I also add the staff at the express have been fantastic and very helpful but I am now having to complain again !!! For the fact that the store offer nothing else as a alternative and \u00a31.80 a loaf is crazy I can easily do \u00a310 a week just on bread!! I was told yesterday that the supplier was meant to be writing to me but I have heard nothing and I am getting fed up I feel I am being brushed off!!!",

This lady I think suffers with some sort of mental and learning difficulties. She was very upset and shouting. The lady at customer services called sue really showed the woman comfort and support and mostly compassion and helped calmed the lady down. She took the time to talk to this woman while everyone else was staring. The lady said she had no family to turned to and I heard sue say you can always turn to us (tesco) This woman at your superstore is remarkable she didn t have to spend the time with the distressed lady but she did with a kind loving heart. I just want to thank you for hiring a remarkable woman  I worked with people with mental and physical disabilities and not many people cared for those like sue did today with that lady. This visit to your store just for a little shopping left me feeling happy and it filled my heart knowing there is still kind people out in the world today!",

Obviously he was heartbroken  (little things matter a lot at 5 years old) I returned to the store where the item had been quickly removed from the shelf. I asked at  customer services  and was very quickly passed to the store manager  who apologised and gave (free of charge) the muchly desired chocolate log. Thus ending my boys sobbing!  So  bad point....... Abrupt staff who didn t care less about a boys feelings.  Good point... A very nice  competent manager who solved the problem in seconds.

    "post_message": "I don t normally post very much but I felt it is needed after the experience we have had with Tesco today. A few hours ago  after just having our hair done (my 13 year old daughter who is on spectrum and has dyspraxia as well as other disabilities and I) we popped into tesco.  I have been really ill since last July with acute bacterial bronchopneumonia (had it back 7 or 8 times and have had countless steroids and penicillin) and it was a treat to have our hair done as I have only been out 5 or 6 times since July. Anyway  I parked in a mother and child bay thinking it was a disabled bay.  As we got out of the car the man parked in the bay beside me said  you aren t meant to park there  and words to the effect that I had to move. I asked him why & he said  it s for children!   He was really getting quite rude and obnoxious.  I said I would move but said to him there was no need to be rude. He said  my wife is the manager at Tesco and she will tell you . The wife said  your  parking is over there!  Said in the same tone as the husband quite abruptly.  The husband then went on to say  we aren t allowed to park in  your  bays  I said OK  went to get back in my car and the man said  anyway  what is your disability  being fat .  This is an utterly disgusting thing to say and in front of my daughter.  This comes at a time when the dispatches program  which was on the other night  exposed one of their assessors bragging that he got paid \u00a320 000 a month to do assessments and all the other derogatory and inflamatory things that he said.  Genuine people that have disabilities are treated badly enough by the government  as it is  with the horrendous assessments we have to go through but you certainly do not want or indeed expect to have this type of abuse when you are just out and about minding your own business.  I was upset so I went to customer services in the Lowestoft Yarmouth store and a manager called Steve (that had been there since 2001) came to see me.  The lady on customer service practically had to almost beg him to come down and explained everything that had happened to him on the phone.  He said  what s the problem!   He said there wasn t much he could do because it s probably just a shopper!  Perhaps I could check CCTV but then I am not back in until tuesday etc  etc! This is how the conversation went until I asked my daughter  is it me or does he seem like he is not bothered about what had just happened? My daughter agreed and I then asked him why he didn t even want to take my name etc. In the end I just said don t bother and we walked out. I rang head office and first of all I was told that the child bay s are up to 5 years old as the bay s are for getting children out of the car safely. I said that I didn t know that but with a daughter on the autism spectrum (she is not road aware) and also falls so I have to hold her hand etc  then the bay s should also be for children like this. He went on to say that because it was a shopper saying what he said  there was nothing they could do! My daughter reminded me what the wife (the tesco manager) said and he then said that he would investigate!  I have been really upset all afternoon and so has my daughter and that is why I felt I had to post this.  Because the little weazle of a man wound his window up after he called me fat he might not have heard my reply so here it isn t!   One. You must be very proud of the example of a father  man and human being  that you are showing to your children. Two. I can lose weight but you are stuck with that face for the rest of your life! The way in which Tesco has handled this is utterly disgusting and the 2 poor excuses of human beings need to take a long hard look in the mirror and really think about what they did today in front of my 13 year old daughter. Please feel free to share this post and sorry it s so long. Thankyou (X-Tesco shopper)",

I have just been told by Indesit that the washing machine I was expecting today can t be delivered because the driver has a bad back... seconds after I saw him drive off.   While I ve always been satisfied with the level of customer service Tesco has continuously given me over the years I feel Indesit have totally let you down today.   Here is a copy of the email I have sent to Indesit customer services:  Dear Indesit  RE: Order number 49GXQQW6G-1  After placing an order for a washing machine (plus free recycling) through Tesco directly on the phone and stating very clearly that I live in a block of flats  I have just been told that it\u2019s not possible to get it today as the driver has a bad back.   I saw the truck pull up outside. A guy knocked on my door and said \u201cI thought it was one flight of stairs  I\u2019ll have to go and speak to the driver\u201d.   He went away and I watched the lorry drive off.   He then called me to say that  because it was 3 flights of stairs  they\u2019d have to reschedule delivery.   I telephone your customer services only to be told that a traffic warden had moved them on.   My wife was standing on the balcony all the time the lorry was there. We have deliveries daily and never has a traffic warden moved on a delivery truck. That was the first blatant lie.   When I contested this I was then told that the delivery driver \u201cmay have been alone\u201d  which wasn\u2019t the case as the driver\u2019s mate said to me that he was going to speak to the driver.  Then I was told that the delivery driver has hurt his back.  Did he hurt his back driving here? At what point did the guy who delivers washing machines for a living decide that his back was too poorly to deliver a washing machine today?  When he took one look at my stairs no doubt.  I now have to take more time off work on the hope that a guy with a good back can deliver it on Monday.  I\u2019ve decommissioned my old washing machine so can\u2019t even get a wash on until then.   Absolutely pathetic service.   Don\u2019t even bother apologising  it means nothing.   Regards   John Squirrell.  While I fully appreciate this out of your control I think someone needs to have a very stern word with that lazy delivery driver who couldn t be bothered to get my order up a few flights of stairs.",

So she did not check to see of there was the size I wanted in stock  claiming there would be none out the back. I asked of she could please explain how to use the click and collect service for clothing and she grunted  she did explain but in a tone of voice which was pretty clear she did not want to help me! Not the service u expect from anywhere. I worked on customer service desk in retail for many years and still work in the same supermarket now as a teamleader.

    "post_message": "Just relating to you my experience with your home delivery service. I have already contacted your customer service team via online message and have received an almost duplicate reply as the previous week (although this was through a phone call). This does not fill me with confidence as to the possibility of an improvement. A bit of back ground I have been a loyal customer of yours for several years and spend in excess of 7K a year across your brands and have been using your home delivery service approaching 2 years. Below is a copy of my Messages for the past two weeks and the one typed reply (dated today) I have received.   I hope you can agree that this really does not make for good customer service and would appreciate another view point from Tescos.   My messages (the two I have copies of) Hi  I have just unpacked my delivery and once again I have items that do not meet your use by date promises. As follows: Clementines dated 14/4/16  Spring Onions 13/4/16 Crumpets 14/4/16 Last week I was promised that the store concerned would be informed and this would not happen again. Unfortunately things have gotten worse.  Additionally while the other items meet your use by date promises  I have only two products that actually exceed them. Whilst I appreciate that by their very nature fresh products have only short dates  I know by experience that longer dates would be available on most of them. Can I ask are you re pickers instructed to pick those items with the shortest date but that meet you re minimum promises?  I hope that you will be able to help with the above    Hi  As a follow on from last weeks feedback  this week all items are in date. But as last week  every single item matches the guaranteed days and apart from the dairy goods not a day more. I was assured last week that you would speak to the store as I was assured that the pickers should not be picking to only the shortest dates available. Today I was in a Tesco store and looked at the dates for the products. Apart from a couple of items (fresh fruit) the other items were available for longer dates then your minimum guarantees. So it is somewhat unbelievable that out of an entire shop not one product exceeded your given dates.  Unfortunately I shop on line to shop for the best I can for a week  with this situation recurring that is not possible. I will no longer be ordering fresh produce from yourselves and will stick to dry goods  and at the end of my delivery saver I will be looking for a alternative seller.   And Tescos reply. Thanks for your email. I\u2019m responding on behalf of my colleague Russell  I hope you don\u2019t mind. Firstly  I\u2019m sorry if a number of items received as part of today\u2019s online grocery order were at the minimum of our advised freshness guarantees. I can appreciate any disappointment this would cause  particularly if you contacted us last week with similar concerns about the dates that you\u2019d received. Whilst I\u2019m unsure as to which store you visited  I can advise that your orders are sent from our Dereham branch if you were unaware. Following on from my colleague\u2019s report to the store last week  I\u2019ll be sure to address this with the Home Shopping Manager at Dereham in an effort to ensure that the pickers are offering the longest possible dates available to them at the time of picking as we would expect. Now it might be the case that you were offered the longest dates that they had but I\u2019ll happily raise this with the store and I\u2019m hopeful that you\u2019ll notice an improvement going forwards. In conclusion  I appreciate you taking the time to get in touch but if you have any further queries  please don t hesitate to contact us at: online@tesco.co.uk.",

Only realised when I went shopping back here in Kent earlier today. Phoned the store spoke to customer services. Confirmed card was there. She suggested my brother could collect it. I said no as he s a vulnerable adult. But asked if my husband could as I had to go to work. Bear in mind it s a 120 mile round trip  fuel and crossing charges. She said yes that s fine. Tell him to bring ID. Told her we have same account so he can show her his bank card and drivers licence. She said that s perfect. He gets there an hour later only to be told they can t give him it and only I can pick it up. So now I have to do another 120 mile round trip more fuel and crossing charges! Yes my stupid fault for leaving it there. But just as much your fault for wasting my time and money running around because your staff are poorly trained!",

One time the sandwich dried out before I could eat it  I still had to as there was no choice. Another time the filling leaked out into the rest of the things in my briefcase.  A month ago  I was charged full price for sandwiches that were marked down for immediate sale. This was because the floor staff did nothing to obscure the normal barcode.  What is the response each time? Bring it back with the receipt and we can give you a refund. How useless is that? If I don t eat it  I have no lunch that day. There is no where to buy a replacement within miles.   This is why I go to the Coop or Sainsbury s when there s a choice.

    "post_message": "Hi Tesco. I just received a very poor service from your customer service team through Tesco Direct which I was very shocked with as I have always had a good experience with your team. I received a faulty item from one of your partners and the woman I spoke to about it was very rude  patronising in her manner and very unhelpful. At one point I couldnt hear her and she shouted down the phone. She just sounded like she did not want to be there and after I said that I could not be in from Monday-Friday for the partner to pick up the faulty item and could they issue me with a returns label instead she sounded very irritable and said that the partner has only said between those days which I think is unfair as why should I take time off work to wait for somebody to collect an item that was faulty to begin with?? Her attitude was terrible and she practically put the phone down on me. After the call I am still none the wiser on what to do with my faulty item! Could you please advise? I feel very let down.

Cancel there order and replace it.   Ah  says I  that s a bit awkward as I placed the order via a special offer  and used Clubcard points to do it. I don t think you d be refunding me the value of the game so that I could simply reorder it? Or do you have any other suggestions or solutions? Could you change it to click and collect?  Nope. Only suggestion is to cancel. No options. No suggestions. No help. No customer care. Just cancel. I pushed a little  and subsequently was replied to by someone who called me by your staff members name ( Dianne? Really?) And then when i requested the issue was treated as a complaint  I was essentially told that the onus was on me to ensure that I PAID for a redirection  despite the fact that I was giving you a month s notice to change the address.   To call the service poor is an understatement. To say I m annoyed  even more so.

I have had to drive around using all of my petrol to find somewhere else and I didn t need to! I ve been so pleased with tesco here since day one but  recently they re letting slip - one minute having a box full of fruit for kids to have one of and then when my kids get used to it  it s taken away - myself and my wife when using the CONVENIENT scanners while we shop have a RANDOM security check EVERYTIME we enter the store and now the pure inconvenience of this! Since moving here I have spent between \u00a3150 and \u00a3200 at your store a week and I am so angry right now I have a good mind to take my custom over the road to morrisons! I suggest the staff there aren t trained properly  lazy or just full of crap but  I am not happy. I will be calling the tesco customer service first thing in the morning with my complaint and telling them about the awful service I ve had the last week!

    "post_message": "Dear Tesco  Today I recieved some pretty horrific customer service from an optician in your Bishop Auckland store. When I arrived it was a frantic atmosphere  I was soon told by one of the assistants that yesterday their manager took ill and had to have his/her appendix removed  (I didn t catch if it was a man or woman)  so that explained the rush. The lady who arranged my appointment who was truly wonderful  a credit to your store  squashed me in that afternoon and took a pre test straight away so it was even quicker for me. When I returned the same lady greeted me  she talked me through the different frames you offer and again she was great. Then the optician called me through  from the moment I sat down he did not seem to have the time of day for me  I explained what I needed my glasses for and how I had been having migranes recently  but I furthur explained how I had been working a lot more and tried to make light of things with little jokes  which were not well recieved. During the appointment he was very rushed and seemed to be accusing me of faking eye-sight problems. He was changing lens  asking me if I could see a difference when I was answering honestlty he kept asking me if I was sure  and then the icing on his rude cake he said the line a health professional should never say   Are you sure  because we all love to say yes.  Overall he made me feel as though he did not have time for me  he did not want to help me  and he did not belive that I needed my glasses  (which I have been recieving on prescription from Tesco for 4 years). Sadly he was not wearing a name badge  lucky for him as I would most certainly name drop. I bought my glasses as I was in a rush  but I will not be visiting your opticians again.",

The driver accidentally snapped off the waste pipe that leads from our bathroom to the outside drain.  I appreciate that accidents happen and anticipated that Tesco would work quickly to agree a plan for fixing the damage caused.  However  despite phone calls by my husband chasing a resolution we have been passed from pillar to post with none of your managers willing to take responsibility.  On 2 April it was confirmed to us that the matter had been  escalated  to Head Office  but more than a week on  and 3 weeks after the incident we have received no communication from Head Office.

Edinburgh based. Very unhappy. So no confirmation the items made it back to store (as delivery driver had no reader with him and n paper for me to sign to say I received order)  and no confirmation at all the items would be refunded and apparently this is exactly how it should be because the manager of Corstorphne store Edinburgh says apparently and the young man in Tesco customer services that Tesco has no obligation to confirm the items were received back at store or that a refund would take place- the vegetables delivered  that were returned had gone slimy in the packet and were out of date the next day on a 10pm delivery.",

    "post_message": "HI  Apologies if this is not quite relevant to this page. Having looked on the Tesco Direct website this morning for a cordless power drill  I found one on offer with yourselves at the bargain price of \u00a319. Great!  After using the *stock in your local store* button  I established there were stock available in your Stalybridge store. Great! So off I went to the Stalybridge store  searched high and low for said drill and couldn\u2019t find it. I asked a member of staff who informed me that the Stalybridge store does not stock this item. Erm\u2026.what about available stock showing online? Not so great!  I decided to look for another store which had stock in by using the *stock in your local area* button  I noticed Oldham  Huddersfield Road had some showing in stock. So off we went  parked up and in I went. Yey I found the item I wanted on the shelf with about 10 others. Took it to the till to see \u00a333 on the self serve screen\u2026hmm I thought this item was \u00a319? After asking a member of staff about the price difference I was told that this was an online offer not store offer and to speak to customer services. Nowhere online does it mention it is an online offer only and if this was the case  why have the option to search local stores for stock at this price??  I went to customer services and explained the price issue to the lady stood behind the counter. She said also it was an online offer and not available in store. So why was I allowed to search for local stores in the area that stocked this item??? At this price??? She explained I could buy it now with click and collect and come back tomorrow after 3pm to collect it  but would have to pay \u00a32 extra\u2026..what?? \u00a32 for what exactly? So if I have to pay \u00a32 extra  then the drill is not \u00a319 as clearly stated online  but it is in fact \u00a321! What is the difference between me picking the item up today and tomorrow? They were in stock! The woman on the customer service desk was less than helpful with such an attitude. I understand she can only give me information she has  but manners and compassion wouldn\u2019t have hurt her! If that\u2019s what she calls customer service  geez id hate to see what her bad customer service is like! I have never experienced customer service like this.  I am a loyal customer of Tescos and have been for many years  im going to reconsider this! Thanks for wasting my time today tescos!  An answer to this would be appreciated asap\u2026",

I pay for delivery saver each month and have been for almost 2 years.

So if this incident is so bad then someone should have contacted your telephone team and then contacted the customers. I now have to rearrange my day to wait in for a delivery that may never come.

    "post_message": "Dear Tesco   I booked to have my grocery delivery between 7pm and 8pm tonight. By 8.30pm it hadn t arrived so I called customer services. A very helpful lady looked into the issue and said the delivery driver had tried and failed to deliver at 7.03pm  and had left a card. I can assure you both my husband and I were in at that time and in fact  I had been in the house all day. The doorbell works and there is a door that can be knocked on too. No card was left nor was any delivery attempted at my house. The customer services lady then contacted the delivery driver on our behalf who said he d try again at the end of his other deliveries and that she d call back at 9.30pm to see if we had received our groceries. At 9.30pm I got my call  from a man at the depot this time  who said they were organising another driver to meet the original one  collect our order and deliver it to us. Great  we thought  only two hours late but at least it s on its way. 10.10pm and we were still waiting for our order so I called the man back to see how things were going. This time I was told they can t deliver and will bring it tomorrow instead.  It is way past my bedtime  Tesco  and I wish this had been the solution originally rather than making me wait up all this time. Would I still be waiting now  had I not made that phone call? Now I sincerely hope  Tesco  that 1) I will not incur another delivery charge  since I understand that is the practice if the customer misses their original delivery slot  as I was actually at home at 7.03pm and 2) my delivery does indeed arrive tomorrow.  Yours faithfully  a tired customer.",

    "post_message": "Hi  I have sent this through to your customer services email but wanted to post on here  just to make sure the people mentioned get the feedback they deserve. I attended your Pontardawe store around lunch time on Thursday 31st March and would like to say thank you for the great customer service I received. This what happened:- It was my daughter s 5th birthday in 2 days so I had to go shopping for food for her birthday party and had to take my 2 children with me (age 2 and 4 at the time). Shopping with children can be stressful at the best of times  let alone when you have something important like a party to plan for. I had already been to 2 shops previously to visiting your Pontardawe store and had been out of the house with my children for 3 hours already so by this point I was slowly losing my patience and they were understandably bored. My son had started to throw a temper tantrum in the trolley and was screaming  I had a few looks off people judging me  who obviously didn t know the whole story. This wasn t what Peter did instead he asked my son what was the matter. And although my son didn t answer  he immediately stopped crying  which broke the tension. Peter was very friendly and carried on interacting with both of my children and by the time we walked away my children were much happier. At the time I didn t thank Peter as I was very stressed and in my own little world. I then proceeded to the self service checkout while I was scanning my items Gerry was talking to my children and kept them amused while I finished scanning my items. This is when I realised I should have thanked Peter for his earlier intervention. By the time I left your store I was much less stressed and my children were in a better mood too  which is very unusual for a shopping trip with children. People are very quick to complain (myself included) but forget to say thank you for good service. Peter and Gerry provided exceptional customer service and what may not have seemed like a big deal to them made a huge difference to my day!",

I phoned and got a very rude man who told me that he couldn t take any bank details over the phone and I had to fill in another form  which I did. The error I had made the first time was actually due to the form not allowing 0 to be the first digit  so I wrote this on my email. Was told in an automated reply that it would take 10 working days. Nothing happened so I sent an email  no reply. Asked through private message on here  and was told you had checked and it was going to be 14 working days which was today.

    "post_message": "I have to say I very disappointed with the customer service I am receiving with the regards to a dangerous dryer purchased from Tesco and Hotpoint. I contacted Hotpoint two and a half months ago and was assured that I would receive a date for an engineer to visit within 8 weeks. It was hard enough to get in contact with Hotpoint as they don t answer their phone lines. Needless to say  Hotpoint failed to get in contact with me to arrange the engineer. As my dryer was purchased from Tesco Direct  I also contacted them to express my concerns about the dangerous dryer over 6 weeks ago. I was informed that I would be passed to a customer service agent who would be in contact with me within 24 hours. This never happened. I feel very disappointed that Tesco and Hotpoint appear to be acting in a negligent way towards their customers. Neither company appears to be taking responsibility for the products they are producing/selling.",

I called customer services first thing this morning who said they would get my local store manager to call me and see if they could arrange a delivery of missing items for this evening.

I explained that I need to know whether I need to replace the items on my way home so that I can cook dinner but this didn t help. Still waiting and still have no idea whether I need to buy the food again on my way home. At no point has anyone offered me any sort of compensation for the calls and time out of my day to sort this  or a refund for the missing items or for the delivery  given that I am likely to have to make a special trip to buy these items when the whole point of me paying to get them delivered last night was so that I didn t have to go to the store myself and would have the food in time to cook this evening s dinner.",

    "post_message": "DO NOT WASTE MONEY GO TO SPECSAVERS Ok so after waiting almost 6 weeks I ve had enough. I paid \u00a3197 for two pairs of glasses they arrived to start with fairly quickly. I advised them three times (by going into store and calling the main head office) that I couldn t see. Finally I am told by the head office just pop back to the store they ll retest you yeah right!  No I had to come back a few days later after a major operation I did not need to be making my fourth trip to the optician. But I did to find out that the optician had written the axis as 15 instead of 115 I was offered a bunch of flowers for my trouble at the time I just wanted my glasses so I said no please just get my glasses sorted. Now I have made several calls to the rubbish liars at customer services head office as in the mean time I ve had to love house but my glasses have to go to the original store first.  20 days later my clear pair arrive at Northampton I m called as they need to send them to Ely. They get to Ely three days later to find out that the sun glasses (bearing in mind the hot weather is almost over now) haven t been made yet!!! So I call customer rubbish sorry services again at head office no they haven t been made no due date I ll get a regional manager to call you here I am 5 days later no call!!! Ha ha ha then I m asked to do a customer satisfaction questionnaire are you kidding me!!! Yes in still 26 days later have no second pair no idea when they will arrive and no customer service at all. The clear pair are uncomfortable and not worth the money  My advice better service and glasses at Specsavers don t even bother with Tescos!!! I played nice till now and now I ve had enough please feel free to share my experience as I would hate for other people to suffer such a poor service.",

When we went to collect them they said they didn t know about the order and then changed to say they had a problem and they were being proven and would be ready in an hour and a half . We expressed that we were not happy but would return in an hour and a half. We then went to complain to customer services who said they would check what the problem was and would phone me to confirm the problem. My husband returned at the specified time to be told there was no order in the book  then they found it  and was then told they hadn t put them in the oven yet!!!! Confused??? Me too  it seems there was a catalogue of errors in the store yesterday as we had no phonecall from customer services either! We finally had our rolls which we had to then cool under fans in order to use them . Yesterday was already a stressful day without all this. I don t usually complain but I was really upset. I would like to add though in general I love shopping in your store  the staff are always friendly and helpful. Thanks",

I have had tonsillitis since last Thursday and I am on cocodamol and cannot drive due to my tablets that is the reason I ordered a delivery  now I have no food in my apartment and no way to go out and get any. Sophie from stretford tesco put her manager on the phone and he stated that he has no drivers coming to my area for the rest of the day and offered no alternative to this situation. I am now \u00a391.00 down due to your incompetence . I am now without food. What are you going to do- bearing in mind this delivery was meant to be here between 10-11. I am not happy at all.

I will then take my bill into Tesco Inverurie and show it to the Duty Mgr so they can see just how much custom they are losing in me alone. I have already emailed Tesco Customer Service to advise them of this. I suggest ANYONE can do this - there is no need to be confrontational or rude about it....just save your alternate choice grocery bill  head for Tesco afterwards  speak to the Duty Mgr & continue to do this every time you shop until they get the message. If enough people ALL OVER the UK do this it will get our point across in spades that Tesco shoppers are NOT amused and their bowing to what amounts to anti-Scotland racism will cost them millions.   Maybe time for a rethink?????",

It seems as though they are as attainable as a unicorn steak and not only that  your customer services team in fact know nothing about them.  This issue first arose after making a special effort to try and locate them in the London stores listed as stockists on your website.  None of the stores had them in stock which is why I contacted Customer Services.  The first person told me to check in the stores listed on your website (which was a point I had made clear in my first email) and then told me that there are supplier issues and they don t know when they ll be back in stock after telling me they are not in stock.  Another person apologised for the  rigmarole  and said that the confusion has arisen from the fact that Carolina Chillies go by another name and that they are the Komodo Dragon chillies and widely available.  I was stunned  especially given that the recent press release not only includes a graphic showing that Carolina is hotter than Komodo but that you started selling Komodo chillies in 2015 and that of course they are two entirely different chillies - I am still waiting for a response from Customer Services regarding this.  Your press announcement remains online as do the fanciful stockists and I really would like to know if  when and where in the country they will be available?",

I came into the store at 06:00AM in a panic as I ve left my bank card in the store. Simply asked if it had been handed in and the woman didn t seem bothered in the slightest.   Firstly told me we don t open here until 08:00  I then explain I m wondering if my bank card has been handed in here. In which her reply was I don t know. I then ask politely can you check for me  she says no I can t it might be in the cash office. Again I say can you phone or find out for me. Finally says no I can t do either of that I ll be able to in an hour.  Most extremely awkward middle aged woman with a very bad attitude and unhelpful.   I hope if anyone else looses something important  your staff seem more professional and interested!",

In April I took my car to be cleaned along with a soft top clean. This cost \u00a320 and took 40mins plus 1 hour 30mins wait. When I got the car back they had only done 2/3 of the roof and missed the middle completely. I complained and they offered a free wash and roof clean. Today I have taken it back to get my free roof clean and they told me that it was to long since I d had it done. At no point was a time limit mentioned on the free clean. He would not honour the free clean even though they failed to clean it in the first place. After I told him that there was no time limit stated he agreed to wash the car but will have to wait 1.5 - 2 hours. I can t wait 2 hours  When I asked who was waiting he couldn t say as there were no cars in the waiting bay. He has avoided cleaning the car from the start so I told him to forget it today at this point he ripped up the free car wash token so I could not have it back. So not only will I never use this diabolical service again I will make sure that all friends and relatives know about this as this is not the first time I have heard bad things about the car wash facility there.",

Is it possible that a company like Tesco deals with delivery companies like Arrow XL which are unable to give correct information and  not only that  but also tell lies? I have been waiting for the delivery of my wardrobes for over 1 month and a half. Been regularly given the wrong information  been told a date and then delivery not even going out of the depot. Been told that I was contacted when it never happened (by Arrow). Dealing now with 2 managers at Tesco customer service team: David Petrey and Lorraine Craig  still not getting anywhere. This matter need to be dealt at higher level as this is not the service any decent company gives to customers. I need my wardrobes ASAP  I want to file a formal complaint but nobody is listening  so turning to Facebook   I need somebody to listen and take the matter in hands!",

    "post_message": "Dear Tesco   So it is now 6 weeks since we first reported that a pubic hair was found in one of your \u201cTesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurts\u201d.  We first reported the incident in store on the 2nd July and then having heard nothing from your customer service team (I asked for the incident to be investigated and then a letter from Tesco explaining the reason for the genital pube in the yoghurt) I raised this via Facebook.  As you can imagine we got an instant response  excellent I thought  we are getting somewhere.    The issue was reported via Facebook on the 27th July.  It is now the 14th August.  We have been away on holiday during that time and still no letter from Tesco when we got home.  A big disappointment.  Perhaps I was wrong and pubic hair is a key ingredient in your Tesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurts  if so would you please be kind enough to highlight this on the packaging so that the customer does not get a surprise when they find the pube located within the half eaten pot.  Happy if pubes are part of the manufacturing process  but as I said please can you make this clear on the packaging in the future so that we can avoid having to purchase any products that contain them.  It would be nice if somebody at Tesco could take this seriously as it is a major failure of your GMP processes to allow genital hairs into your products.  A hair from somebody\u2019s head or face you can understand if something finds its way in a product by mistake  but not a genital hair.  Seriously though customer service should be your number one priority  without customers you are not able to function correctly.  One customer has a bad experience they tell 10 people  if they have a good one  they may tell one.  Basic customer service is not hard and an organisation like Tesco should have it down to a fine art.  Perhaps you have just got too big and you no longer care about the people who buy from your stores and pay for your wages.  Once again I look forward to hearing from you (maybe)  an apology would be nice and possibly an explanation about how it happened  how you intend on changing your procedure to hopefully stop it happening again  and also how it has taken you so long to send a letter.    You could have walked and hand delivered a letter by now.  Many thanks.  Kind regards   Paul",

But I d also like to apologise for a) my daughter eating copious amounts of the fruit  and b) for my youngest that often chews a bit and throws it on your floor and whilst I do try my best to pick it all up in sure I miss bits. But more importantly I want to say thanks. Thanks to a young lady working in your Loughborough The Rushes store. A few weeks ago she served me and asked how I was  I explained that my youngest had just had a big operation and so we were all tired but relieved and just adjusting to life whilst she s in a big cast (being treated for hip Dysplasia so the cast is from her chest to both ankles). I left and thought she was kind and friendly but nothing else. However  this week whilst shopping again she happened to be serving us but I didn t even realise until she said  oh hi how lovely you ve brought your little one today how s she getting on with everything ? I was speechless. Instead of the usual stares and funny looks at her cast someone I didn t know was asking how she was! And she d remembered her and us as a family. I was really touched and it made me smile for the rest of the day. So thank you I have spoken to customer services at The Rushes store but I would equally appreciate you saying thank you/well done to the lady. I am determined to find her name and thank her personally too as I was so touched by her thoughtful comments at the time I completely forgot to check her name and say thank you. As you say  every little helps! And it really does x",

I booked a delivery for this morning but didn t check out in time and lost the slot. When I booked another slot I forgot to amend the address before I checked out so I got a call from the delivery driver at 7.30 this morning asking where I was. Once we d established he was outside my old house he gave me the number of customer services to call to try and sort. I spoke to a lovely lady in customer services and she pleaded with your Crawley delivery centre to deliver to my new address (sadly they wouldn t  that is my only issue with today s service though). Anyway  she was lovely  she deleted my old address from my account so it didn t happen again. Anyway  a bit later on the delivery driver calls me back. He says he was just checking in on me  he said he d seen baby formula in my delivery and had I been able to sort a delivery for today and did I need the formula? I d already rebooked my delivery for tomorrow so was sorted but he didn t have to do that  he didn t have to make sure I was ok. He was lovely. I d like to thank him again  and you should certainly be pleased you have caring staff such as him  and also lovely people like the customer services lady that commiserated with me at 7.30 this morning! Unfortunately I didn t catch either of their names.",

I could not find The Times  then realised another gentleman was also looking for one. We eventually found them  under a pile of Daily Mails! We then realised there were no magazines in the paper. We discovered them in a pile  nowhere near The Times. How many people got home to find their paper incomplete I wonder.  I told the girl on the till the papers were in a mess  to which she replied  they didn t arrive in the right order . What on earth does that mean?  To add insult to injury the lottery machine is out of action for the second weekend in as many weeks. The reason  It has run out of paper and we are waiting for it to come in.  Unbelievable.

Nobody had contacted me  I spent over \u00a3150 on this one piece of furniture to finish of the collection of the rest of my bedroom furniture that I purchased from you! The only suggestion that would be made by the customer services advisor is that she could knock off the \u00a36 delivery charge and rebook my delivery slot for over a week away! This service is simply not good enough! I have asked for a refund but as it is I have been told that will take around 5-7 working days! Tesco you have some explaining to do!!",

I also commented that it would be so lovely and helpful to parents to have a free fruit snack for their children whilst in store (as I d heard about other supermarkets doing this).

    "post_message": "I think you need to sort out your arrangement with hermes. Ordering school clothes online was easy but delivery was terrible. Most of my order was missing. Tesco rearranged items to be sent ASAP (thank you tesco) Missing items were then received with extra trousers that I d already received (rang back to be told that I could keep them for inconvenience caused by the screw up) kept receiving 2 items I hadn t ordered for me to realise yesterday after receiving a delivery it was because they shared the same order number with the item I ordered.  Again rang back to explain why you kept sending me wrong items and what could I do with them (told me to take back to store for refund). Got woken up this morning by a delivery driver with original missing items. Rang tesco yet again as you was waiting for jumpers to come back into stock to send to me and these came this morning. Spoke to a rude person who told me under no certain terms I had to return all duplicate items to a tesco store ASAP other wise you would charge me for the extra you sent including the trousers I had been told I could keep. I ordered online as it was an easier option with 3 young kids (one with severe learning and behaviour disabilities) it s not my fault that hermes screwed up my order. It would of been easier for me to take all 3 kids in store to buy the clothes in the first place and put up with my son s meltdowns in store as I now have to go there anyway with them but this time they will have to wait patiently (not going to happen) in a line at customer services and then wait quietly (really not going to happen) for me to explain this whole mess to the staff at customers service ............

She also identified through our conversation that we had inadvertently dropped a mascara through the trolley on our rounds as someone had recently returned it to her to be put back on the shelf...saving me the upset of the  tween  it was purchased for!!!

    "post_message": "ANYONE CONSIDERING ORDERING FROM THE EASY ENTERTAINING RANGE PLEASE BE AWARE THAT EVEN IF YOU PROVIDE TESCO WITH THE REQUIRED NOTICE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR ORDER!!!!! I recently placed an order for the Tesco Easy Entertaining range for a special party we were having on Saturday 6th Aug.  They ask that you give 3/4 days notice  more on some items when placing the order. I assumed that this was so they could ensure they had sufficient time to prepare my food.  Unfortunately  I was wrong. I received an email Fri evening  my delivery was booked for between 10pm and 11pm  to advise me that the mini classic cupcakes I d ordered were unavailable.  I spoke to customer service who said he would contact the dot com manager in the store who would ring me back.  He didn t  but the c/s advisor did to let me know there was a supplier issue and that I hadn t been charged. Really! I certainly would not expect to pay for something you couldn t supply.  My delivery arrived early and the driver was lovely  the only positive thing about this whole experience  but when checking my order we found that not only were the 36 classic cupcakes missing but so were 36 mini cupcakes and 60 mini savoury eggs. The driver was very apologetic  he knew nothing about the shortages  even though they are supposed to be advised.  Once again I had to ring customer service to complain. The girl I spoke to found it hard to believe there were no substitutes at all for the mini savoury eggs. I know I d ordered the value range but surely supplying the next price range up would have provided better customer service than sending nothing at all!  Saturday morning was spent trying to source 72 mini cupcakes and 60 mini savoury eggs  something that I had expected to prevent by ordering from the Easy Entertaining range.  Having successfully found the necessary items in Asda  I returned home to receive a phone call from my local Tesco to tell me the cupcakes had come in on the delivery that morning and were available if I wanted them. I told her  very politely  that I d had to get them elsewhere and that I wouldn t be using or recommending that service to anyone  ANYONE CONSIDERING ORDERING FROM THE EASY ENTERTAINING RANGE PLEASE BE AWARE THAT EVEN IF YOU PROVIDE TESCO WITH THE REQUIRED NOTICE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR ORDER!!!!!",

    "post_message": "2 weeks ago.. Our Microwave from Tesco s caught fire when I say caught fire I mean flames/smoke and the most awful smell ever  it required a fire blanket etc to put out the flames..  But this could have been a much different post as my little boy was in the kitchen at the time..  I decided was gonna take my barely used microwave back to the store (Oak Tree Lane  mansfield) I had the but could I heck as like find the receipt  I have every receipt back to 2010 lol) Once in-store I explained the situation to Mel (Tech) he told me not to worry as customer service could track the transaction my club card history.. and phoned them for me-i explained the situation to customer service although they were helpful they said it would take up to two weeks to track the transaction.. I was a bit miffed but ok with this as I really just wanted Tesco to be aware there was an issue with this microwave.. especially given the fact it had also scorched my worktop on a 30 second bottle warm.  However Mel wasn t.. he looked over the microwave and was shocked/almost 4 days later the smell in-store was toxic from the microwave.  He said he was going to get the store manager and show him.. again the manager was shocked..  Mel said there was no way this should have happened and that if there was anything that could be done he d find it..  During my time in-store he listened.. was polite/knowledgeable and curtious and a true gentleman.  He understood that I d been uncomfortable about taking the item back but reassured me I d done the right thing..  In the end I did get a full refund on my microwave but opted to do some research before purchasing another microwave.  I think alot of staff and other stores learn alot from this guy..  Fabulous customer service!!  P.s. I have tried numerous times to write this review your website using the correct methods but It won t work/save???",

On the Monday I called your customer service line and was told sorry there is not a lot they can do as its down to the shop to investigate.   She had to leave all her shopping behind and wait 5 days for a new card  My daughter is a young mother of 2 and is carry TWINS.

I mentioned it to the staff member who was emptying the cage who told me to go and speak to customer service. Which I did  and was told straight away without hesitation that it would be sorted. I was advised to buy a replacement coat or bring the original receipt in  for my coat. I went away feeling annoyed and stressed as I had so much other stuff to do for Xmas.

    "post_message": "Hello      I was shopping in your Tesco Silverburn store on Monday 18th December when after being in for around 20 minutes; I noticed my Next shopping bag wasn\u2019t on my person anymore. I dropped my basket and ran around the aisles I\u2019d been to see if I had mislaid it etc. It wasn\u2019t there. I started to really panic and get quite upset as the next bag had \u00a370 worth of baby outfits inside. I\u2019d only bought them 20 minutes previous. I ran to the customer services desk  where they told me no (and without any obvious empathy either) I asked the security men who were standing by the door  at the CCTV cameras  if anyone had handed to them. They said no. I said would there be any way they could quickly check past 5 minutes of cctv incase the bag and potential thief were still in the store. They told me no and that I would have to come back tomorrow?! (Helpful). I  again  ran around all the aisles. At this point  I was actually crying with panic because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to buy these presents again. I asked a few employees again if anything had been handed in. They all said no... One actually said \u2018naw hen  it\u2019s probably been lifted!\u2019\u2026 Not very helpful and frankly quite upsetting.      I stood at the door. Revisited the customer service desk and the various other desks (opticians etc.) a couple more times before I eventually gave up and left to go home. On the way home  I remembered an area I hadn\u2019t revisited. I tried calling customer services to see if there would be any way they could check the specific area for me  as I don\u2019t live near this particular Tesco. I got through to a call centre. They told me to drive back if I wanted to check it. (Wish I\u2019d have thought of that myself Mrs Brains!?!)  From that point on  I got the local customer services number and proceeded to call the desk 13 times in total over a 6 hour period. They either never answered or hung up when they heard my voice. I spoke to one lady from these 13 attempts who seemed to be the only helpful employee in the whole store. She did check the area for me- unfortunately the bag wasn\u2019t there either.     I returned to the store the following day to query the CCTV. The gentleman phoned his colleague to come down to the main entrance where my partner & I were waiting. I told him the exact time I entered the store  what I was wearing  what bags I was holding and told him the first place I headed for. He left and told me to come back in 15 minutes once he\u2019d looked at the playback. When he returned  the gentleman said these exact words \u2018Yes I can see you on the camera. You came in with the bag and left without it\u2019\u2026..    He\u2019d spent 15/20 apparently looking at CCTV... to tell me that? Useless information that I quite obviously KNEW. He then proceeded to lie to me... \u2018When you came in  you veered over to the right and I didn\u2019t catch where you went after that\u2019... I replied \u2018No  I didn\u2019t go over to the right at all? I went straight ahead. I went straight for the wrapping paper?\u2019 He replied \u2018No cos I seen you and your boyfriend go that way?\u2019\u2026    My boyfriend hadn\u2019t been with me.       I am a retail manager. I regularly watch CCTV. I asked him had he not followed my route? Had it been the other way around... I would have followed a customer in segments to see at what point the bag wasn\u2019t on their person anymore... Not only could I narrow it down and save myself time... but I also then be able to inform the customer of where & when exactly the bag was taken. I told him this. I wrote down my full route of the store and asked him to look at it for me. He said it would take him couple of hours... I reluctantly agreed that he could just call me instead. He said he\u2019d phone me that night once he could confirm what the fate of the bag was. After this  I began to wonder how he\u2019d seen me leave without my shopping bag if he hadn\u2019t followed my route? Probably another lie...     That was the 19th December. It\u2019s now the 31st. I\u2019ve never received that call back.   As a retail manager  I am genuinely appalled at this level of customer service. To show no empathy to a young girl who is visibly upset is bad enough. To ignore calls  hang up on customers  lie to their face and never give them the call back promised to them is horrific.   To make matters worse  I\u2019ve since been informed by an employee of the next store that I also revisited  that Tesco Silverburn are hopeless at helping people in circumstances like this. That is awful. I will never step foot in your store again. I know Tesco won\u2019t care that 1 person  a number like me won\u2019t shop there again... but hopefully people reading this never have to rely on the staff of the Tesco Silverburn store ever again. They are useless and quite clearly have no regard for their customers and their customers\u2019 possessions.",

On numeorus occasions they have snapped at customers for asking on issues why actual prices are different than display prices. I and my mother are regular customers  here for more than 6 years and previously we are customers at tesco kajang. Further necessities like sugar or salt or vegetables if out stocks are not stocked promptly. The cashiers or staffs loosely will address most female customers as aunty.They refer my mother who is in her mid 60s as aunty and I in mid 30s as aunty.What is the actual meaning of aunty? Does cashiers and staffs at UK Tesco refer to their female customers as aunty? Why in the earth they make us as their relatives? And today when I asked a temporary cashier at counter 17 around 7.30 pm  why she addressed me as aunty  she replied thats what they were trained to call customers like that. She didn t even apologise for wrong use of language.When I correct her that she is in customer service line and she should address customers promptly like sir  madam or ms (in malay cik or encik).Mind you I was not shouting or scolding at her.However she snapped and started to throw the items I have purchased  after  she finished scanning prices and when I asked her to stop doing that she didnt bother to apologise or stop. She continued to throw my credit card and receipt. I immediately I told I will lodge a complaint against her  she just said thank you very much. I can t bother to complaint there as previously other rude incident took place in front of the line leader or supervisor but he didnt bother.Disappointed with bad customer service.",

The driver was on his own  he took up 2 spaces and proceeded to stare at me the whole time I walked towards the door. I reported that he was in a parent and child space to customer service and even pointed him out  he verbally abused me in the store and the lady I reported it to asked him if he was parked in a P&C space  he replied yes but I only came in for a magazine  to which she replied  oh  ok then .....  The car park wasn t full  and in fact there was a vacant parking space right outside the door.   How is it acceptable for this to happen? Maybe I should park in the disabled parking and do the same? Or perhaps I should park across 2 normal spaces so I have room to get my child out of the car?",

The home delivery vans are always iny street as a lot of people use it. I don t no if they have mobile de-tagers in them?

I went there yesterday to exchange a gift my neephew had for Christmas. I was told to take a non electrical toy to the electrical desk  when asked why as it s not electrical the staff member said she would serve me. I explained I didn t have a receipt and she just smiled at me. I chose a few items went back to the desk and she told me I had to find items to the same value and couldn t put the difference on a gift card. So off I went and did some food shopping. I picked up some wrapping paper and a member of staff told me they were still in the 3 for 2 offer even though they were reduced. I took all my bits to the desk to get served for the 3rd time and asked her to check if the paper was in the offer to which she smiled at me in-between chatting to her mates at the desk. I was told yes (in reply to my question about the paper and it came up on the till) Brilliant I thought  managed to pay the difference for my good in between her chatting to her mates and hardly looking at us let alone speak to us. She was so engrossed in her conversation  she didn t ask if I had a Clubcard. So after serving me I asked her to add the point to which she huffed. I left the store biting my tongue. Got home and checked my receipt and the wrapping paper didn t come up as 3 for 2. Im more annoyed with the fact that she had no time for us as customers and was more interested in talking to her colleague mates and was dismissive of us more than the fact she blatantly had no idea i had asked about the paper and just smiled at me.",

However  Tesco bank were not so helpful. We pay money into Tesco clubcard plus account every month throughout the year to pay for our Christmas shopping. When we came to pay this year however we were told to use alternative payment even though we knew there was enough money in the account. Customer service phoned the bank who couldnt help as account wasnt set up for phone banking. This account was set up in 1997 when it wasnt the norm for telephone banking and we have used the card every year without a problem. So that was the end of that  they couldnt do anything about the fact we had no way of paying for our Christmas food. Thank you Tesco  you have a lot of our money in an account we can t access until we get sent a password in the post <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A0>.

    "post_message": "A couple of weeks ago I did my weekly shop at Tesco Leytonstone with my son who is 7. He likes to ride his scooter to Tesco as we live locally. He always leaves his scooter in the correct place at the front with all the other scooters and buggies. After we finished our shop we were leaving when we realised we had forgotten my sons scooter so he ran back inside to get it. My son came back out in tears. He told me your security guard had called him a  stupid boy  because he had knocked someone elses scooter over. I went back inside to ask the security guard what had happened but immediately he was very aggressive verbally and started shouting at me. I asked for his name but he declined to give it to me so I took a picture of him that I can show you privately to identify. I then went to customer services and asked to speak with a manager. I told your manager what had happened and it really was evident my son was telling the truth because as I was telling the manager the security guard was telling other people about it and pointing at us. Your manager apologised to me and my son and let him chose out a box of chocolates as an apology which was very kind of you. Another of your workers at customer services told me that this was not the first time there had been problems with security guards but that there was little to be done because they are employed by a different company and not Tesco. As we were leaving the security guard was shouting at the manager who was trying to deal with the situation. I found this appalling but felt it better to leave it at that.  However I have now felt compelled to write a complaint on here because the security guard has since appear intimidating to us when we have gone back to Tesco Leytonstone on different occasion to do our weekly shop. Last week as myself and my son were walking into Tesco to do our weekly shop he pointed at us out to another security guard and was I assume telling his colleague god knows what about us. I ignored this. However today I popped in to Tesco Leytonstone with my son to pick up some last minute items. As we were walking down one of the isles the security guard walked up to us  stopped and starred at my son up and down. Again I ignored this and just pulled my son along by the hand.   This is not acceptable behaviour. I should be able to do my shopping in Tesco without feeling intimidated or worried. I live local and have shopped at Tesco Leytonstone since it opened. In fact I was present at Tesco Leytonstone when Dirty Den from Eastenders came to cut the ribbon to officially open the store! I spend a lot of money at Tesco Leytonstone as we dont have much of a high street and its literally around the corner from me but I will be forced to shop elsewhere should this sort of intimidation and unprofessional behaviour continue. I am being treated like what feels a potential thief and who knows what he has told other staff about me/us? If you are unable to do anything about this security guard then please could you provide me with the security firm he works for so I can make an official complaint to them about him.",

Ordered some Christmas presents from Tesco photo on 15th December when their website state that the last order date for Christmas delivery is the 16th December.  Well after no correspondence from Tesco or the company that deal with their photo gifts  Max Spielmann  and with it now being Christmas eve and no sign of my gifts I am quite frankly appalled at their lack of Customer service and delivery process.  Considering my partner ordered from Photobox on Sunday 18th and received his calendar by the 21st I think people should bear this in mind when thinking about where to order your photo gifts from!!",

    "post_message": "Just wanted to say how disappointed i was with tesco customer service today.  My mum sent my family and i a \u00a3100 tesco voucher to spend on extra christmas treats but sadly when our post arrived this morning it had been removed from the envelope.  Royal mail refused to even search the postmans bag and so we turned to tesco for some help. After trawling every shopping bag in the house my very upset mum managed to find a receipt that had the whole gift card number on it. Several calls to tesco later and they agreed to block the card from being used and even offered \u00a350 (sent to us via royal mail - no thanks!!) As a goodwill gesture instead of the \u00a3100 voucher that had already been purchased. We requested a number of times that the full balance be transfered to a new card or even an online evoucher as we use tesco online weekly to do our \u00a3200 food shop. This was absolutely  point blank refused. Why? We can prove the card was purchased  have receipts and credit card statements to back this up yet tesco  2 days before christmas wouldnt allow us the gift that had already been paid for for us.   We now have to rely on a post office claim form to POSSIBLY come up trumps and find our missing voucher but have been told it could take up to 12 weeks just to be processed. Assuming it hasnt already been pocketed by someone - likely!  #tesco  i am incredibly disappointed in your lack of cooperation today. The gift card was lost  we didnt want a refund  just the funds transfered so they could be spent in your store!  Bah humbug!",

No  it was under \u00a310 and not one of  the  Christmas toys of the year. She just wanted some pyjamas to go with the Sindy doll. For some reason  the doll is available on line but the outfits arent?? I had friends and family search in their Tesco for the outfits  but with no luck.  So I thought I would contact you. It all looked extremely hopeful. You have me two stores locally that were due delivery of the outfit my daughter wanted  you ensured that one was going to be put by for a friend to collect for me. My friend went in as arranged and one hadn t been put by. She was told they were out of stock and were due delivery on a Monday evening so to go back in Tuesday morning. Still nothing. We were told they were due in but couldn t say when  so my friend has been in every day checking for me. I was told they were out of stock  then I was told that store was due some but couldn t tell me when.  In the end I had to make the decision to get an alternative product for my daughter as you clearly weren t going to produce any.  I feel we have been sent on a wild goose chase  been made promises that haven t been kept and been lied to. Not great customer service from Tesco and I haven t got my daughter exactly what she asked Santa for Christmas. Thanks for that Tesco!!",

    "post_message": "I am absolutely appalled with Tesco Grocery today. My groceries were delivered on time  but with several Christmas dinner items missing. I immediately called customer services who contacted the driver to arrange re-delivery. The driver returned and stated that he had delivered my items to another customer and although he had been back there  he didn\u2019t have my missing items. He offered me a crate of items to look through for my items \u2018or something similar\u2019  there weren\u2019t any. He advised he would contact the warehouse with a list of my missing items and have them sent out to me today. I contacted Customer services again (10am) to ensure that this had happened - it had not.   Customer services contacted the store and called me back stating the items would be redelivered today and that the store would call me with a time slot.  At 1:30pm I had not heard from the store so  again  contacted customer services to enquire about my missing groceries. I was put on hold while the store was contacted only to be told that the store \u2018didn\u2019t have the man power to redelivery my groceries today as they already had 120 redeliveries from yesterday\u2019. The customer services manager advised that my items would then be refunded.  I asked to be transferred to a team leader who advised he would again contact the store or try to have the items put aside in a local express store. On calling back  he  again  said the store would not redeliver due to a lack of \u2018man power\u2019 and that no local store had all of the items that were missing - what a surprise two days before Christmas!   Clearly  Tesco  you have overstretched yourselves and are unable to fulfil the orders that you have taken. Online grocery shopping is supposed to be convenient and stress free - it has been neither today. After one redelivery  4 phone calls and 6 hours of waiting  I now have to shop for my missing goods.  Absolutely unacceptable.",
