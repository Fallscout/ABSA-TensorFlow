    "post_message": "Dear Tesco  Today I recieved some pretty horrific customer service from an optician in your Bishop Auckland store. When I arrived it was a frantic atmosphere  I was soon told by one of the assistants that yesterday their manager took ill and had to have his/her appendix removed  (I didn t catch if it was a man or woman)  so that explained the rush. The lady who arranged my appointment who was truly wonderful  a credit to your store  squashed me in that afternoon and took a pre test straight away so it was even quicker for me. When I returned the same lady greeted me  she talked me through the different frames you offer and again she was great. Then the optician called me through  from the moment I sat down he did not seem to have the time of day for me  I explained what I needed my glasses for and how I had been having migranes recently  but I furthur explained how I had been working a lot more and tried to make light of things with little jokes  which were not well recieved. During the appointment he was very rushed and seemed to be accusing me of faking eye-sight problems. He was changing lens  asking me if I could see a difference when I was answering honestlty he kept asking me if I was sure  and then the icing on his rude cake he said the line a health professional should never say   Are you sure  because we all love to say yes.  Overall he made me feel as though he did not have time for me  he did not want to help me  and he did not belive that I needed my glasses  (which I have been recieving on prescription from Tesco for 4 years). Sadly he was not wearing a name badge  lucky for him as I would most certainly name drop. I bought my glasses as I was in a rush  but I will not be visiting your opticians again.",

The driver accidentally snapped off the waste pipe that leads from our bathroom to the outside drain.  I appreciate that accidents happen and anticipated that Tesco would work quickly to agree a plan for fixing the damage caused.  However  despite phone calls by my husband chasing a resolution we have been passed from pillar to post with none of your managers willing to take responsibility.  On 2 April it was confirmed to us that the matter had been  escalated  to Head Office  but more than a week on  and 3 weeks after the incident we have received no communication from Head Office.  As a loyal Tesco customer spending an average of \u00a3500 - \u00a3600 in Tesco stores every month I am disgusted with this level of customer service and look forward to hearing from you with a suitable resolution to this situation.",

Edinburgh based. Very unhappy. So no confirmation the items made it back to store (as delivery driver had no reader with him and n paper for me to sign to say I received order)  and no confirmation at all the items would be refunded and apparently this is exactly how it should be because the manager of Corstorphne store Edinburgh says apparently and the young man in Tesco customer services that Tesco has no obligation to confirm the items were received back at store or that a refund would take place- the vegetables delivered  that were returned had gone slimy in the packet and were out of date the next day on a 10pm delivery.",

    "post_message": "HI  Apologies if this is not quite relevant to this page. Having looked on the Tesco Direct website this morning for a cordless power drill  I found one on offer with yourselves at the bargain price of \u00a319. Great!  After using the *stock in your local store* button  I established there were stock available in your Stalybridge store. Great! So off I went to the Stalybridge store  searched high and low for said drill and couldn\u2019t find it. I asked a member of staff who informed me that the Stalybridge store does not stock this item. Erm\u2026.what about available stock showing online? Not so great!  I decided to look for another store which had stock in by using the *stock in your local area* button  I noticed Oldham  Huddersfield Road had some showing in stock. So off we went  parked up and in I went. Yey I found the item I wanted on the shelf with about 10 others. Took it to the till to see \u00a333 on the self serve screen\u2026hmm I thought this item was \u00a319? After asking a member of staff about the price difference I was told that this was an online offer not store offer and to speak to customer services. Nowhere online does it mention it is an online offer only and if this was the case  why have the option to search local stores for stock at this price??  I went to customer services and explained the price issue to the lady stood behind the counter. She said also it was an online offer and not available in store. So why was I allowed to search for local stores in the area that stocked this item??? At this price??? She explained I could buy it now with click and collect and come back tomorrow after 3pm to collect it  but would have to pay \u00a32 extra\u2026..what?? \u00a32 for what exactly? So if I have to pay \u00a32 extra  then the drill is not \u00a319 as clearly stated online  but it is in fact \u00a321! What is the difference between me picking the item up today and tomorrow? They were in stock! The woman on the customer service desk was less than helpful with such an attitude. I understand she can only give me information she has  but manners and compassion wouldn\u2019t have hurt her! If that\u2019s what she calls customer service  geez id hate to see what her bad customer service is like! I have never experienced customer service like this.  I am a loyal customer of Tescos and have been for many years  im going to reconsider this! Thanks for wasting my time today tescos!  An answer to this would be appreciated asap\u2026",

So if this incident is so bad then someone should have contacted your telephone team and then contacted the customers. I now have to rearrange my day to wait in for a delivery that may never come. As for the attitude of the customers services agent who basically said tough there s nothing that can be done. I would be sacked if I spoke to my customers that way. Technically Tescos are in breach of contract I will be cancelling my Direct debit and will be shopping with Asda from now on.",

A very helpful lady looked into the issue and said the delivery driver had tried and failed to deliver at 7.03pm  and had left a card. I can assure you both my husband and I were in at that time and in fact  I had been in the house all day. The doorbell works and there is a door that can be knocked on too. No card was left nor was any delivery attempted at my house. The customer services lady then contacted the delivery driver on our behalf who said he d try again at the end of his other deliveries and that she d call back at 9.30pm to see if we had received our groceries. At 9.30pm I got my call  from a man at the depot this time  who said they were organising another driver to meet the original one  collect our order and deliver it to us. Great  we thought  only two hours late but at least it s on its way. 10.10pm and we were still waiting for our order so I called the man back to see how things were going. This time I was told they can t deliver and will bring it tomorrow instead.  It is way past my bedtime  Tesco  and I wish this had been the solution originally rather than making me wait up all this time. Would I still be waiting now  had I not made that phone call? Now I sincerely hope  Tesco  that 1) I will not incur another delivery charge  since I understand that is the practice if the customer misses their original delivery slot  as I was actually at home at 7.03pm and 2) my delivery does indeed arrive tomorrow.  Yours faithfully  a tired customer.",

    "post_message": "Hi  I have sent this through to your customer services email but wanted to post on here  just to make sure the people mentioned get the feedback they deserve. I attended your Pontardawe store around lunch time on Thursday 31st March and would like to say thank you for the great customer service I received. This what happened:- It was my daughter s 5th birthday in 2 days so I had to go shopping for food for her birthday party and had to take my 2 children with me (age 2 and 4 at the time). Shopping with children can be stressful at the best of times  let alone when you have something important like a party to plan for. I had already been to 2 shops previously to visiting your Pontardawe store and had been out of the house with my children for 3 hours already so by this point I was slowly losing my patience and they were understandably bored. My son had started to throw a temper tantrum in the trolley and was screaming  I had a few looks off people judging me  who obviously didn t know the whole story. This wasn t what Peter did instead he asked my son what was the matter. And although my son didn t answer  he immediately stopped crying  which broke the tension. Peter was very friendly and carried on interacting with both of my children and by the time we walked away my children were much happier. At the time I didn t thank Peter as I was very stressed and in my own little world. I then proceeded to the self service checkout while I was scanning my items Gerry was talking to my children and kept them amused while I finished scanning my items. This is when I realised I should have thanked Peter for his earlier intervention. By the time I left your store I was much less stressed and my children were in a better mood too  which is very unusual for a shopping trip with children. People are very quick to complain (myself included) but forget to say thank you for good service. Peter and Gerry provided exceptional customer service and what may not have seemed like a big deal to them made a huge difference to my day!",

We were then told they had not received any photos. This was possibility because we had sent too many photos  so could we send just two! This we did. Since then we have emailed to ask what is happening as its been along time since we contacted you. And guess what no reply still. The TV was bought in October so it s still under guarantee. We just want a reply please. Unsatisfactory and incredibly bad customer service. Kind regards Unhappy customers.",

    "post_message": "I am appalled at Tesco so called Customer Service. Sent a complaint at the beginning of March regarding a Hudl. They agreed to refund \u00a330. Completed a BACS form on the 7th March  chased it up on the 17th March to be told that I had missed a digit and to phone. I phoned and got a very rude man who told me that he couldn t take any bank details over the phone and I had to fill in another form  which I did. The error I had made the first time was actually due to the form not allowing 0 to be the first digit  so I wrote this on my email. Was told in an automated reply that it would take 10 working days. Nothing happened so I sent an email  no reply. Asked through private message on here  and was told you had checked and it was going to be 14 working days which was today. Nothing in my account so I sent another message only to be told you have no record of my form being returned  despite being told last week that my 14 days was up on the 6th. Where did that info come from if you have no record of my form !!!",

I contacted Hotpoint two and a half months ago and was assured that I would receive a date for an engineer to visit within 8 weeks. It was hard enough to get in contact with Hotpoint as they don t answer their phone lines. Needless to say  Hotpoint failed to get in contact with me to arrange the engineer. As my dryer was purchased from Tesco Direct  I also contacted them to express my concerns about the dangerous dryer over 6 weeks ago. I was informed that I would be passed to a customer service agent who would be in contact with me within 24 hours. This never happened. I feel very disappointed that Tesco and Hotpoint appear to be acting in a negligent way towards their customers.

At no point has anyone offered me any sort of compensation for the calls and time out of my day to sort this  or a refund for the missing items or for the delivery  given that I am likely to have to make a special trip to buy these items when the whole point of me paying to get them delivered last night was so that I didn t have to go to the store myself and would have the food in time to cook this evening s dinner.",

I walked into your store at balby Doncaster and my 2 year old tripped up due to the mat that you wipe you feet on being lower than the floor in places . she banged her head and was screaming for a good ten minutes not one member of staff who saw what happened asked me if she was OK and nobody offered any first aid assistance my husband went and told customer services to be told there was nothing they could do about it the manager then gave her a teddy and rung it through to accident support And she was still offered no first aid assistance which according to the person on the phone who my husband spoke to is your policy I then asked for another bear for her twin sister and how much would it be a member of staff gave us the bear and didn t tell me a price or scan it in so I could pay for it I then left the store and was chased out by a member of staff to be told I had to pay for the bear when I had already asked how much it was and was ignored because they could waste one bear not 2 quite frankly I think it s disgusting and the worst bit was no first aider I won t be shopping at tesco again",

I was told they weren t able to tell me that but as soon as they were back in  they would be available on the website. I checked every day for two weeks but still none available. I then emailed customer services again just to ask whether the trousers would definitely be coming back into stock  only to be told they also couldn t tell me that but as soon as they were  they would be available on the website. However I could try visiting some other tesco extra stores to see if they have them in. Helpful. Surely someone knows if they will come back into stock eventually or could check stores  stock and order me a pair to collect?",

I advised them three times (by going into store and calling the main head office) that I couldn t see. Finally I am told by the head office just pop back to the store they ll retest you yeah right!  No I had to come back a few days later after a major operation I did not need to be making my fourth trip to the optician. But I did to find out that the optician had written the axis as 15 instead of 115 I was offered a bunch of flowers for my trouble at the time I just wanted my glasses so I said no please just get my glasses sorted. Now I have made several calls to the rubbish liars at customer services head office as in the mean time I ve had to love house but my glasses have to go to the original store first.  20 days later my clear pair arrive at Northampton I m called as they need to send them to Ely. They get to Ely three days later to find out that the sun glasses (bearing in mind the hot weather is almost over now) haven t been made yet!!! So I call customer rubbish sorry services again at head office no they haven t been made no due date I ll get a regional manager to call you here I am 5 days later no call!!! Ha ha ha then I m asked to do a customer satisfaction questionnaire are you kidding me!!! Yes in still 26 days later have no second pair no idea when they will arrive and no customer service at all. The clear pair are uncomfortable and not worth the money  My advice better service and glasses at Specsavers don t even bother with Tescos!!! I played nice till now and now I ve had enough please feel free to share my experience as I would hate for other people to suffer such a poor service.",
