    "post_message": "Great customer service in Tesco Hardwick King s Lynn this afternoon! Self scanned my shop through and noticed one of the make-up items had gone through at a higher price than I d expected. I wanted to check I d not picked up the wrong item by mistake so went back to the cosmetic area where a very helpful lady (I think maybe the cosmetics manager) helped me to check my purchased products to identify which one had gone through at the wrong price then accompanied me back to Customer Services to rectify the error by refunding me double the difference! She also identified through our conversation that we had inadvertently dropped a mascara through the trolley on our rounds as someone had recently returned it to her to be put back on the shelf...saving me the upset of the  tween  it was purchased for!!! Well done Tesco Hardwick  couldn t ask for better service. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> (If you can identify the lady she had dark hair in a bun and was in smart work wear not Tesco uniform)  the lady who processed the refund was also very helpful!

    "post_message": "ANYONE CONSIDERING ORDERING FROM THE EASY ENTERTAINING RANGE PLEASE BE AWARE THAT EVEN IF YOU PROVIDE TESCO WITH THE REQUIRED NOTICE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR ORDER!!!!! I recently placed an order for the Tesco Easy Entertaining range for a special party we were having on Saturday 6th Aug.  They ask that you give 3/4 days notice  more on some items when placing the order. I assumed that this was so they could ensure they had sufficient time to prepare my food.  Unfortunately  I was wrong. I received an email Fri evening  my delivery was booked for between 10pm and 11pm  to advise me that the mini classic cupcakes I d ordered were unavailable.  I spoke to customer service who said he would contact the dot com manager in the store who would ring me back.  He didn t  but the c/s advisor did to let me know there was a supplier issue and that I hadn t been charged. Really! I certainly would not expect to pay for something you couldn t supply.  My delivery arrived early and the driver was lovely  the only positive thing about this whole experience  but when checking my order we found that not only were the 36 classic cupcakes missing but so were 36 mini cupcakes and 60 mini savoury eggs. The driver was very apologetic  he knew nothing about the shortages  even though they are supposed to be advised.  Once again I had to ring customer service to complain. The girl I spoke to found it hard to believe there were no substitutes at all for the mini savoury eggs. I know I d ordered the value range but surely supplying the next price range up would have provided better customer service than sending nothing at all!  Saturday morning was spent trying to source 72 mini cupcakes and 60 mini savoury eggs  something that I had expected to prevent by ordering from the Easy Entertaining range.  Having successfully found the necessary items in Asda  I returned home to receive a phone call from my local Tesco to tell me the cupcakes had come in on the delivery that morning and were available if I wanted them. I told her  very politely  that I d had to get them elsewhere and that I wouldn t be using or recommending that service to anyone  ANYONE CONSIDERING ORDERING FROM THE EASY ENTERTAINING RANGE PLEASE BE AWARE THAT EVEN IF YOU PROVIDE TESCO WITH THE REQUIRED NOTICE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR ORDER!!!!!",

    "post_message": "2 weeks ago.. Our Microwave from Tesco s caught fire when I say caught fire I mean flames/smoke and the most awful smell ever  it required a fire blanket etc to put out the flames..  But this could have been a much different post as my little boy was in the kitchen at the time..  I decided was gonna take my barely used microwave back to the store (Oak Tree Lane  mansfield) I had the but could I heck as like find the receipt  I have every receipt back to 2010 lol) Once in-store I explained the situation to Mel (Tech) he told me not to worry as customer service could track the transaction my club card history.. and phoned them for me-i explained the situation to customer service although they were helpful they said it would take up to two weeks to track the transaction.. I was a bit miffed but ok with this as I really just wanted Tesco to be aware there was an issue with this microwave.. especially given the fact it had also scorched my worktop on a 30 second bottle warm.  However Mel wasn t.. he looked over the microwave and was shocked/almost 4 days later the smell in-store was toxic from the microwave.  He said he was going to get the store manager and show him.. again the manager was shocked..  Mel said there was no way this should have happened and that if there was anything that could be done he d find it..  During my time in-store he listened.. was polite/knowledgeable and curtious and a true gentleman.  He understood that I d been uncomfortable about taking the item back but reassured me I d done the right thing..  In the end I did get a full refund on my microwave but opted to do some research before purchasing another microwave.  I think alot of staff and other stores learn alot from this guy..  Fabulous customer service!!  P.s. I have tried numerous times to write this review your website using the correct methods but It won t work/save???",

They then called me back to say it s being put on a van but can t give me a delivery time so not only was I waiting in last night  I m sat in now for god knows how long waiting for delivery  meaning plans with my children are out of the window!! Oh and originally I was told  we will cancel your order and process a refund which takes a few days  And we will reorder but that means for a few days you ll have 2 payments going out for your shopping until the refund is processed  I don t think so!!  Magically my posts been removed <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A1>  I don t think refunding my delivery charge is going to cut it!!",

Refused to do so and went to speak to the duty manager (Sharon?) who left  me waiting for over 20 mins and then only to be told she was unavailable to speak to me as she was in a meeting and would ring me later!!

    "post_message": "Well just wanted to say a massive thankyou to your customer service staff in tesco broughton. On Thursday 22nd Dec I was rushing round doing my Xmas food shop (10pm) when I walked past a cage in one of the aisles. The cage ripped my brand new coat on the sleeve and I was gutted. I mentioned it to the staff member who was emptying the cage who told me to go and speak to customer service. Which I did  and was told straight away without hesitation that it would be sorted. I was advised to buy a replacement coat or bring the original receipt in  for my coat. I went away feeling annoyed and stressed as I had so much other stuff to do for Xmas. Anyway  today I received my replacement coat that I ordered on line and went into store to speak to customer service. Straight away they said told me that I would get the full amount that I paid for my replacement without hesitation.  Thankyou so much tesco... You have made me very happy x",

    "post_message": "Hello      I was shopping in your Tesco Silverburn store on Monday 18th December when after being in for around 20 minutes; I noticed my Next shopping bag wasn\u2019t on my person anymore. I dropped my basket and ran around the aisles I\u2019d been to see if I had mislaid it etc. It wasn\u2019t there. I started to really panic and get quite upset as the next bag had \u00a370 worth of baby outfits inside. I\u2019d only bought them 20 minutes previous. I ran to the customer services desk  where they told me no (and without any obvious empathy either) I asked the security men who were standing by the door  at the CCTV cameras  if anyone had handed to them. They said no. I said would there be any way they could quickly check past 5 minutes of cctv incase the bag and potential thief were still in the store. They told me no and that I would have to come back tomorrow?! (Helpful). I  again  ran around all the aisles. At this point  I was actually crying with panic because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to buy these presents again. I asked a few employees again if anything had been handed in. They all said no... One actually said \u2018naw hen  it\u2019s probably been lifted!\u2019\u2026 Not very helpful and frankly quite upsetting.      I stood at the door. Revisited the customer service desk and the various other desks (opticians etc.) a couple more times before I eventually gave up and left to go home. On the way home  I remembered an area I hadn\u2019t revisited. I tried calling customer services to see if there would be any way they could check the specific area for me  as I don\u2019t live near this particular Tesco. I got through to a call centre. They told me to drive back if I wanted to check it. (Wish I\u2019d have thought of that myself Mrs Brains!?!)  From that point on  I got the local customer services number and proceeded to call the desk 13 times in total over a 6 hour period. They either never answered or hung up when they heard my voice. I spoke to one lady from these 13 attempts who seemed to be the only helpful employee in the whole store. She did check the area for me- unfortunately the bag wasn\u2019t there either.     I returned to the store the following day to query the CCTV. The gentleman phoned his colleague to come down to the main entrance where my partner & I were waiting. I told him the exact time I entered the store  what I was wearing  what bags I was holding and told him the first place I headed for. He left and told me to come back in 15 minutes once he\u2019d looked at the playback. When he returned  the gentleman said these exact words \u2018Yes I can see you on the camera. You came in with the bag and left without it\u2019\u2026..    He\u2019d spent 15/20 apparently looking at CCTV... to tell me that? Useless information that I quite obviously KNEW. He then proceeded to lie to me... \u2018When you came in  you veered over to the right and I didn\u2019t catch where you went after that\u2019... I replied \u2018No  I didn\u2019t go over to the right at all? I went straight ahead. I went straight for the wrapping paper?\u2019 He replied \u2018No cos I seen you and your boyfriend go that way?\u2019\u2026    My boyfriend hadn\u2019t been with me.       I am a retail manager. I regularly watch CCTV. I asked him had he not followed my route? Had it been the other way around... I would have followed a customer in segments to see at what point the bag wasn\u2019t on their person anymore... Not only could I narrow it down and save myself time... but I also then be able to inform the customer of where & when exactly the bag was taken. I told him this. I wrote down my full route of the store and asked him to look at it for me. He said it would take him couple of hours... I reluctantly agreed that he could just call me instead. He said he\u2019d phone me that night once he could confirm what the fate of the bag was. After this  I began to wonder how he\u2019d seen me leave without my shopping bag if he hadn\u2019t followed my route? Probably another lie...     That was the 19th December. It\u2019s now the 31st. I\u2019ve never received that call back.   As a retail manager  I am genuinely appalled at this level of customer service. To show no empathy to a young girl who is visibly upset is bad enough. To ignore calls  hang up on customers  lie to their face and never give them the call back promised to them is horrific.   To make matters worse  I\u2019ve since been informed by an employee of the next store that I also revisited  that Tesco Silverburn are hopeless at helping people in circumstances like this. That is awful. I will never step foot in your store again. I know Tesco won\u2019t care that 1 person  a number like me won\u2019t shop there again... but hopefully people reading this never have to rely on the staff of the Tesco Silverburn store ever again. They are useless and quite clearly have no regard for their customers and their customers\u2019 possessions.",

On numeorus occasions they have snapped at customers for asking on issues why actual prices are different than display prices. I and my mother are regular customers  here for more than 6 years and previously we are customers at tesco kajang. Further necessities like sugar or salt or vegetables if out stocks are not stocked promptly. The cashiers or staffs loosely will address most female customers as aunty.They refer my mother who is in her mid 60s as aunty and I in mid 30s as aunty.What is the actual meaning of aunty? Does cashiers and staffs at UK Tesco refer to their female customers as aunty? Why in the earth they make us as their relatives? And today when I asked a temporary cashier at counter 17 around 7.30 pm  why she addressed me as aunty  she replied thats what they were trained to call customers like that. She didn t even apologise for wrong use of language.When I correct her that she is in customer service line and she should address customers promptly like sir  madam or ms (in malay cik or encik).Mind you I was not shouting or scolding at her.However she snapped and started to throw the items I have purchased  after  she finished scanning prices and when I asked her to stop doing that she didnt bother to apologise or stop. She continued to throw my credit card and receipt. I immediately I told I will lodge a complaint against her  she just said thank you very much. I can t bother to complaint there as previously other rude incident took place in front of the line leader or supervisor but he didnt bother.Disappointed with bad customer service.",

I reported that he was in a parent and child space to customer service and even pointed him out  he verbally abused me in the store and the lady I reported it to asked him if he was parked in a P&C space  he replied yes but I only came in for a magazine  to which she replied  oh  ok then .....  The car park wasn t full  and in fact there was a vacant parking space right outside the door.   How is it acceptable for this to happen? Maybe I should park in the disabled parking and do the same?

    "post_message": "Just wanted to say how appalled I am with the customer service I received at the customer services desk at Tesco Western Avenue 27/12/16. I went there yesterday to exchange a gift my neephew had for Christmas. I was told to take a non electrical toy to the electrical desk  when asked why as it s not electrical the staff member said she would serve me. I explained I didn t have a receipt and she just smiled at me. I chose a few items went back to the desk and she told me I had to find items to the same value and couldn t put the difference on a gift card. So off I went and did some food shopping. I picked up some wrapping paper and a member of staff told me they were still in the 3 for 2 offer even though they were reduced. I took all my bits to the desk to get served for the 3rd time and asked her to check if the paper was in the offer to which she smiled at me in-between chatting to her mates at the desk. I was told yes (in reply to my question about the paper and it came up on the till) Brilliant I thought  managed to pay the difference for my good in between her chatting to her mates and hardly looking at us let alone speak to us. She was so engrossed in her conversation  she didn t ask if I had a Clubcard. So after serving me I asked her to add the point to which she huffed. I left the store biting my tongue. Got home and checked my receipt and the wrapping paper didn t come up as 3 for 2. Im more annoyed with the fact that she had no time for us as customers and was more interested in talking to her colleague mates and was dismissive of us more than the fact she blatantly had no idea i had asked about the paper and just smiled at me.",

However  Tesco bank were not so helpful. We pay money into Tesco clubcard plus account every month throughout the year to pay for our Christmas shopping. When we came to pay this year however we were told to use alternative payment even though we knew there was enough money in the account. Customer service phoned the bank who couldnt help as account wasnt set up for phone banking. This account was set up in 1997 when it wasnt the norm for telephone banking and we have used the card every year without a problem. So that was the end of that  they couldnt do anything about the fact we had no way of paying for our Christmas food. Thank you Tesco  you have a lot of our money in an account we can t access until we get sent a password in the post <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00A0>.

I ordered from Tesco direct to be delivered Wednesday and was told twice to come back.  Went back today and the delivery was not there  had gone to the wrong store.  Everything in it was for stocking fillers/Xmas presents and while the girl on the counter (Donna) could not fix the situation she showed a genuine care and went to get a manager (Colin I think)  The manager walked me round the store to try find viable alternatives but there were none. While I don t have the goods I do feel that my custom is valued and your team do care so thank you for that.",

    "post_message": "A couple of weeks ago I did my weekly shop at Tesco Leytonstone with my son who is 7. He likes to ride his scooter to Tesco as we live locally. He always leaves his scooter in the correct place at the front with all the other scooters and buggies. After we finished our shop we were leaving when we realised we had forgotten my sons scooter so he ran back inside to get it. My son came back out in tears. He told me your security guard had called him a  stupid boy  because he had knocked someone elses scooter over. I went back inside to ask the security guard what had happened but immediately he was very aggressive verbally and started shouting at me. I asked for his name but he declined to give it to me so I took a picture of him that I can show you privately to identify. I then went to customer services and asked to speak with a manager. I told your manager what had happened and it really was evident my son was telling the truth because as I was telling the manager the security guard was telling other people about it and pointing at us. Your manager apologised to me and my son and let him chose out a box of chocolates as an apology which was very kind of you. Another of your workers at customer services told me that this was not the first time there had been problems with security guards but that there was little to be done because they are employed by a different company and not Tesco. As we were leaving the security guard was shouting at the manager who was trying to deal with the situation. I found this appalling but felt it better to leave it at that.  However I have now felt compelled to write a complaint on here because the security guard has since appear intimidating to us when we have gone back to Tesco Leytonstone on different occasion to do our weekly shop. Last week as myself and my son were walking into Tesco to do our weekly shop he pointed at us out to another security guard and was I assume telling his colleague god knows what about us. I ignored this. However today I popped in to Tesco Leytonstone with my son to pick up some last minute items. As we were walking down one of the isles the security guard walked up to us  stopped and starred at my son up and down. Again I ignored this and just pulled my son along by the hand.   This is not acceptable behaviour. I should be able to do my shopping in Tesco without feeling intimidated or worried. I live local and have shopped at Tesco Leytonstone since it opened. In fact I was present at Tesco Leytonstone when Dirty Den from Eastenders came to cut the ribbon to officially open the store! I spend a lot of money at Tesco Leytonstone as we dont have much of a high street and its literally around the corner from me but I will be forced to shop elsewhere should this sort of intimidation and unprofessional behaviour continue. I am being treated like what feels a potential thief and who knows what he has told other staff about me/us? If you are unable to do anything about this security guard then please could you provide me with the security firm he works for so I can make an official complaint to them about him.",

    "post_message": "Just wanted to say how disappointed i was with tesco customer service today.  My mum sent my family and i a \u00a3100 tesco voucher to spend on extra christmas treats but sadly when our post arrived this morning it had been removed from the envelope.  Royal mail refused to even search the postmans bag and so we turned to tesco for some help. After trawling every shopping bag in the house my very upset mum managed to find a receipt that had the whole gift card number on it. Several calls to tesco later and they agreed to block the card from being used and even offered \u00a350 (sent to us via royal mail - no thanks!!) As a goodwill gesture instead of the \u00a3100 voucher that had already been purchased. We requested a number of times that the full balance be transfered to a new card or even an online evoucher as we use tesco online weekly to do our \u00a3200 food shop. This was absolutely  point blank refused. Why? We can prove the card was purchased  have receipts and credit card statements to back this up yet tesco  2 days before christmas wouldnt allow us the gift that had already been paid for for us.   We now have to rely on a post office claim form to POSSIBLY come up trumps and find our missing voucher but have been told it could take up to 12 weeks just to be processed. Assuming it hasnt already been pocketed by someone - likely!  #tesco  i am incredibly disappointed in your lack of cooperation today. The gift card was lost  we didnt want a refund  just the funds transfered so they could be spent in your store!  Bah humbug!",

No  it was under \u00a310 and not one of  the  Christmas toys of the year. She just wanted some pyjamas to go with the Sindy doll. For some reason  the doll is available on line but the outfits arent?? I had friends and family search in their Tesco for the outfits  but with no luck.  So I thought I would contact you. It all looked extremely hopeful. You have me two stores locally that were due delivery of the outfit my daughter wanted  you ensured that one was going to be put by for a friend to collect for me. My friend went in as arranged and one hadn t been put by. She was told they were out of stock and were due delivery on a Monday evening so to go back in Tuesday morning. Still nothing. We were told they were due in but couldn t say when  so my friend has been in every day checking for me. I was told they were out of stock  then I was told that store was due some but couldn t tell me when.  In the end I had to make the decision to get an alternative product for my daughter as you clearly weren t going to produce any.  I feel we have been sent on a wild goose chase  been made promises that haven t been kept and been lied to. Not great customer service from Tesco and I haven t got my daughter exactly what she asked Santa for Christmas. Thanks for that Tesco!!",

Incidentally  Ben and Jerry s Phish food is clearly offered at 2 for \u00a36 on your website!  This tells me one of two things... A. This is a deliberate act to mislead customers. Or B. Your staff have received poor training.  Needless to say I requested and received a refund for the items  but this was a pretty irritating waste of time  as petty an issue as it may seem!",

    "post_message": "I am absolutely appalled with Tesco Grocery today. My groceries were delivered on time  but with several Christmas dinner items missing. I immediately called customer services who contacted the driver to arrange re-delivery. The driver returned and stated that he had delivered my items to another customer and although he had been back there  he didn\u2019t have my missing items. He offered me a crate of items to look through for my items \u2018or something similar\u2019  there weren\u2019t any. He advised he would contact the warehouse with a list of my missing items and have them sent out to me today. I contacted Customer services again (10am) to ensure that this had happened - it had not.   Customer services contacted the store and called me back stating the items would be redelivered today and that the store would call me with a time slot.  At 1:30pm I had not heard from the store so  again  contacted customer services to enquire about my missing groceries. I was put on hold while the store was contacted only to be told that the store \u2018didn\u2019t have the man power to redelivery my groceries today as they already had 120 redeliveries from yesterday\u2019. The customer services manager advised that my items would then be refunded.  I asked to be transferred to a team leader who advised he would again contact the store or try to have the items put aside in a local express store. On calling back  he  again  said the store would not redeliver due to a lack of \u2018man power\u2019 and that no local store had all of the items that were missing - what a surprise two days before Christmas!   Clearly  Tesco  you have overstretched yourselves and are unable to fulfil the orders that you have taken. Online grocery shopping is supposed to be convenient and stress free - it has been neither today. After one redelivery  4 phone calls and 6 hours of waiting  I now have to shop for my missing goods.  Absolutely unacceptable.",
